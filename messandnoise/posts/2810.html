                <h3>Two-thirds of the Dirty Three are responsible for some of the best Australian punk ever. <strong>TIM SCOTT</strong> embraces a reissue of Venom P Stinger&#8217;s 1986 debut LP.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3036744/794x794-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="440"/><br/>
Their 2004 Meredith performance under an apocalyptic storm is now legendary, but the few times I&#8217;ve seen the Dirty Three I can&#8217;t help but think Jim White and Mick Turner &#8211; the two guys either side of the high-kicking and caterwauling Warren Ellis &#8211; were responsible for one of my favourite punk songs.</p>
<p>Venom P Stinger&#8217;s ?Walking About? stands as one of the best and most demented Australian punk songs ever. Released as a 7? in 1988 on Aberrant Records, it&#8217;s a guttural and menacing beast that starts with Turner&#8217;s trebly guitar and White&#8217;s flittery jazz snare before wild man Dugald McKenzie howls, ?They got my car, they got my house/They got the keys to my door, I can&#8217;t get out.? With Alan Secher-Jensen on bass, the Melbourne four-piece had written, performed and produced a near-perfect song about self-destruction, self-loathing and despair.</p>

<p/>
<p>When MacKenzie wails, ?I&#8217;m walking about,? you feel it&#8217;s because he has no place physically or emotionally to walk to. Cosmic Psychos wrote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=0HRVhWAepK8">?Custom Credit?</a> around the same time &#8211; a song similar in sound and sentiment &#8211; but Venom P Stinger were a dirtier, more ominous force. The Psychos were about pubs. Venom were about hot and suffocating house parties. A far cry from the <a href="/articles/4447237">Sydney Opera House</a> or the <a href="/articles/4148293">Meredith Supernatural Amphitheatre</a> where the Dirty Three now perform.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The darkness of The Birthday Party, the untethered rawness of Flipper and plain art-punk weirdness.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Chicago&#8217;s Drag City is a label with a strong Venom P Stinger connection, having released Mick Turner <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/mick-turner">solo albums</a> as well as his collaboration with White as <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/mick-turner-and-tren-brothers">Tren Brothers</a>. Drag City have reissued the VPS <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/venom-p-stinger">back catalogue</a> on vinyl, including the <em>Walking About* 7?, the classic *Meet My Friend Venom* debut LP from 1986, the 1990 &amp;What&#8217;s Yours is Mine* LP and the *Waiting Room* EP, which is on vinyl for the first time. This is all included on a double-CD set fittingly titled *1986-1991</em>.</p>
<p>Of all their releases, <em>Walking About* stands as the strongest but *Meet My Friend Venom</em> is the best introduction to a band who took the darkness of The Birthday Party, the untethered rawness of Flipper and plain art-punk weirdness and made it their own.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TV_sqvLID3o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>In Caulfield South in the early ?80s, McKenzie and Turner were part of the extremely raw and intense Sick Things. A band who covered the Germs? ?Shut Down? and Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#8217;s? ?The Sound of Silence? but could also pulverize on their own  such as the <em>Committed to Suicide</em> 7?. Their shows at venues like Prahran&#8217;s Duke of York ended as wild and chaotic affairs.</p>
<p>Turner had also played in <a href="/icons/4576645">The Moodists</a> and Fungus Brains, another noise-punk powerhouse. Also on the scene was Jim White, who was playing in several bands, including <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/People+With+Chairs+Up+Their+Noses">People With Chairs Up Their Noses</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=G0gnEyfI3FE">Feral Dinosaurs</a>. Venom P Stinger became a feral mix of all these elements.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;ve not experienced a PCP-induced psychosis but I imagine this to be a pretty authentic account.?</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Meet My Friend?* was released on No Masters Voice, the Melbourne label run by Paul Conroy, who released the first 7? for hardcore band <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=UQYwvXLH6vU">Civil Dissident</a> as well as the classic Australian punk comp </em><a href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-Eat-Your-Head/release/1766510">Eat Your Head</a>. The story goes that Conroy saw the band performing for the first time at the Prince of Wales in St Kilda then straight after the show offered to release their record.</p>
<p>Album opener &#8211; and the band&#8217;s most well-known song &#8211; ?PCP Crazy? again starts with White&#8217;s martial drum beat backed by Turner feedback before McKenzie&#8217;s agitated tale of a guy strung out on PCP riding on a train. The drumbeat adds to the hypnotic feel of a train ride on which ?he was making people squirm.? Halfway through it goes pure spazz with the guitar frantically taking over. I&#8217;ve not experienced a PCP-induced psychosis but I imagine this song to be a pretty close and authentic account of one.</p>

<p/>
<p>There&#8217;s a rich excitement in listening to a band playing outside the lines of playing tight enough. But only just. In listening to guitarist and drummer who can reel out and reel in the frenzied attack of someone like McKenzie. But to be honest, McKenzie did most of his own reeling. The spirit of Mark E Smith&#8217;s corrosive and chanted vocals comes though in tracks like ?And Suddenly?. Dark and despondent.</p>
<blockquote><p>?His songs and lyrics were honest. Sometimes as blunt as a prison shank, but they cut just as deep.?</p></blockquote>
<p>MacKenize battled demons. There was no secret at the time that he lived a wild life. The son of a doctor who came from an upper-middle-class family and attended Scotch College, he later struggled with alcohol and drug problems. Stories abound of the crazy shit he got up to. He was denied entry to the US when the band tried to tour and he sadly died of bone cancer in 2004.</p>
<p>But his songs and lyrics were honest. Sometimes as blunt as a prison shank, but they cut just as deep. ?Jaws? is sung from the point of view of someone getting attacked by a shark. Though their lifestyles could not be further apart, I swear there is one part on ?Flourish Wish? where he sounds like Ian McKaye from <em>Repeater</em>-era Fugazi </p>
<p>Venom P Stinger&#8217;s take on punk was far from middle of the road even by punk standards. ?Jaws II? begins with some abstract and free-form noise. Most of their other tunes begin with a simple beat and a few chords but soon rev into noisier, wilder territory. Turner&#8217;s twisted guitar style set them apart, as did White&#8217;s drumming, whose rolls simply simmered.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBTjXTbAsgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>?Hold Me Closer?, with its stumbling, Gun Club-like country dirge and whacked organ, is probably the closest Venom P Stinger got to a love song. An anxious love song with lines like ?I can no longer help myself/This feeling&#8217;s so strange/It&#8217;s like a tumour in my head.?</p>
<p>By 1990?s <em>What&#8217;s Yours is Mine</em>, the songs had become slightly more standard. Standard for Venom P Stinger, at least. The band were still pushing it and McKenzie was still a mad frontman, but he&#8217;d stopped turning up to rehearsals and gigs and even before he was replaced by Nick Palmer for a short time it sounds like the band were on their way out.</p>
<p>Still, <em>Meet My Friend Venom* is one of the three best Australian punk records of all time, up there with The Saints? *(I&#8217;m)* Stranded and The Chosen Few&#8217;s *The Joke&#8217;s On Us!</em>.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>####?Meet My Friend Venom? is out now through Drag City, along with with the band&#8217;s entire <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/venom-p-stinger">back catalogue</a>. The 2CD set ?<a href="http://www.dragcity.com/products/1986-1991">1986-1991</a>? is also out in Australia through R.I.P. Society/Fuse Music.</p>
