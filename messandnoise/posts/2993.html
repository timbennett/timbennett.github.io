                <h3>Ahead of their ?Don&#8217;t Look Back? performance and a new reissue, X&#8217;s Steve Lucas tells <strong>TREVOR BLOCK</strong> he feels born again.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002231/440x622-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
These days, the word most commonly used to describe Steve Lucas is ?survivor?. It&#8217;s an acknowledgement of the various trials and troubles that have dogged X over the past 30 years or so. But let&#8217;s leave all that aside.</p>
<p>The reissue of their classic debut album <em>X-Aspirations* is out on February 1 through Aztec Music, and they&#8217;re playing the next instalment of the ?Don&#8217;t Look Back? concert series at The Forum in Melbourne on Wednesday (January 14). A one-off event, it will see Lucas, drummer Cathy Green and bass player Kim Volkman hit the stage to play through X&#8217;s second album, *At Home With You*, before contemporaries The Saints take a tilt at their own awesome debut, *(I&#8217;m) Stranded</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of its original release in 1979, <em>X-Aspirations</em> sounded like nothing else &#8211; and it still doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not three-chord punk thrash (though it is, a bit) and it&#8217;s not overtly political (but again, it is, just a bit). There&#8217;s a sense of urgency and abandon to it that was echoed in the band&#8217;s live shows of the time. It was made under a certain set of conditions, and without them, it wouldn&#8217;t exist. And it was done almost off-the-cuff.</p>
<p>?Well, there&#8217;s not a lot to remember about the recording, it was done so quickly,? admits Lucas. ?I think we did it in about three-and-a-half hours. That ?five-and-a-half hours? that gets quoted all the time must include the mixing too. We went in to record a single, but then couldn&#8217;t decide what we wanted and Lobby (Loyde, producer) said, ?Why don&#8217;t you try and do an album??, so we did. Those 14 songs were all the songs that we knew &#8211; well, all the ones that I knew how to play. Remember, I&#8217;d only started playing guitar since [founding member] Ian Krahe died.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;d only been in a studio as a band once before, at the Film and TV School in Sydney, when the original four-piece line up [Lucas, Rilen, Steve Cafiero and Krahe] went in and recorded ?TV Cabaret Roll?, ?Hate City?, ?Good On Ya Baby? and ?Home Is Where The Floor Is?.<br/>
Actually, as I think about it, I&#8217;d recorded before that too. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever mentioned this before, but me, Ian Krahe, Tony Lush and Steve Harris &#8211; all school friends &#8211; we entered a 2SM battle of the bands thing, where you had to submit your songs on an actual single.</p>
<p>?We recorded a tune called ?Endless Night?, which was very Status Quo sounding, and something else for the B-side, and had a few copies pressed up. I&#8217;m not even sure what we called ourselves. We didn&#8217;t win anything, and I don&#8217;t have a copy of that single, but I&#8217;d love to hear it again.?</p>
<p><strong>What do you think gives <em>X-Aspirations</em> that edge, that different feel?</strong><br/>
X was a fusion of a few different things. Ian had that whole rock&#8217;n?roll bass playing thing going on, but definitely with his own style as well. He once told that someone from one of his earlier bands had told him to smoke loads of hash and just play scales all day, which he did, so he got very good at playing. He found a lot of what he&#8217;d done in the past a bit limiting though, and wanted to cut loose. And Steve Cafiero had been a drum roadie for the Easybeats; he had a very structured background and ideas about some things. He worked for ages on all his drum parts and wrote them all down. And once he had them written down, that was it. You weren&#8217;t allowed to deviate from them. So you had Ian cutting loose, Steve sticking to the charts, and me trying to sing and play guitar at the same time, when I only knew about six chords. It made for something unique.?</p>
<p><strong>This reissue means that two of my favorite X songs &#8211; ?Delinquent Cars? and ?TV Glue? &#8211; are now both available on CD.</strong><br/>
?Delinquent Cars? came about when a friend of ours wrote a little poem about a birthday party for one of Ian&#8217;s kids, about what was going on in the street, and the band playing and stuff. Ian was living in Darlinghurst then, near St Vincent&#8217;s hospital, which is where that reference came from. We thought it was great, so we took it and mucked around with and that was that.</p>
<p>Ian had the bass line and I think some lyrics for ?TV Glue?. I was fooling around trying to come up with a riff that might work for it, when he said, ?Wait, stop. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s perfect, just like that.? I thought it was kind of only half done, but it turned out it was all there [laughs]. That was a useful song when we used to do two sets, because you could open the second set with it and give everyone plenty of time to get back from the bar or whatever, or for Ian to finish his cigarette. And you could stretch it out as long as you wanted too, as long as it all came back together &#8211; wham! &#8211; after the spoken bit. I&#8217;ve had people ask me how to play that riff, and they show me how they think it goes and I say, ?Well, you might be surprised just how much simpler than that it actually is?, and show them. It&#8217;s this [bends fingers] and this [shifts fingers] and that [again]. Then you reverse it and repeat it, reverse it and repeat it. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Those 14 songs were all the songs that we knew &#8211; well, all the ones that I knew how to play.?</p></blockquote>
<p>But, you know, for a record that didn&#8217;t get much exposure, <em>X-Aspirations</em> got around a bit, and seems to have lasted pretty well. ?At Home? was different, it was in the local punk or independent charts or whatever for months. Plenty of people seem to like them still. [Sydney post-punk act] feedtime did ?I Don&#8217;t Wanna Go Out? on that covers album of theirs, Bored! and Mark Of Cain have both recorded versions of ?Degenerate Boy?, which You Am I sometimes throw into their live set too if I&#8217;m around to get up and sing it for them. Six Ft Hick play ?The Feel? live. Dimi Dero told me they wanted to cover something, but then they were too embarrassed to send me a copy. My favorite X cover though, was the version of ?I Don&#8217;t Wanna Go Out? some Norwegian guys did on a little Casio or something. It had this plinky-plonky Kraftwerk kind of sound to it. I thought that was excellent.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the <em>At Home With You</em> reissue?</strong><br/>
I love it. It makes me feel like a born again X-man. I think it&#8217;s a really full on job, a great package, and I think Gil [Matthews] did a beautiful job sonically. It sounds even better than the work he did on <em>At Home With You</em>.</p>
<p>When we recorded <em>At Home*, Lobby really pushed me hard to get that hoarse, broken-voiced sound. I&#8217;d do three or four takes and he insist on one more, a rawer one. I love the songs on both albums equally, it&#8217;s just the memory of the pain I went through making *At Home</em> that separates them for me. The version of ?Mother? on the reissue is much better too, I think. It has better vocals and Ian does something a bit different on the bass.</p>
<p>This has been reissued before. There was a red vinyl edition and Amphetamine Reptile did a CD version a few years back. But this is the first time it&#8217;s been issued on CD in Australia with, you know, the full package that they [Aztec Music] do.</p>
<p><strong>The Don&#8217;t Look Back series is a unique way of presenting acts, and albums. How did X get involved?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve really got no idea how or why we were invited to do this, but I&#8217;m glad we were. [Booker] Tim Pittman pretty much just called me out of the blue one day and offered it and, of course, I said yes. I&#8217;ve always wanted X to play with The Saints, but back in the day they never asked us, and we would never have asked them if we could. That wasn&#8217;t our style at all. We might have done a show or two with the Laughing Clowns in our time though, and I saw [The Saints?] Chris Bailey the last time he was out here with that version of the band. I&#8217;m friends with Archie Larizza, who&#8217;s playing in this line-up, and of course I knew Janine Hall too. It&#8217;s a nice juxtaposition of things that were going on at the time, us and them. And although we&#8217;re doing <em>At Home*, it&#8217;s interesting to look at *X-Aspirations* alongside *Stranded*. I think the two albums sound very different, though *Stranded</em> is much more polished for a start.</p>
<p>I think the concept is great, too. An album is, or can be, a stand alone work, a piece of art, like a painting or a sculpture, and this format gives you the chance to get a really good clear view of it. I can think of plenty of people who couldn&#8217;t pull it off, for sure. And you should be able to play your albums live and have them sound just as good. I hate bands who say, ?Here, this is our CD &#8211; but we don&#8217;t sound like this live.? Well, why not? Why not capture that live feel and sound? Isn&#8217;t that what recording is for?</p>
<p><strong>And you&#8217;ve recently branched out doing a bit of recording yourself.</strong><br/>
Well, I like to get out and about a bit, keep myself busy. Producing (Melbourne garage rockers) Dollsquad was a lot of fun. I basically tried to remember all the good things about working with Lobby and just do those with them. I told the band we&#8217;d do a run through &#8211; from start to finish &#8211; and then when it was done I said, ?Thanks, that&#8217;s great, you&#8217;ve just recorded your album.? There was a little bit of overdubbing, but not much. It&#8217;s laced with the odd little nod, or homage, here and there. They&#8217;ve had some interest in it, and it looks like it will get released in the UK, and possibly Greece. But I really enjoyed doing my bit, and would love to do more, for anyone who wants me to. Just come up and ask me.</p>

            <p>Mess + Noise was an Australian music news website and discussion forum. It was taken over by Junkee Media and later shut down. This is a partial archive.</p>
            <p>(Question marks instead of quotation marks? [Markdown links](<a href="http://commonmark.org/">http://commonmark.org/</a>) in text? At the time of scraping, the remnants of the M+N website weren't properly rendering the CMS contents to HTML.)</p>
