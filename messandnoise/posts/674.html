                <h3>Themes of dislocation and homesickness abound on The Panics? new album ?Rain On The Humming Wire?, but no matter the personal cost, singer Jae Laffer tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> they&#8217;re in this for the long haul.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022979/440x661-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Perth will always lay claim to The Panics, but for time being, Melbourne is the place that feels most like home. The band shifted here six years ago following the release of second album <em>Sleeps Like A Curse*, so tonight&#8217;s show at The Corner Hotel &#8211; the were midway through an east-coast mini-tour when *M+N</em> caught up with them in July &#8211; feels like a homecoming of sorts.</p>
<p>?Melbourne seems like the natural choice to come home to,? says frontman Jae Laffer, wide-eyed and smiling, from a booth in the Corner&#8217;s front bar. ?It&#8217;s been great except for the general West Australian complaints about not seeing the ocean.?</p>
<p>Perth is still an ongoing concern for The Panics. Their support for this tour is a likeminded pop-rock act from WA called <a href="/citizenship/4291939">Split Seconds</a>, while fourth album <em>Rain on the Humming Wire</em> is laden with imagery from Laffer&#8217;s upbringing in the hills just outside Perth &#8211; from a ?summer with no end in sight? (?Creatures?) to the peeling paint and brushfires in ?Not Quite Home?.</p>
<p>The album&#8217;s title, says Laffer, refers to the audible buzz emanating from the telephone wires in his neighbourhood after a downpour. During these quiet times, he&#8217;d look out the window and contemplate the future, but not even his 16-year-old self &#8211; a self-described loner who harboured ambitions of being a guitarist in a ?big band? &#8211; could&#8217;ve envisaged the journey the band has taken thus far.</p>
<p>After several years of hard graft, The Panics? 2007 single ?Don&#8217;t Fight It? helped land them an ARIA for Best Adult Contemporary Release and propel third album <em>Cruel Guards</em> to 35,000 domestic sales, not to mention a #62 placing on Triple J&#8217;s recent <a href="/articles/4293264">Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time</a>. It lead to an European theatre tour with Scottish singer Paolo Nutini, during which they based themselves in Salford &#8211; a blue collar suburb in Manchester, England &#8211; where they began work on album number four.</p>
<p><strong>So how&#8217;d you end up in Salford in the first place?</strong><br/>
Well, we&#8217;ve been there four times. The seed was planted when we first got our manager [Pete Carroll], who&#8217;s from Salford. All our music tastes and favourite bands were linked up to this [place]. We were all Brit-pop kids. That was our thing in high school: Stone Roses and [Happy] Mondays. Once he saw the stars in our eyes, he said, ?You should come over to where I grew up and spend some time there.? In his head he was probably thinking, ?Let&#8217;s harden these guys a little bit.?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s that sort of place?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really hard and there&#8217;s a lot of tough guys that stand in your way on the sidewalk. That&#8217;s absolutely fine. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be able to travel and go to the places of your heroes?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting because I guess London is the obvious trajectory for an Australian band.</strong><br/>
Yeah, and we&#8217;ve never done it. It&#8217;s like what Sydney is to us here: the big fun weekend. We were very wary all this time of going somewhere and being forced to spend more time thinking about where the money was gonna come from. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve maintained this thing of living together and pooling the money together, and going somewhere and really trying hard in a place without being too casual about it. This time, we were just like, ?Let&#8217;s go back to Manchester, stay half the year, tour through Scotland and England, and make it less about going out to nightclubs and more about working on the album.?</p>
<p><strong>Is Manchester were the seed of the album was planted, or were these songs kicking around before then?</strong><br/>
It was planted there. We were mostly just touring and releasing <em>Cruel Guards</em> at the time. We got a tour with [Scottish singer] Paulo Nutini, who was number one and very famous at the time. So we got to do a beautiful theatre tour through Scotland and England. At that time, we just kept going back through Manchester. </p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3022966/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>We had this space, it&#8217;s where [British band] Elbow record and rehearse. They&#8217;ve got a wicked building in Salford, it&#8217;s fucking great. While they were on tour, we got to play and do this thing [the album]. It&#8217;s a really beautiful, industrial, but poetic place in the world &#8211; It&#8217;s untouched since the industrial revolution of Manchester when it was a big warehouse, a bustling place. Now, it&#8217;s one of those places that&#8217;s just beautiful, but it&#8217;s all shadow and light, and lots of dark corners. Lots of places to tuck yourself away and work &#8211; We live in Collingwood here, so it [Manchester] is like a city of that. But it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take for the homesickness to set in?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s always a little bit of it, because we&#8217;re all kids from the sunny side of the country. It was dribs and drabs. Those of us who were in relationships, it would test it. Those things cave in and you start getting used to it.</p>
<p><strong>The album is redolent with those things: dislocation, homesickness and sunny Australian imagery.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve dwelt on that a lot in all our records. It&#8217;s one of our things. It&#8217;s a nostalgia thing, but we&#8217;re also a band that keeps together, that travels and goes to dark places, and then starts daydreaming about the places we come from.</p>
<p><strong>To me, it&#8217;s your most ?Australian?-sounding record, but it was conceived in New York and Manchester.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s not uncommon though, is it?</p>
<p><strong>The Triffids, the Go-Betweens. There&#8217;s a long history of that.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s weird, isn&#8217;t it? <em>Born Sandy</em> was all London.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you have to move overseas to make an Australian record?</strong><br/>
I guess not, but it&#8217;s a highly preferable thing to do. Not to make an Australian record, but to make any record, to keep inspired and to keep perspective on your life and where you came from. I think you have to go away. Often bands will ask you, ?Is that the way to do it?? And I&#8217;m like, ?I don&#8217;t know, man. You might just cave in really quickly.? But there&#8217;s a lot of strength in my band and we seem to be able to go to little corners of the world and always pull through. It&#8217;s always testing, but there&#8217;s a strong bond in the middle of it.</p>
<p><strong>Did you set out to make an ?Australian? record?</strong><br/>
No, that stuff&#8217;s all pretty default. I realised that sometimes what I find inspiring, or what gives me the shivers when I&#8217;m working, is to write random descriptions of environment. It must be boring to some people, but not me. The only way to make the most potent material possible is to figure out who you are and what makes you truly inspired &#8211; even if it&#8217;s the girl next door. If you grew up in the projects, you&#8217;ve got great material, but I didn&#8217;t. I just kept to myself and walked along by the beach or out in the bush. Sometimes I will write about that. It can become a good thing; a good setting to put characters in. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got, so that&#8217;s what I work with.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s this line on <em>Not Quite Home</em>, ?I&#8217;m on the outside, looking in?, I think that really sums up the record for me.</strong><br/>
That line sums it up for me a lot as well. You wonder why you spend all your 20s testing yourself like that &#8211; there&#8217;s other things you can be doing. There&#8217;s a beauty in all of it and I&#8217;m lucky enough to be able to put it down into song.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022971/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>The title is really evocative. Where does that imagery come from?</strong><br/>
That comes from the hometown hills of Perth. I&#8217;ve never had a title at the start. We&#8217;ll sit down right at the end and everyone will go through the lyrics. There was a line in <em>Creatures</em> &#8211; You talk about me writing about environment and places where I grew up, and that was the one; that was the hometown place where I grew up in the hills where you overlooked the city. I spent a lot of time alone. It was this thing, this post rain, literally buzzing &#8211; It sounds kina boring. But this is the time that I always remember thinking about the future: what would happen, where I was going. I always drift back to in a quiet moment. It&#8217;s almost like I check in with myself aged 16, ?How am I doing buddy?? I hope I&#8217;d be proud.</p>
<p><strong>And how do you think your 16-year-old self would feel about all this?</strong><br/>
I think he&#8217;d be pretty happy. [<em>Laughs</em>] I also think he&#8217;d be going, ?Man, I&#8217;m so sorry. I had no idea it involved so fucking much, that there&#8217;d be so many hurdles for you.? I always just wanted to be a lead guitarist in a big band when I was little. Things change over time. I mostly like reading words now, I don&#8217;t really practice guitar. I have an office at the moment. I go there most day and play piano and write stuff. This album&#8217;s been great for me. You can see it link up with the albums previous to this one. I also feel like I&#8217;ve bookended a lot of my thoughts. I really feel like it&#8217;s given me a great strength to try other directions. A lot of the things I&#8217;ve been singing about &#8211; the places and characters within the songs &#8211; a lot of them have been put to rest in a really nice way on this album.</p>
<p><strong>With this office you work in, do you sit there from nine to five like [US author] Philip Roth or Nick Cave?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s what I do. I take a lot of hints when I read about that. Even if I read a book for a couple hours, or whatever, that&#8217;s just become my thing. Over the past few years I&#8217;ve realised that&#8217;s the part of my life that I really want to step up and take pride in &#8211; to get a lot done. This album took a little bit too long. This [putting out records] needs to be happening every year-and-a-half from now on. I feel like I&#8217;ve got a lot to write about now.</p>
<p><strong>What was the songwriting dynamic like this time around? Was it more your record, or a collaboration?</strong><br/>
It was pretty collaborative, mostly because we were away a lot on our own together, especially in Manchester. You don&#8217;t have the friends and the girls around &#8211; all you can do is jam &#8211; So a lot of the music came together like that. I&#8217;ve always written most of the words, but I let the guys fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Who sings the last song [?Everything Is Quiet?]?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s Jules [Douglas]. He had a song on our record <em>Sleeps Like A Curse</em> called ?It&#8217;s Not a Thing?. It&#8217;s just nice for me to treat a Panics song with a real lighthearted approach: ?Just have a sing! Do you mind if I play the bass?? He [Jules] has had a tough year, so it was nice he had a song.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I can see why people go in for an anthem. It&#8217;s a highly powerful thing.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to talk about [first single] ?Majesty? for a second. I read the pro-Republican thing was accidental?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s only a few lines in that song that go down that [pro-Republican] path, but they resonate. It was just on my mind at the time &#8211; It&#8217;s a song with some pro-Republican sentiment and a couple of verses that touch on that. It&#8217;s just because that&#8217;s what I was reading at the time. I&#8217;d rather be talking to a journalist about that than the ex-girlfriend. [<em>Laughs</em>] I play it down a bit because I&#8217;d need to be a bit smarter about it if I was going to get on TV and debate it. But I have my feelings and I share them with a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>I think it&#8217;s a particularly strong statement given that issue&#8217;s been on the backburner of late. It&#8217;s been swept up in the whole royal wedding thing.</strong><br/>
The reaction to the royal wedding &#8211; it&#8217;s amazing people still get caught up in it. Nothing malicious against it, it&#8217;s just like, ?Come on!? Especially for the older generation, that glitz and ceremony is cool, it&#8217;s intriguing, but it&#8217;s also worth putting in a song, because it&#8217;s just a bunch of rich people. C&#8217;mon!</p>
<p><strong>Did you want to get it back on the agenda?</strong><br/>
I hope it does, but I certainly don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m capable of putting it there. It&#8217;s nice to have it out and about &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just in my conversations &#8211; and it will come back around again because it&#8217;s inevitable. Perhaps when it&#8217;s back on the agenda, I might get a few phone calls. But you have to respect the wishes of the country at the same time. If people have other things to think about, that&#8217;s fine as well.</p>
<p><strong>The kettle drums give it a real anthemic, almost military feel as well.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] I didn&#8217;t want to take that too over-the-top, but it was fun in the end. I&#8217;ve touched a few times on anthemic type songs, but I&#8217;ve never quite gone all in. There&#8217;s a big part of me that enjoys that part of my life. Whenever there&#8217;s been a big crowd, and we&#8217;ve got to do that kind of song &#8211; even if it&#8217;s ?Don&#8217;t Fight It? &#8211; I can see why people go in for an anthem. It&#8217;s a highly powerful thing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cruel Guards</em> came in at #62 in that triple j poll [Hottest Australian Albums of All Time]. What was your reaction to that?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s great, especially because it was being voted for before we were too much back in people&#8217;s faces &#8211; Trust me, when you spend years writing a record, you put it out and have two months of fun and no one thinks about it again, it&#8217;s really nice when years later people put it on a list, or you hear <em>Don&#8217;t Fight It</em> on the television during the football. It&#8217;s great that people keep you on the radar and keep talking about you.</p>
<p><strong>Did you get a sense at the time it was a special record?</strong><br/>
The songs on the new record go off on tangents, they don&#8217;t sound like they were done in the same place, because they weren&#8217;t. <em>Cruel Guards</em> was all of us living in a house in Collingwood. During the conversations at the start of it, I said I wanted to incorporate certain landscapes and colours and pictures into the songs. It was very focused at the beginning. We&#8217;ve never made a record that sounded like it was brilliantly complete, which has the best takes of everything. It happened quickly that one. I&#8217;m not the greatest fucking singer in the world, but I can always go back and listen to my voice and tell what I was feeling. I&#8217;m really thinking about what I&#8217;m singing most of the time, and I appreciate myself for that.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Isolation is the key word of our whole career: where we come from, the places we&#8217;ve gone. How long are we going to deny ourselves and all our loved ones??</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Did <em>Cruel Guards</em> create expectations for this record?</strong><br/>
Yeah, but that&#8217;s just from people telling us we&#8217;re onto a good thing. Pressure is whatever you make of it. It&#8217;s nice to be an ongoing concern to people. We&#8217;re not a huge band or anything, but when people talk to me about my music, it&#8217;s a privilege. The pressure&#8217;s not too much because it&#8217;s not that hard for us to come up with the music.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a gang mentality with The Panics. Do you all live together, or just you, Drew and Myles [Wootton]?</strong><br/>
Three of us at the moment. We&#8217;ve always been moving around together. Us three [Jae, Drew and Myles] went to school together as well, so we&#8217;re talking more than half my life. I&#8217;m 29 and I was hanging out with Drew at school when we were 13 and his younger brother [Myles] caught up quickly. That creates certain bonds between a bunch of guys. You can&#8217;t fuck with it too much because you&#8217;re talking about a lot of history. There&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s gone into each point.</p>
<p><strong>And you threw yourselves into that close environment again when you went to New York to mix the album [at Woodstock Studios]. Why New York?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d been there a couple times the year before to write, walk around and have a good time &#8211; It gives you a buzz. If you can keep up with the pace, what&#8217;s going on around you, you feel like you can do great things. We didn&#8217;t have a car and the phones didn&#8217;t work, so it was just like we drove out to the hills of Perth. That was the irony of the whole thing. We got to reward ourselves by going to Manhattan and having a good one.</p>
<p><strong>Was that isolation beneficial to the creative process?</strong><br/>
Isolation is the key word of our whole career: where we come from, the places we&#8217;ve gone. How long are we going to deny ourselves and all our loved ones? [<em>Laughs</em>] It feels like half-a-year every year. Of course it always helps to tuck yourself away and work on something.</p>

<strong>And how&#8217;d you come to work with John O&#8217;Mahony?</strong><br/>
We liked the idea of working with someone younger. A lot of producers are up in their 50s, and John is 36 and his sidekick is 23, so it was like a bunch of guys in a church out in Woodstock. We had a month like that when it felt like there wasn&#8217;t anyone who wasn&#8217;t in this tight gang. </p>
<p>We went with him as well because he&#8217;s ambitious and trying to make a name for himself, but his resume was full of variety &#8211; there were a lot of hip-hop acts. He&#8217;d tell us stories about working on <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</em> album, but he also mixed some songs from Coldplay the year before. It&#8217;s nice to know that people can do the high-end stuff and then work with these left-of-centre kinda groups. We just thought whatever we threw at him, he wasn&#8217;t going to be too stuck in his ways.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing on this record seems like an afterthought.</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re getting better, after quite a few recordings, of knowing when to step back and letting others play. You listen to our first record, everyone will play through every song. These days, everyone&#8217;s cool to just go, ?I&#8217;ll see you in the middle-eight.? It&#8217;s more about people knowing what their strengths are, and putting them where it&#8217;s needed.?</p>

<p><strong>Has Myles brought a lot to the production side of things, given he&#8217;s worked on some other records [he produced Oh Mercy&#8217;s Australian Music Prize-nominated <em>Privileged Woes</em>?</strong><br/>
He&#8217;s got the recording credit, basically, for making sure everything&#8217;s miked up correctly, that sort of thing. He&#8217;s slowly gone into that role and is very passionate about it. John took the producing role. He was more like a director.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you lived in Melbourne?</strong><br/>
I think we&#8217;re pushing six years.</p>
<p><strong>Does it feel like home now?</strong><br/>
It certainly feels like home. I could see ourselves living in other places now, and I&#8217;ve been thinking about where we could set up and make another one [record]. As far as Australia goes, it seems to be our favourite place.</p>
<p><strong>Having the ability to just uproot yourself at any time does make it difficult from a personal perspective.</strong><br/>
It does, but we dedicate ourselves to the cause. Hopefully that leads to making that great record that&#8217;s been in our heads all along, which may or may not exist, but it&#8217;s certainly something we keep striving towards. We take what we do pretty seriously, and I know there&#8217;s a big future. It&#8217;s weird. I feel like it&#8217;s just the beginning. I feel like I&#8217;ve spent this last decade just learning my trade to make even better things.</p>
<p><strong>So the masterpiece is still ahead of you?</strong><br/>
Fuck yeah. [<em>Laughs</em>] We haven&#8217;t come close. I like watching the pile grow. I&#8217;m very lucky. I&#8217;ve got a great group of guys. I have ultimate faith in what&#8217;s inside this band.</p>
