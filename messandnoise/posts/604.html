                <h3>Ahead of this weekend&#8217;s Record Store Day, we asked independent record stores how they&#8217;ve fared since last year &#8211; and whether there&#8217;ll be enough of them around to sustain the event in 10 years.
</h3>
<p>Will there be a Record Store Day in five years? How about 10? When we posed these questions to 13 independent retailers across three states, we certainly didn&#8217;t expect an almost unequivocal ?yes?. Battling the digital onslaught, music piracy, online price wars and a global financial crisis, record store owners have done it tougher than most operators over the past few years &#8211; and they certainly haven&#8217;t minced words about the state of their industry when we&#8217;ve spoken to them in the past.</p>
<p>But despite the oft-reported doom and gloom, a 25 percent spike in vinyl sales has given independent record stores more than a glimmer of hope. It was enough to convince at least one store, Melbourne&#8217;s Thornbury Records, to open their doors in 2011, and it&#8217;s why the majority of stores we&#8217;ve polled go into this weekend&#8217;s Record Store Day full of optimism.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
Sure, it&#8217;s getting stronger each year.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Probably won&#8217;t be as necessary if vinyl sales keep improving at their current rate. By then every day will be indie record store day, just like &#8220;the good old days&#8221;.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
Very much so. Yours is the fourth media outlet this week to ask for my opinion on the state of the retail industry.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Surprisingly, yes. As long as it&#8217;s a sunny day Saturday, it&#8217;ll be another winner.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Not new customers that I&#8217;m aware of, just lots of regular happy customers.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Retail is up for us this past 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
A box of Coronas on ice, choice of lemon or lime &#8211; same as we&#8217;ve done every year. I&#8217;ll be spinning 45s, and at 4pm we all head down to the Tote front bar for Thee Mighty Childish plus Suitcase Royale, free entry, no excuses.</p>

<p><strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
I do. Record stores are of more cultural importance today than 15 or 20 years ago. You&#8217;re setting an example: tangible objects, all inclusive access to said objects and the community that surrounds them. Fun!</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Indeed, yes.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
I hope so. It brings attention to the fact that they still exist and that there? s a need for this particular relationship between music<br/>
and the listener: buying an LP, putting it on, staring at the cover and filling in the blanks for yourself. People still wish to relate to their music in this way, even now. It makes me happy.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
No it&#8217;s not, but that isn&#8217;t the point from what I can understand. it&#8217;s still growing.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
No more than any other day yet, but people are still becoming aware of it. In the future, I can see it being an event of consequence.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve been trundling along better than I had expected, though we&#8217;re not raking it in by any means. It&#8217;s fun. At the moment, we ask for little more than this. What else am I going to do &#8211; sit in a cubicle? I think not.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
We have an exhibition opening for visual artist Alexander James Masterson, titled <em>Accent in French</em>. There will also be musical performances by Cock Safari and Wine Sleaze. Heaps of food and grog. Good times and records blasted.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Yes.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
I think it&#8217;s serving its purpose in that it does make people visit indie record stores on the day. After being alerted to the plight of indie stores through Record Store Day, do people make more an effort to shop at indie stores all year round? I&#8217;m not so sure.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s one of our biggest sales days. People do get into the spirit of the day and make a purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
We normally see a few new faces on Record Store Day.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s been an interesting year to say the least. We virtually lost our summer trade through being all but shut down because of <a href="/news/4199464">noise issues</a>. We are, however, on the verge of overcoming our permit and noise issues but now have to face the reality of major renovations in order to keep hosting live music. Banks unfortunately aren&#8217;t rushing to lend money to record stores so we have to think of a few ways of raising the capital necessary so we can be ready for next summer. Record Store Day is a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re really happy to have Andrew Morris coming in to do a set as well as Jo Meares (without his Honeyriders &#8211; thanks neighbour!). All music in the store will be 10 percent off &#8211; and 20 percent off for Triple R and PBS subscribers.</p>

<p><strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
Yep, I refer only to the actual Record Store Day for indie stores worldwide, not the parasitic doppelganger bullshit <a href="/news/3540676">Record Store Day Australia</a> run by AMRA [The Australian Music Retailers Association]. That shouldn&#8217;t have lasted five minutes, they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;ll continue so long as people have two ears and some functioning grey matter between them.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
Certainly. It raises general awareness and serves as a reminder that if you want personalised service in your search for indie releases, hard to find/second-hand items, general advice, a place to meet people, discuss your likes, see what&#8217;s happening round town you should hit your local record store.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Support has been strong from day one. Plenty of people make the effort to hit a bunch stores and make a real day of it. Most stores have discounts, special items on offer etc., so its win-win, though it would be great if participating stores were given direct and exclusive access to the international releases.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Definitely, though we&#8217;re always gaining new customers, plenty of whom become regulars. It&#8217;s the fact we offer ?service?, as well as ?product?. You become a regular &#8211; you get looked after.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Things have been fine, we&#8217;ve concentrated on getting the best/most interesting products at the best prices available to us, swung heavily toward vinyl and away from the mainstream. Also, having <a href="/news/4036170">moved in with Missing Link</a> has helped us define who we are, though the physical move was hell.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
Ten percent off store-wide, free CD compilation with purchases (limited to 100) and the release of Lou Barlow&#8217;s <em>Live @ Missing Link</em>. Though it&#8217;s actually my day off so I&#8217;ll probably go to the pub &#8211; for some of us everyday is record store day.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
I reckon there will be. I think there will always be an interest in record stores, even if the market has changed over the years. The importance of a record store as a hub for a community of music fans remains and I guess the more record stores are marginalised, the more relevant a celebration of the love that goes in and comes out of them becomes.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Well, a real positive function of having this day for us has been to demonstrate the co-operative spirit that the local and interstate independent stores share. For example, the <a href="http://digginmelbourne.wordpress.com/">Diggin&#8217; Melbourne</a> map of record stores in Melbourne that came out last year. That spirit is there all year around, but it&#8217;s nice to have a excuse to really band together once a year, and I think in this way some kind of Record Store Day can always exist in Australia &#8211; even if it&#8217;s our own homespun version.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
I think it does. People do genuinely get excited about shopping for hard copy items on the day, which is awesome, and that must have a residual effect on people&#8217;s shopping habits. And I guess getting people excited about buying hard copy music from a record store is the purpose of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s cool. Last year there was a real nice feeling in the store &#8211; a general air of excitement &#8211; and yeah, people bought a lot of stuff, which was really nice.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Last year it was great. There were all the familiar faces hanging out on a Saturday (usually reserved for ?Friday Madness?!), but heaps of new ones too. Hard to tell if they came back again &#8211; so many faces on the day, and such a wide spread of people in all the time. But it certainly is exciting to see so many people digging around all at once. Hard to get any work done.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
I think the past year has been pretty positive for the store, we&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into the presentation of the shop, as well as stocking heaps of cool local stuff, and as much interesting overseas releases from bands with more tricky distribution, which I think keeps the store really interesting and exciting. Keeping our prices low and fair in such strange times has been another really positive aspect of the past year, though I don&#8217;t know if any of this has much of a correlation to Record Store Day.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
Since the shop has become so jam-packed with music in the past year, we have no room for bands in-store at the minute which is a real shame. (We&#8217;re working on this, and new storage space makes it a real possibility!). But on the flip side, we are releasing an amazing Lou Barlow hour-long cassette, recorded live in the store in March last year on the Missing Link label, which is really exciting. We also have the new Golden Staph LP, Lakes? <em>Winters Blade</em> LP, the new Circle Pit 7&#8243; on Hardly Art (and a few copies of the hand-drawn Circle Pit 7&#8243;) and a CD-R compilation of Australian music (limited edition of 100) all released on Saturday. On top of that, we&#8217;re having 10 percent off everything in the shop.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
For sure! From what started so humbly only a few years ago to have already become a date that people mark in their calendars and save up their hard-earned cash for, it can only get bigger and better. As long as there are still record stores, let&#8217;s hope that there will always still be a RSD [Record Store Day].</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
By then I&#8217;m hoping it will be an internationally-recognised public holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think it&#8217;s serving its purpose?</strong><br/>
By and large, yes. There are always frustrations with its very nature: releases are strictly limited-edition and American stores always get first pick of those (which is completely understandable). So Australian shoppers need to realise that there simply isn&#8217;t going to be enough of every title to go around.</p>
<p>Folks also need to realise the &#8220;happening&#8221; that Record Store Day is meant to be. Come into the store on Record Store Day! It&#8217;s a once-a-year in-person special event, and is not meant to serve online shoppers or people who want to pre-order 20 copies of something. Also, it would be great if Australian labels could work towards doing more/any releases. I can&#8217;t see why a local band couldn&#8217;t press up a 7&#8243; to sell first on Record Store Day, and then if there were copies left over they could always sell the remainders as merch on tour at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s definitely grown to that, yes. Last year was almost double what we&#8217;d do on a normal Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Yeah, people do get excited about getting their hands on a release they wouldn&#8217;t be able to otherwise. It&#8217;s been great having bands like Radiohead and Foo Fighters do their respective RSD releases this year, it goes to show that you&#8217;re never too &#8220;big&#8221; to have a special, limited-edition title. And it implants that special nature of buying records into their fans&#8217; minds, who hopefully keep coming back.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re still here!</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got 10 percent off all in-stock vinyl (excluding lay-bys and customer orders) on Saturday across both our stores. Plus we&#8217;ve got a dazzling array of Record Store Day releases to sell. These will be in our King Street store only. We&#8217;ll be announcing some of them on our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/redeyerecords">Twitter feed</a> throughout the day on Friday. But the best thing to do is set your alarm clock early on Saturday morning and come down. You won&#8217;t be disappointed. And, hey, if you do miss out on that one particular RSD release, we&#8217;ve got a huge shop full of other stuff you might have missed ordinarily.</p>

<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Again, hopefully not.</p>
<p><strong>Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think it&#8217;s serving its purpose?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s stated purpose, absolutely not. Its intended purpose (more elitism and bullshit), no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Not by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Nup.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
It was completely and utterly inconsequential, as every year.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
Black Wire will be closed all day in protest at the &#8220;industry&#8221; attempts to pay lip service to record shops for one pathetic day while either fucking them over or ignoring them the rest of the year. Also just to be dicks. Steal digital, buy vinyl. Go to shows.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years? 10?</strong><br/>
Unless it evolves into Record Store Week or Month, then yes. It may not be the same stores being celebrated then as now, but new stores will emerge (physical and virtual) to cater to niche markets. While music has become easier and easier to access through digital means (exposing more music to a broader audience), we are currently witnessing a renegotiation of the role that physical music products play in our society. There is a definite nostalgia that vinyl records evoke for a generation which has just begun to really discover them. Perhaps this is a fashion trend more broadly &#8211; vintage clothes, hand-written letters, a belief in romance and a collection of vinyl records. But perhaps this is the role that vinyl is meant to play? It reminds us of the physicality of music, of the fact that it is real and can be held, felt, collected and passed onto others.</p>
<p><strong>Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think it&#8217;s serving its purpose?</strong><br/>
While it&#8217;s early days for Record Store Day in Australia, the sheer number of artists that have rallied behind the cause and released special edition products for Record Store Day in 2011 proves that the day has gained a lot of momentum and is taken seriously by the music industry worldwide. The fact that there is a large amount of press coverage this year also means that the day is serving its purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re a brand new store, but we hope so.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
Ten percent off all full priced vinyl; free stuff every hour; limited edition rock photography by Kate Griffin; special record Store Day releases; and free quotes on turntable repairs and servicing.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
Yes, I believe there will be.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Possibly. Although it&#8217;s so popular now that it could be in danger of losing its charm. There are so many releases coming out and so much demand for them, it makes it hard to keep up with it all and impossible for smaller shops to stock them all.</p>
<p><strong>Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think it&#8217;s serving its purpose?</strong><br/>
Definitely. It gets people going to your local independent record store where they originally might not have. It gives indie stores to get one over the chain stores with some of the releases made available to them. It also gives the record store a good excuse to do something a bit different &#8211; whether an in-store performance, or specials of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Christmas is our biggest sale day of the year, and it&#8217;s hard to say for us because we have only been open for one Record Store Day. However, given the reaction we&#8217;ve been getting, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a good day for sales.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We opened the store on the actual day and it was recognised locally because of this. The store has been going really well since.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
We opened on Record Store Day 2010, so it&#8217;ll be our one-year birthday on Sunday. On Saturday, we&#8217;ll be having 20 percent off all CDs and vinyl; and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll have an in-store from some local artists, as well as a vegan bake-sale.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
With the excitement and sales in vinyl going up, most certainly!</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d say, yes.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
Yes, this year in particular. It&#8217;s bringing many more new customers into our store and even turning people onto turntables.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
Yep, and the last two years we haven&#8217;t even promoted it at all. This year we are anticipating a huge day.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s bringing new customers, but not all are returning, hopefully with a packed store this year people will be impressed and want to return.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve had a fantastic past six months and an overall good year to date. Fifteen years and going strong.</p>
<p>**What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this year?<br/>
We are offering 10 percent off storewide (including RSD releases); 50 percent off all CD and vinyl bargain bin stock; free customer BBQ; and many exclusive RSD releases.</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;ll be Repressed Records Day worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;ll have morphed into Outdoor Retail Store Day, where obese people carrying umbrellas and a GPS do an annual march to the nearest High Street shopping precinct, which is now just a TAB Barbershop, to place a bet and get a haircut. It will be on Melbourne Cup Day for added convenience.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
I was bit weird about it at first and thought it&#8217;s a bit of a sympathy day really that offers nothing long term. But as a small business, I now look at it as an advertising opportunity. We have limited resources, and can&#8217;t afford full-page spreads in <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> every week.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s OK. We haven&#8217;t really put this much effort in before. Hopefully this weekend will be a ripper.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s hard to say, but we&#8217;ve definitely had a lot of interest so far this week about releases coming in.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s OK. Still married, in business and have a house. Faring better than <a href="/discussions/4236601">Altiyan Childs</a> by the looks of it.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this year?</strong><br/>
Some exclusive stuff like the OFF! ?Live At Generation Records? 7&#8243; and a Lou Barlow <em>Live @ Missing Link</em> cassette from our mates down in Melbourne. Australian-wise, RIP Society is releasing its Golden Staph LP; the Lakes LP will be here; and we&#8217;ll have about 10 Circle Pit 7&#8243;s with hand-drawn sleeves from Angie and Jack. We&#8217;ve got some Repressed Records carry bags to give away with LP purchases, a Cosmic Psychos <a href="/releases/2000853">double CD</a> will be out as will the new Panda Bear and Bill Callahan vinyl. Plus some Jesus Lizard and Elliott Smith 7&#8243;s and a $2 second-hand vinyl clear out. Plus just in, the new Fucked Up LP and Fleet Foxes and Black Angels Record Store Day-only releases. We were going to do a BBQ, but that&#8217;s a bit suckie.</p>

Absolutely! I think it&#8217;ll be a week-long festival where we dance on the<br/>
grave of chain stores.</p>
<p><strong>How about 10?</strong><br/>
Yep, in 10 years we&#8217;ll be burying the internet (sorry <em>M+N</em>).</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
I do. I think it&#8217;s improving every year too. I think most people would be excited with a day a year to celebrate something that&#8217;s small and important to them.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a really big day for us and we&#8217;re expecting it to be bigger this year with the amount of exclusive Record Store Day releases that we&#8217;ve had access to. It&#8217;s the age-old rule of what makes an independent record store busy and that is if there are good records out, people will come in and buy them.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve noticed huge amounts of new people coming in but there are definitely bigger smiles on our regulars? faces.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Things have been good. There&#8217;s been a change in ownership for<br/>
Starters, but Simon and I are feeling pretty good about the shops. </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this year?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re having a 15 percent off sale on all CDs, vinyl, DVDs and books. In the city store we have some bands coming in to play: Oscar + Martin (3pm), Mick Turner (4pm) and Eat Skull (5pm), and in the Fitzroy store we have the return of our favourite &#8220;work experience&#8221; dudes: RRR Breakfasters (11am-12pm); Alan Brough (12pm-1pm); Daniel Kitson (1pm-2pm); and Josh Earl, Andrew McClelland and Lawrence Leung (2pm-3pm).</p>

<strong>Reckon there&#8217;ll be a Record Store Day in five years? How about 10?</strong><br/>
Yes, Record Store Day will be going in five and 10 years time.</p>
<p>**Record Store Day has been running for four years now. Do you think<br/>
it&#8217;s serving its purpose?**<br/>
It&#8217;s definitely serving its purpose. It&#8217;s been a massive worldwide success. Everyone has heard of it and even major rock stars are supporting it: Chuck Berry, The Rolling Stones, Dylan, Paul McCartney, Tom Waits. It&#8217;s raised massive awareness as to the plight of indie record stores and anyone who is in love with music obviously has a love for indie record stores.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a big driver of sales?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a big driver of sales on the day and it has trickled on throughout the year, in that more and more people realise it sucks in a major way to illegally download. It&#8217;s become important to a small but growing group of people. Record stores need to be supported otherwise there will be none.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bringing new customers into the store? And do they return after?</strong><br/>
Yes, it&#8217;s helped us get new customers.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s your store fared since the last Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
This year has been very very tough. Rising rents are a massive killer. Already Melbourne has lost: Last Record Store, Second Spin, some Dixons branches, Hound Dogs Bop Shop is closing and Missing Link is <a href="/news/4215621">up for sale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s planned for Record Store Day this weekend?</strong><br/>
A massive sale: 20 percent minimum off everything except vinyl, which is 10 percent off.</p>
