                <h3>In his keynote address at the Australian Music Prize in Sydney on March 8, &#8216;Rolling Stone&#8217; US senior editor David Fricke reveals how he found his thrill for Australian rock&#8217;n?roll on Strawberry Hill(s). Transcribed by <strong>HUGH ROBERTSON</strong>, reprinted by express permission of The AMP.
</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows I&#8217;m a hardcore New Yorker. I love the idea that I can jump on the subway a block from my apartment, get off at 34th Street, ride the escalator up to Madison Square Garden and then see U2 and Bruce Springsteen blow the roof off the place. </p>
<p>But this does feel like homecoming to me, because I&#8217;ve had some of the best times of my rock&#8217;n?roll life in Australia. I&#8217;ve made several trips here for work and vacation since my first visit in 1983, when I went crazy for Midnight Oil, The Church, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Shirl and Greg from Skyhooks, Mental As Anything and, of course, The Celibate Rifles for a cover story for <em>Musician Magazine</em> &#8211; I believe the first time they were on the cover of an American magazine. I&#8217;m very proud of that, actually.</p>
<p>And then there was the bang-up week I had in 1995 when I wrote about R.E.M.?s first shows on their <em>Monster</em> tour, which had the added benefit of Died Pretty as an opening act, and I spent my first Big Day Out in Sydney getting a loud fill of silverchair, Magic Dirt, Spiderbait, You Am I and the legendary Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman, with Kent Steedman on guitar. And I&#8217;ve had some of my best Australian good times at home, too, when the music came to me. There was the day I spent in a New York studio with INXS just before they were about to record ?Original Sin? with Nile Rodgers; I went out with silverchair on their first American tour, and watched them mow down a sold-out crowd in a Detroit church hall, and then they mooned the fans from the tour bus window afterwards.</p>
<p>And my reward for writing about those shenanigans with such deep envy was that I got asked down to a B-sides session they were doing in New York, when they recorded Radio Birdman&#8217;s ?New Race? with Deniz Tek, and I got to do the ?yeahs? around a couple of mics with Daniel [Johns], Chris [Joannou], Ben [Gillies] and Deniz. And I can say, with good authority, that I am the only American rock critic who sings (kind of) on the B-side of a #1 Australian single. You can also tell by now that I am a major fan of Radio Birdman. Everybody should be.</p>

<p/>
<p>Other high points? The unforgettable week of club shows that The Oils played in New York in 1998 at the Mercury Lounge, packing that frenzy on to a postage stamp-sized stage, and there was a revelation actually, just a couple of months ago, when my goddaughter from Adelaide sent me a couple of Aussie CDs as  a Christmas present. Now, usually, nobody buys me records because they think I&#8217;ve got everything, but here&#8217;s a hot tip &#8211; I don&#8217;t. But one of them was The Jezabels? album <a href="/releases/2000936"><em>[Prisoner</a>*], a record that I loved so much that I immediately commissioned myself to review it for *Rolling Stone* in America. The other record she sent was *<a href="/releases/2000918">Moonfire</a></em> by Boy &amp; Bear &#8211; another AMP nominee and a big winner at the recent ARIAs. My goddaughter has fabulous taste.</p>
<p>The truth is, I&#8217;m always here &#8211; even when I&#8217;m not. And I was ready long before I showed up here. My life with Australian music started with ?Friday On My Mind? by The Easybeats. Now, I&#8217;m showing my age, but frankly I don&#8217;t care. It was a great time to be glued to a radio, and that record was one brilliant reason. I don&#8217;t recall if the jocks of the day even mentioned that the guys were from Australia, but it was easy to hear that this was a different rock&#8217;n?roll, and something that was new to me, from somewhere new to me. The guitars were hotter &#8211; if you remember the record they had this brittle, chiming treble that was very different to The Beatles and The Stones. There was also a really aggressive sheen to the harmonies, as if they were capturing that thing from The Crawdaddy Club, but with The Everly Brothers. It was really special and beautiful. And I loved the white soul force, and the sound of Stevie Wright&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that they were all immigrant Aussies, from England, Scotland and The Netherlands. But you didn&#8217;t need to know any of that, because they were special. And they were from somewhere with their own revolutions in sound, social convention and teenage attitude. You should know that my reaction was in good company. There is a famous story &#8211; and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s apocryphal &#8211; about Paul McCartney, who was driving in his car when the BBC played what was then a new Easybeats? single, ?Gonna Have A Good Time?, and he was so knocked out that he pulled over at the next phone booth, called and asked them to play it again. He was a Beatle, so they did.</p>

<p/>
<p>A lot of my early <em>Rolling Stone</em> pieces on Australian bands in the late-?70s and early-?80s were about how hard it was for them to crack North America. The Angels had to change their name to Angel City and then had to wonder why they were playing Chicago three times in six months. They also got dumped as an opening act for The Kinks because they were too good. Ray Davies is a really paranoid guy. And on Men At Work&#8217;s first American tour, one of the guys &#8211; I think it was Colin Hay, told me that he had tried to place a call back home &#8211; and this is before cell phones and Skype, so he had to use an operator who was apparently from Kansas or South Dakota, and she had a lot of trouble with his accent, so she tried to put him through to Austria.</p>
<p>And there was a phoner I did in 1982 with Don Walker of Cold Chisel. He admitted that the distance between Australia and America wasn&#8217;t just the 6000 miles of water. He said, ?When you come from a place as removed from the roots of rock&#8217;n?roll as Australia, you have this suspicion at the back of your mind that you might have missed the point somewhere. Are we really doing it right?? And I&#8217;m thinking, this is the guy who wrote ?Khe Sahn? and ?Star Hotel?, and the last thing I associate with Australian is an inferiority complex.</p>
<p>I was fascinated, too, by the way many of the Australians I met defined rock stardom: not as celebrity, or even as income, but as a measure of achievement. INXS toured the US like crazy for more than half a decade, slowly working their way up the bill and in bigger and bigger venues, until they were ripe and ready for Madison Square Garden &#8211; something you can see on the live DVD they released. I was at that gig, and it&#8217;s exactly what was on that DVD. But they came from Perth, and they knew a lot about what it was like to go long distances &#8211; like the time one of the Fariss brothers told me about the time they set off from Perth for a gig in remote Western Australia, and discovered at one point that their van had, literally, run out of road. No paving. They kept going, they made the gig. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s done here. </p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vv7w69bdCBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>There was a personal touch, too, an openness and curiosity, laced with a blunt realism about Australia musicians that appealed to me. I will always treasure the night that Michael Hutchence accepted an invitation from my wife and myself to get out of his New York hotel room while INXS were in town, and come up to our apartment for a drink and a chat. He showed up &#8211; he also got lost on the way, but that&#8217;s a story for the bar later on, if I haven&#8217;t told it to you already.</p>
<p>There was the thanksgiving that Paul Kelly and my good friend Stuart Coupe sat in our apartment, pawing over this US atlas, planning a car trip like a couple of Hank Williams?. The trip apparently involved New Orleans and long stretches of West Texas &#8211; places I&#8217;ve never been. </p>
<p>And there was the time I met the guys from silverchair for the first time, and the way they acted was before that set, that manic set they played at the Big Day Out in 1995. They sat on the floor in some non-descript hallway, unimpressed, and barely looked up. They didn&#8217;t even look at me, this big American rock critic geek with glasses, real tight with the managers and the label. BFD [big fucking deal]. It was really refreshing. They also got over it later, and we got on famously.</p>
<p>I also like the way you define rock&#8217;n?roll struggle. On that first trip here in 1983 I saw The Oils play a dynamite, classic-era gig at the town hall in Adelaide. And I had coffee with the band before the show, and Peter [Garrett] was trying to describe to me a typical evening for them in the early years in the western suburbs in Sydney. ?Halfway through out set,? he said with that intensity that I think we all know so well, ?two large, drunk truck drivers decide to have a fight. They were beating each other up and careening toward the corner where the band was set up. Meanwhile, everyone else is going, ?Turn it down &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to watch TV?.? Peter looks up at me with that look. ?Try to contemplate that,? he said, ?as an environment in which to play music every night for three years.?</p>
<p>The funny thing was that I had that exact same experience just a couple of nights later. I wasn&#8217;t on stage, but I was in the thick of it. I had gone to the Strawberry Hills Hotel, which I&#8217;m glad to see is still standing, to see your X with the great <a href="/articles/4286629">Ian Rilen</a> of Rose Tattoo. And during this set, I step out to make a phone call on this big, red thing that looks like a fire hydrant. And while I&#8217;m standing there on the blower, the two bartenders behind the bar start brawling &#8211; they&#8217;re cursing, they&#8217;re throwing punches. And the old time guys sitting at the bar are all like, ?Business as usual, so what?? The fight spills over the bar, to where I&#8217;m standing, and at one point one of the bartenders throws the other guy out in the street. And meanwhile, X are still playing in the back room, and they&#8217;re doing that hard-ass take they do of ?Mother? from John Lennon&#8217;s <em>Plastic Ono Band</em> album. And I was like, ?Thank you guys! This is fantastic! I love it, and I recognise it.? It&#8217;s like a great night at CBGBs, except it&#8217;s got better accents, better mayhem, and the music is killing. I thought, ?Man, it does not get any better than this.? But, in fact, it has. Over and over again.</p>

<p>Just on that first trip I got to watch The Celibate Rifles rehearse in a tiny wood shed out in Frenchs Forest &#8211; it was like a scene out of <em>Deliverance</em>. And I saw Hunters &amp; Collectors play ?Talking To A Stranger? at the Sydney Trade Union Club. And when I got the press release announcing the nominees for The AMP this year I had a very warm flashback when I saw that one of the record was a solo album by Adalita, the singer/guitarist for Magic Dirt. Because after I saw them scorching the air with feedback at the Big Day Out I had the great fortune to catch another gig at a surf station in Bondi beach. They played on the floor of what was basically a concrete bunker &#8211; there was no air-conditioning, and anyone who couldn&#8217;t get in to that small, packed room just hung through the open windows. It was the kind of night that reminds me: I have got the best job in the world.</p>
<p>Now there are great gigs everywhere &#8211; there&#8217;s something happening every night, somewhere. A special band, working hard to cut through the muck and the plastic in their town or country. But there is an energy, and an urgency, a drive to be heard &#8211; not just succeed &#8211; that I believe is unique to Australia and the music you make here. I recognised it right away on records, and as soon as I got here. And listening to this years? AMP candidates, like Adalita, The Jezabels, The Middle East, Jack Ladder &amp; The Dreamlanders, and the great Aboriginal singer and writer Gurrumul &#8211; I hope I pronounced that right &#8211; that is still present and alive. I&#8217;ve had so many good times with Aussie music, and now I&#8217;m in another.</p>
<p>A common theme that came up in a lot of my interviews and bar talks with Australian bands in the late-?70s and early-?80s was how geography can work in your favour, and not just against. You were well placed for invention, hungry for, and connected to, British and American rock and pop influences, but far enough away to be forced &#8211; and more importantly, free &#8211; to make up your own versions. We had the Detroit fury and anarchy of The MC5 and The Stooges, but you had Radio Birdman, because Deniz Tek brought the original stuff here, personally, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then he and Rob Younger and those guys threw in some Jan &amp; Dean, and Blue Oyster Cult. </p>
<p>You also had a New Wave that had a lot more hardcore R&amp;B to it, and songwriting imagination. Bands like The Sports, and Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons. And you know you&#8217;re bringing something strong when Elvis Costello records your material, as he did with Jo Jo Zep&#8217;s ?So Young?. And just when the British thought they had post-punk angst sewn up with Joy Division and The Cure, The Birthday Party showed up with the real, poetic violence and the deep, twisted blues. They quickly separate the men from the moaners.</p>

<p/>
<p>Now, isolation and that ?show me? arrogance those bands got when they first went across was a huge pain in the ass. But it is also a great instigator. Shirl from Skyhooks boasted to me, kind of, about the US shows that they played in the ?70s, opening for Journey as he put it, ?before they got big?. That&#8217;s an insult, actually.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s like a great night at CBGBs, except it&#8217;s got better accents, better mayhem, and the music is killing.?</p></blockquote>
<p>When AC/DC were having their way with America on the <em>Back In Black</em> tour, Angus and Malcolm Young enjoyed telling me stories about what they call, ?Doing a Starsky &amp; Hutch?, which was plowing their rental car through the backstage gate to get into the gig. Apparently they would show up backstage at some arena for these gigs and then get shoved off by security, who couldn&#8217;t believe such tiny guys with molasses accents could even carry guitars, much less be in one of the bands playing that night. How wrong they were. Because the bands that AC/DC toured with knew a lot different. Joe Perry once told me that, watching Angus from the wings when AC/DC were opening for Aerosmith in the ?70s, he said, ?For all that gymnastic stuff, Angus never missed a note.? Perry also told me that the Aerosmith crew had a nickname for that moment in the set when Angus fell on his back and started pumping his legs in the air while he was playing &#8211; they called it ?bacon frying?. Road crews have the best language, man. I have nothing on them. </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve talked a lot of history here &#8211; partly because I love it, especially the rock and roll kind. For me, it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s also exploration, and education. Actually, yesterday, I was at TITLE Records, which I guess is in Surry Hills, and I got the Ron Peno solo record <em><a href="/releases/2000920">Future Universe</a>*; I got this Eddy Current Suppression Ring compilation <a href="/releases/2000960">*[So Many Things</a>*]; I also got a <a href="/releases/2000679">live album</a> by the band Tully, recorded in 1969-70; I got the *Morning Of The Earth* soundtrack, which I&#8217;ve never heard; and I got this record, I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s not great, *<a href="/releases/2000798">Artefacts of Australian Experimental Music, 1930-1973</a></em>. One of the tracks is by the Melbourne Dada Group, with Barry Humphries, recorded in 1952. That has got to be some kind of hip. I&#8217;m really excited.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m a reporter &#8211; there&#8217;s no such thing as too much information. But for you, the history is a standard of creation and conviction that you take abroad. It&#8217;s what you have to live up to, but also what you get to live up to. It&#8217;s why there&#8217;s an AMP, it&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here in this room, and why we&#8217;re recognising a great year in Aussie music, but more importantly we&#8217;re recognising an independent spirit. </p>
<h2>?It&#8217;s the Wild West out there?</h2>
<p>Now, the temptations and choices that bands and artists have now are greater, but they are a lot more perilous too. What to license, who do you license it to? If you can&#8217;t get it on the radio, how do you get your music out there? Is advertising the best bet? I&#8217;m glad Iggy Pop got paid for licensing ?Lust For Life? to Carnival Cruises. The notion of people dancing around the pool, singing, ?It&#8217;s just like hypnotising chickens?, is a wonderful irony. But it&#8217;s also easy to confuse income, promotion and the true worth of what you do, your actual ownership of what you&#8217;ve created. When Bob Seger performs ?Like A Rock? in concert, it&#8217;s his song, but Chevrolet pretty much own everything but the notes. Ironically, when I did see The Who on that farewell tour at Shea Stadium in 1982, one of the opening acts was The Clash. And they didn&#8217;t last long after that.</p>
<p>Yes, I am talking a lot about history. I could stand up here for days, just listing all of the Australian bands, songs and albums, stuffed with everything else in my New York apartment. There are records that knocked me sideways when I first heard them, and they still do it for me now. I will name just a few more: ?Cattle and Cane? by The Go-Betweens; ?Mirror Blues? by The Died Pretty (you really need the 12?, it&#8217;s no fun flipping the 7? over); The Church&#8217;s second album, <em>Blurred Crusade*. ?When You Were Mine? is brilliant stuff. *The Loved Ones</em> by The Loved Ones, one of the weirdest and finest garage rock records ever made. Everything by the hypnotic jazz trio The Necks, and then Stevie Wright&#8217;s mini-opera ?Evie? &#8211; all 11 minutes of it are so good that I have two copies of the original album, both Australian and American editions, which have different covers.</p>

<p/>
<p>And there was the night I was introduced to the quietly searing songcraft of Archie Roach, at a club in the northern beaches where I heard Paul Kelly sing Roach&#8217;s harrowing ballad ?Took The Children Away? for the first time. You could hear a pin drop in that place &#8211; no small achievement in that place. The action at the bar literally seemed to freeze. It was a moment of cutting beauty and a lesson in an instant, not just or me but for everyone in that room, about a terrible, lingering stain on your nation&#8217;s history and pride. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reflected a lot on these records and my experience with your music as I tried to figure out what to say today about the future, not just of your music but of all the music that matters to me. And there&#8217;s a lot of it. I say this often, and I swear it&#8217;s true: it&#8217;s the Wild West out there. The future is written one minute, then immediately unwritten the next. There&#8217;s turbulence in commerce, ideals, and rapidly changing technology. And I&#8217;m not sure ?evolving? is quite the right word yet. It can be compelling as the Jazz Age, and it can be as compelling as a car crash. Social media may be the great equaliser, but when everything is equal, does anything stand out? When anything is available, is anything treasured?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m not the best guy to talk about Facebook, Twitter and the cloud &#8211; my friends know this, because a) I&#8217;m not on Facebook; b) I don&#8217;t have a cell phone; and Twitter would never work for me. I can&#8217;t write anything with just 140 characters. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m also very proprietary about my record collection. It&#8217;s a physical presence in my life. And as an artifact and as a mark of what I&#8217;ve done and where I&#8217;ve been, the idea of storing it all in some fizzy mass over some Apple bunker in Georgia, it just sounds like I&#8217;m paying additional rent for something I&#8217;ve already paid for dearly and happily. I love my iPod for travelling, and I swear by my iPad for writing on the road &#8211; I wrote most of this on my iPad, and I was up until 4am reviewing New Order last night, which will explain why I&#8217;m probably jabbering here. Actually, it was a pretty good gig, but there was a big hole where Peter Hook was supposed to be. But that&#8217;s a speech I&#8217;ll be giving in Manchester.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve always defined the word ?friend? differently than MySpace ever did. And I&#8217;m sorry, but whenever someone says the word ?Skype?, it sounds like someone mispronouncing the name of R.E.M.?s singer. The upside? You are better connected to the world. I can listen to Aussie radio on my computer, and even Cold Chisel is finally up on iTunes. Although AC/DC still aren&#8217;t interested. When I asked Malcolm Young about why they refused to put their catalogue on iTunes he didn&#8217;t exactly answer the question, he mostly snorted with contempt. Which I thought was a pretty Australian response, actually.</p>
<p>The thing is, all of that stuff &#8211; apps, hits, page views, downloads, this whole new language that we used to describe this thing, and we don&#8217;t even know what it is yet &#8211; that is not ?music?, it&#8217;s distribution. It&#8217;s a means to an end, it&#8217;s not the point of departure. It is easier to do this stuff, to take the music in to your own hands, to get that music that&#8217;s up in your head out in to the world. Record it on your laptop, share it and sell it on the web. And it works. It&#8217;s worth noting that most of the albums nominated for the AMP this year are independent releases. Previous indie winners include Eddy Current Suppression Ring in 2008, and The Drones in the inaugural year of 2005. They are both killer records, both by top rock bands, and they did it themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>?When anything is available, is anything treasured??</p></blockquote>
<p>But it&#8217;s also harder to do this rock&#8217;n?roll thing because independence comes at a very high price &#8211; you have to do everything yourself, and that time you&#8217;re forced to spend on everything other than the music is large, and it&#8217;s draining, and it&#8217;s not as fulfilling as the music. Also, the competition is stiffer. I know because at <em>Rolling Stone</em> I open all my own mail, and there&#8217;s a lot of it. Anyone who can make a record does. And from what I understand the <a href="http://themusic.com.au/theamp/entrants/">list of records</a> just in contention for the AMP this year was the longest in its history. That&#8217;s a powerful statement about the music, and the quality of the music, that&#8217;s happening right here and now. It is also a hell of a lot of music, and a lot of judgment to make. I think the AMP folks &#8211; patrons, judges, everyone involved in this deserves a round of applause right here and now, because I know how hard that work is.</p>
<p>Now, I have talked a lot about my past with your music, and it&#8217;s a history I got to be a part of in my own small way. But that history is a big reason why we&#8217;re here today, celebrating a great year in Australian music. Because that history has taught you that the average is not acceptable. And if you&#8217;re going to take your show on the road, out to the world, you have to be the thing that we need. It&#8217;s gotta be the thing that we don&#8217;t have already. And people here ask me all the time, why do I like Australian music so much? Well, that night at the Strawberry Hills has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>But what makes it unique? I can answer that with something else that Peter Garrett told me in a 1990 interview, when I was down here interviewing the band for <em>Blue Sky Mining</em>. ?If The Oils should be seen in any particular bright light,? he said, ?They should be seen as an apparition that can work, that there&#8217;s room for the rogue angels.? At your best, and especially in your music, you are a nation of rogue angels. And for that, I truly say, ?Thank you.? </p>
