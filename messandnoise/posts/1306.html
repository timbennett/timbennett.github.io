                <h3>Fifteen years after the death of leader William Arthur, Sydney band Glide are still reverberating through people&#8217;s lives. Ahead of a tribute concert in Melbourne, various members, friends, and fans of the band revisit their favourite Glide songs.

<h2>?Line?  </h2>
<p><strong>Paul McDonald (early Glide member):</strong> ?Line? was a song written demoed and fully formed by William on that well-worn four-track tape machine of his. Upon my first day of joining the band, I was given a cassette with a note on it: ?Learn these, your part is in the right-hand channel.? OK then, and so I did. It also contained ?Something?, ?Your Time?, ?Always Fall? [and] ?A Dream? on it. ?Line? contained William&#8217;s lyrical mix of classic movie references, not-so-thinly-veiled drug references and a lot of other boy/girl melodrama that made some of his best songs.</p>
<p>The clip to this song is one of the very few official clips the band filmed, as clips were very expensive in those days &#8211; the technology wasn&#8217;t as freely available as it is today. It was a bittersweet memory seeing this appear on YouTube a while back, as I had never seen the finished product. It was filmed the day after my brother&#8217;s funeral, so almost 20 years to the day. Hair was long and shirts were colourful in those days and we had a good day making this clip at the ABC studios and in a band that didn&#8217;t talk of such things as emotions, all of the lads were very good and kind to me that day, coming off the end of a pretty terrible few weeks. It was such a relief to be back doing music and hanging out with friends, away from the melodrama of real life.</p>

<h2>?Picking at Your Paws?  </h2>
<p><strong>Paul McDonald:</strong> ?Picking at Your Paws? was a last-minute addition to the album, from a chord sequence that William had been messing with, and it may have been four-tracked but by that stage William only ever wrote one guitar part, allowing me to have the freedom to do what I did on guitar. As soon as I heard it I jumped on it; I knew how great and powerful a song it was. I&#8217;m pretty sure William or the band thought it was too goth, which was the ultimate insult within Glide. I loved it. I remember building up walls of guitars and riffs with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Connolly">Wayne Connolly</a> and being in guitar heaven, adding the riffs and guitar solos with William watching on in amusement at the volume and sheer brutality of his once delicate song.</p>
<p>After wrapping up the guitar parts and thinking I was pretty damn clever that day, William then laid down his vocal and shut me up pretty quick. Those lyrics and the delivery are some of the heaviest, most poignant I have heard from any artist and it still sends shivers. What a way to end an album.</p>

<h2>?Waterfall?  </h2>
<p><strong>Jamie Hutchings (Bluebottle Kiss, Infinity Broke):</strong> Mellifluous. It&#8217;s a lovely sounding word, and one ?of ?the ?rare ?ones ?that ?sounds ?as ?it should. It&#8217;s the perfect word to describe William&#8217;s guitar playing and singing. Honeyed I guess, without being sickly. I wasn&#8217;t much of a fan of the monosyllabic band names that were doing the rounds at this time, but in hindsight the name Glide as a band name for this group was a great fit. They were ahead of their time in the sense that a wave of Australian bands in the late ?90s tastefully borrowed from them well. That open, breathy summery sound became more familiar.</p>
<p>?Waterfall? is arguably their greatest song. I remember playing it with the remaining members of Glide, around six months after William passed away, at his memorial show at what used to be called Goldman&#8217;s in Newtown. I was playing through Wayne Connolly&#8217;s beautiful Fender Tonemaster amplifier (the same model William used) and again it struck me that the title ?Waterfall? was the perfect moniker for this tune. Cascading sheets of harmonically overdriven? guitar. It kind of stretches and pulls you without tearing you completely apart; it&#8217;s truly special. ?So close I drift and fall under your wheel.? I&#8217;d heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=N16mAO-GVeI">?Thin Faced Man?</a> a few times from the EP before this, but it was the song that made me part with my cash. I still get a rush whenever I hear&#8217;it.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Surfaced? Euphoric?  </h2>
<p><strong>Jamie Hutchings:</strong> One of my favourites. It&#8217;s from their second album, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/disappear-here/id383873987">Disappear Here</a></em>, which is a very natural sounding album. A lot of the delays and reverbs had gone and the band had stripped back to a three-piece and I think its lack of adornment works really well. William is a fantastic guitar player; everything he played had a certain harmonic beauty to it, but often with an underlying floor of dissonance. It set them apart from a lot of the other groups at the time.</p>
<p>A lot of Glide&#8217;s best songs feel aquatic to me. ?Dive down and surface euphoric.? This one makes me think of the beautiful sensation you get when you&#8217;re on the floor of the ocean looking up at the surface and seeing the dappled sunlight filter through. Rather than the chorus being the big lift, it drops right down over a subtle military-style snare roll, a really pretty guitar refrain and William&#8217;s vocal. ?In my narrow way I know whee I&#8217;m going.? What a talented guy. I&#8217;m glad people are still playing and listening to Glide&#8217;s music.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?What Do I Know?  </h2>
<p><strong>Joe Ryall (Glide manager):</strong> In the summer of 1995, over a period of three weeks, Glide recorded and mixed 16 tracks at the luxurious Q Studios in Surry Hills. The suite had been made famous by INXS and the next act in after Glide would be another three-piece, You Am I &#8211; about to record <em>Hourly Daily</em>. Everybody associated with the band had a different view about which of the 16 were the strongest and about which should be the lead single. ?Tangled?, ?To Your Side?, Here She Comes? and ?Surfaced Euphoric? were all given consideration, but in the end the sheer adrenaline rush of ?What Do I Know??, coupled with its darker lyrical undertones (?Just one little taste takes away 10 years??), was felt to be just too good to resist. William had a wonderful ability to talk to us both as individuals and as a group simultaneously. ?Why do you have to be so loyal?? he asks us all accusingly.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Worlds Away?  </h2>
<p><strong>Joe Ryall:</strong> This song beautifully shows the gentleness that William had in his spirit. The two guitar tracks intermingle seamlessly (Tim Whitten delightfully produced) with the high-speed strumming adding a pervasive, percussive feel that drives the song on and on. William&#8217;s unique vocal is displayed well here. It is one of his best vocal performances. This song is one of the main reasons I fell in love with William&#8217;s songwriting. I played <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/shuffle-off-to-buffalo/id383870633">Shuffle Off to Buffalo</a></em> so many times the laser dug its own pits in the CD. Quite simply, a classic.</p>

<h2>?Show Me?  </h2>
<p><strong>J M S Harrison:</strong> This gorgeous Glide song comes three songs in on the posthumous <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/last/id383874977">Last</a>* album. Initially when I discovered Glide in 2010 (many years after William had passed away in 1999), this album didn&#8217;t really grab me so I spent a lot more time listening to *<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/open-up-and-croon/id383875885">Open Up and Croon</a>* and *<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/shrink-wrapped-real-thing-ep/id383871962">Shrink Wrapped Real Thing</a>*, followed by the EPs, then lastly, *Last</em>. It hit me one night before jumping in the bath to revisit this album. I remembered from a couple years earlier that track 3 stood out. I quickly regretted missing out on those years not listening to it. It was recorded by William in his garage on four-track. </p>

<p>His parents gave us this unreleased video just a few months back that was made soon after he died. Lovely childhood footage. It was very special playing this song in Sydney to his parents with this video on the projector.</p>

<h2>?Something?  </h2>
<p><strong>J M S Harrison:</strong> ?I feel like I know her, but sometimes my arms bend back.? I feel like this is a Glide song everyone should hear. It&#8217;s off their debut (best) album <em>Open Up and Croon*. It&#8217;s got these up strums in the verse and awkward timing that&#8217;s harder to play than you think. I couldn&#8217;t work out the chords so I decided to message Paul McDonald (Glide member during *Croon</em> period) about how to play this song. He transcribed it for me, and a short time later it dawned on me that 2014 was 15 years since William passed away. I approached him about doing a tribute and from there we made it happen. Before too long many involved were saying these Glide songs were a lot harder to learn than they anticipated, me included. I wanted to play this song but found it quite challenging, so I decided just to enjoy listening to it, keeping it more of a mystery how it&#8217;s played on guitar.</p>

<h2>?A Dream?  </h2>
<p><strong>D.A. Calf:</strong> I tend to find I&#8217;m drawn to B-sides and lesser-known tracks when discovering past artists for the first time. Not sure if it&#8217;s the more raw or less inhibited/overthought nature of such tracks. Maybe the imperative to ?make it? (always rooted in the time/never timeless) that is by nature less present in the B-sides doesn&#8217;t always translate so well to another time. Either way, ?A Dream? has a combination of driving riff and overall simplicity that makes it a standout in the Glide catalogue.</p>
