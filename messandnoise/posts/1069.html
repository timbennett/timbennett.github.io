                <h3>As underrated Geelong-via-Melbourne songwriter Claire Birchall revisits two albums from more than a decade ago, she discusses her formative teen years and how each release allows her to move on. Interview by <strong>DAVID NICHOLS</strong>.

If there was a best album of 2012 (it&#8217;s hard remembering back that far), it could have been Claire Birchall&#8217;s <em><a href="http://clairebirchall.bandcamp.com/album/pp">PP</a></em>, an extraordinary m&#8217;lange of basic beats, distorted keyboard and guitar, and pop songs of exceptional resilience. Her new album is a double CD of old songs which were never properly heard the first time, yet should be. </p>
<p>There are a lot of massively talented musicians around who are often, generally speaking, overlooked, though that&#8217;s a relative term of course and for most of them it&#8217;s for the best; exposure would just spoil them. Counting Paper Planes? <a href="/releases/2000146">one album</a>, Claire Birchall has released four superb and diverse CDs. Paper Planes were Birchall&#8217;s full-tilt rock band; they released their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=1UmNo0hLLNY">last single</a> in 2010. She put out <em>PP* almost exactly a year ago, to little fanfare (including a <a href="/articles/4488228">rather desultory</a> review on *Mess + Noise</em>, in which a reviewer seemed a little indignant that someone he had never heard of had done something good). </p>
<p>Personally I would be hard-pressed to name a favourite amongst the four; they&#8217;re each stunning in their own way. Birchall&#8217;s music is the kind of thing that you will play when you&#8217;re on the radio and the announcer doing the next shift will come in and ask, in awe, ?What is that?!? (In the specific instance I&#8217;m thinking of, he then added, ?It&#8217;s beautiful!?). Her first CD, <em><a href="http://clairebirchall.bandcamp.com/album/captain-captain-2">Captain Captain</a>* (2001), and a hitherto very obscure cassette-only precursor, *<a href="http://clairebirchall.bandcamp.com/album/this-gallery-of-mine-2">This Gallery of Mine</a></em> (1999), are being made available as a double-package this month on her own Night Owl label. </p>
<p><strong>Does it feel weird to go back and revisit old things?</strong><br/>
Completely. Although it&#8217;s been something that&#8217;s been bugging me for this whole time &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe that I never had <em>Captain Captain* mastered or that I never did anything with *This Gallery of Mine*. They&#8217;re two albums I&#8217;m pretty proud of, and it&#8217;s been in the back of my mind: ?I&#8217;ve gotta do something?? I had *Captain Captain* mastered and I was so stoked with it that I did *This Gallery of Mine</em> as well. </p>
<p>It brought back some old feelings; they&#8217;re pretty moody-sounding records. It&#8217;s weird to think back to your 20-year-old self nearly 15 years later.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe <em>Captain Captain</em>?</strong><br/>
Highly contrasting to my newer songs, that&#8217;s for sure. It&#8217;s all mainly acoustic guitar-based. There&#8217;s also mandolin and pump organ &#8211; a lot more high singing by myself, interweaving harmonies. I only ever did a self-release, when CD burners first became available, and I got to move on from handing round cassette tapes.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I thought I&#8217;d make an album like a Kiss solo record.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Does every album require a change of sound and style?</strong><br/>
Not intentionally. I started recording as a teenager on my four-track. I always felt like I need to finish off something, make it an album before I can move on. Maybe that&#8217;s why my albums do change from record to record. There&#8217;s probably 20 albums of me learning how to write songs and moving from record to record. [?Even with no real urge to properly release this stuff,? she writes in the sleeve notes to the new double CD, ?mixing the songs down to make these ?albums? made it easier to move on, to leave those songs be, and start a whole new thing.?]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a huge change from those two earlier albums to the Paper Planes to <em>PP</em>.</strong><br/>
After a while I do like to write different types of songs and some songs I&#8217;d bring in to the band, I could instantly tell they wouldn&#8217;t fit. There&#8217;d been a few line-up changes over the years with the Paper Planes and a few years ago it looked like there might be another one on the horizon &#8211; I&#8217;d been doing the Paper Planes indie rock thing for a long time [and] you start getting in a bit of a box in terms of what songs you can do. I had been really neglecting my home-recording stuff too. I guess I was having trouble finding the time to do four-track recordings.</p>

<p/>
<p>I&#8217;d been really getting into Kiss. I thought I&#8217;d make an album like a Kiss solo record. ?PP? is a musical term which means to play softly, and because I recorded it at home I couldn&#8217;t use my 180-watt Fender Super Twin so I played through my little practice amp and everything was very quietly done. [The title could stand for] ?Paper Planes?, or playing quietly.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3036980/345x390-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The beats are actually my Casio keyboard &#8211; presets with a fill button. I do the bass line on the keyboard at the same time as I was running the drums. Generally, you try to cram as much into each track as possible. Plus it&#8217;s nice to experiment with what you are having together on the one track. You get some nice blending of sounds &#8211; I was getting into that sound of the Casio really distorted and the bass cut out sometimes. I started really digging that. I&#8217;m stoked with how big it sounds when I think about how minimal some of the songs are. </p>
<p><strong>How did you feel about the <em>M+N</em> review?</strong><br/>
I think the timing of it made me feel odd, because you do all this preparation leading up to a launch and you&#8217;re trying your darnedest to get all the publicity that you can. ?Oh, excellent, I&#8217;ve finally got a review? and I looked at it and it was like, ?Oh &#8211; bummer? but there were a lot of encouraging comments from people down the bottom &#8211; it gave me some publicity, anyway.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I often don&#8217;t know what my songs are really about.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A lot of your songs seem to come from being pissed off with someone.</strong><br/>
I very rarely sit down and think ?I&#8217;m going to write a song about this? &#8211; it just happens. You just open your mouth and start singing, write a chorus all in one go. I often don&#8217;t know what my songs are really about. I keep notebooks and jot down lines here and there. A lot of my songwriting does come from past experience. You just conjure up old emotions to try to combine events into one or? </p>
<p><strong>You grew up in??</strong><br/>
Jan Juc. I lived in Geelong throughout my early 20s, but spent the first 20 years of my life in Jan Juc. It&#8217;s about 20 minutes? drive from Geelong. </p>
<p><strong>So do you write about Geelong?</strong><br/>
Perhaps not intentionally &#8211; growing up in a small town &#8211; I guess there is ?Leaving This Town? [on <em>PP</em>] &#8211; obviously that&#8217;s about leaving Geelong and moving to Melbourne.</p>
<p>Growing up a small town like Jan Juc and not having much of a way of getting around, buses were pretty far apart. Being a teenager and living so far away from where your high school friends are living &#8211; that&#8217;s something that stuck with me as a theme over the years.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>So what did you do?</strong><br/>
I played a lot of music &#8211; with my sister, we&#8217;d do a lot of home recording, jam and work out cover songs, went through our learning of playing and singing together. Dinosaur Jr. songs, or whatever. My sister&#8217;s older. She put me on to a lot, and her partner also; he&#8217;s a few years older than her, so I came into contact with that sort of stuff &#8211; he put me on to Dinosaur Jr.</p>
<p>In Geelong, anyone who&#8217;s playing music, you end up meeting each other. There was definitely a lot of tape swapping going on around Geelong. Matt Nicholson, Jarrod Quarrell [of Lost Animal, St Helens and The New Season], Golden Lifestyle Band; I did my first gig with GLB. </p>
<p>I used to busk in the centre of Geelong, starting out trying to find my voice at that time &#8211; I met a lot of people at that time [playing] Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh and Nirvana. That&#8217;s how I met my partner Matt as well. In the mall.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;d have to catch a bus to go and hang out in the store. Which I did.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Because of what you were playing? What was it?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t remember what I was playing, but I do remember he was wearing a purple Dinosaur Jr. t-shirt. I was lucky through the ?90s; there was that real trend for the all-ages show that was great for me as a teenager. I was right into Magic Dirt and as a 15-year-old I&#8217;d go to those all-ages shows at St. Mary&#8217;s Hall. I even have Daniel Herring, the original MD guitarist, playing on my records. I try to get him involved in whatever I can.</p>
<p>In the early-to-mid-?90s in Torquay, an awesome independent video store opened up, called Schlock Horror. It was owned and run by Mario Borelli, founder of Mr. Spaceman Records, and he had a great range of indie-music videos and movies. I&#8217;d hire out stuff like <em>The Year Punk Broke</em> video over and over. He&#8217;d also stock a bit of vinyl and stuff by local bands, and I remember buying the first Magic Dirt 7? off the counter at Mario&#8217;s shop. I&#8217;d hang out in the shop and talk records and stuff with Mario heaps. He organised an in-store gig called The Big Day In when I was about 15, and Bored!, Warped, Spaghetti Westerns, Food and other local bands played. A great day. The shop eventually had to move to Geelong after a couple of years. Then I&#8217;d have to go catch a bus to go and hang out in the store. Which I did.</p>

<p>The Geelong store was in an arcade right next door to Chaos Records, with an adjoining door between the stores. Heaps of music people would hang out in those stores. I first met Dean Turner from Magic Dirt there one day as a dorky teenager, and I was chuffed. Dean became a great supporter of my music over the years. He was going to produce a Paper Planes record at one point and got us on board to support the Dirtbags a bunch of times. A really great guy.</p>
<p>Mario organised another in-store gig in the Geelong store, and Magic Dirt and other Geelong favourites played. Not long after, the shop closed down, followed shortly after by Chaos Records, and the arcade was sadly dead again. End of an era.</p>
<p>There was definitely a sense of community with the bands in Geelong &#8211; the Barwon Club gave us all our debut shows and stuff. My debut was with GLB. I think I had Matt Nicholson playing drums with me onstage. There was even talk I&#8217;d be joining GLB for a while there. Wacky tunings on the guitar &#8211; I&#8217;d end up having to borrow various people&#8217;s guitars so I could play a set?</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;ve been sidetracked by my old albums.?</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a couple of people in the audience that night that really gave me a hand getting my music off the ground: DJs Chris Scaddan <a href="/releases/2001164">now at triple j] and Peter Barker. At the time they had a radio show on the local Geelong station, 3YYR, called ?Loud Live and Local?. They also started up a fanzine, also called <em>Loud Live and Local</em>. It was responsible for a great sense of community amongst Geelong bands in the late ?90s, and there really was a bit of a scene going on for a little while there. I started meeting more and more people that played music, and ended up forming the first incarnation of Paper Planes with Stacka [Mark Stacey] from [The New Season</a> and Mark Brant.</p>
<p><strong>We talked a year ago, around the time you released <em>PP</em>. I accused you of being a slow worker, and you mentioned you had just finished a new album. Where&#8217;s that?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m still working on it &#8211; I&#8217;ve been sidetracked by my old albums. Although I&#8217;ve got finicky with this new album, last year I thought I was close to finished. But every time I record a new song, I think ?Oh, that&#8217;s actually better than one I thought was good enough.? I think I&#8217;m close.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using my loop pedal a bit, I&#8217;ve mixed things up a bit between loops &#8211; fuzzy guitar &#8211; but it&#8217;s also got a bit of a country vibe. There&#8217;s going to be a Hank Williams cover on there. It&#8217;s different from <em>PP</em>; not as much drums. </p>
<p><strong>So why aren&#8217;t you more famous?</strong><br/>
You tell me! </p>
