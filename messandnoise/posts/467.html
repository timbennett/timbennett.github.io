                <h3>In the suburbs of Adelaide, &#8216;Pig City&#8217; author <strong>ANDREW STAFFORD</strong> reckons he&#8217;s found Australia&#8217;s greatest teen prodigies since Melbourne gave us GOD. Don&#8217;t get too excited though: they broke up a year ago.

I was in Adelaide doing interviews for a second book when I paid a visit to Vic Flierle in his shop, Mr V Music, in the coastal suburb of Semaphore. Flierle is a grizzled veteran of Adelaide&#8217;s insular music scene: an original founder of local indie music Mecca, Big Star Records, and the former guitarist of retro-psych kings the Garden Path. He&#8217;s the classic record-store geek, generous and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d finished our interview and I was packing up my recorder when he told me he wanted to play me something he&#8217;d put out by a trio of Adelaide schoolgirls called Dandelion. He handed me a 12? EP housed in a beautifully textured blue sleeve. ?They were 13 when they made it,? he told me with a grin. The needle plunked into the groove. The first song was called ?The Quiet One?.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a ringing school bell, which then sped up &#8211; cute &#8211; followed by a classic, ringing riff and a high, girlish vocal. It sounded, I thought at the time, a bit like the Hummingbirds, or the early Bangles, with a healthy dash of Ramones, all of which was fine by me. I was still skeptical, though; Vic was, after all, trying to sell me something, and I had already picked out a couple of items.</p>
<p>?You may never hear a peep out of me,? the song began. ?That&#8217;s cos I just want to be left to be.? The lyrics spoke, perfectly, of teenage awkwardness and shyness, then the stop-start chorus barged in: ?Sometimes I wanna yell/I wanna shout/I wanna scream until my lungs burst out/Cos I&#8217;m asking, am I the quiet one??</p>
<p>The performance was tight, the recording clear as a bell, the tune as catchy as measles, all packed into two-and-a-half minutes. Not bad.</p>
<p>The next song was bluntly called ?That Sucks?. It opened with a slightly off-kilter, almost Go-Betweens rhythm, before bursting into a full-frontal attack chorus. The combination of loud-quiet big bang and high melody reminded me not so much of Nirvana as Ratcat. ?Listen to this,? Vic interrupted suddenly &#8211; then the guitar solo hit, even louder.</p>
<p>Those 15 seconds of pure joy was when it really hit me. Vic flipped over the EP while I picked my head up off the floor. There were three more songs. It was all over in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Needless to say I bought the EP, and took away a couple of CDs too. I had to make a five-hour drive by car to Broken Hill. I listened to the EP, which I didn&#8217;t realise until much later had actually come out a full year ago, over and over again. I played ?That Sucks?, especially, until my ears bled. Other than the <a href="/releases/2000636">Hits album</a>, I haven&#8217;t been so smitten with anything all year.</p>
<p>When I got home, I found Dandelion&#8217;s MySpace <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dandeliontheband">page</a>, set up by Vic&#8217;s label <a href="http://www.walkingbirdrecords.com.au">Walking Bird Records</a>. They had just three friends.</p>
<p>How on earth did this astonishing slice of punk-power-pop heaven escape all notice? Why weren&#8217;t they all over youth radio and morning television until we were all completely sick of them? Why weren&#8217;t they tearing up Big Day Out stages around the country? I can only put it down to the self-effacing nature of the Adelaide scene. And the fact that Dandelion don&#8217;t even exist anymore. </p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>The story of how Flierle came into contact with Dandelion is ordinary enough. At a Sunday afternoon barbecue in the Adelaide suburbs, he was slipped a CD by an old friend who asked if he would like to hear her 13-year-old daughter&#8217;s band. The band&#8217;s name was Daydream Blue. Flierle didn&#8217;t like the name, and didn&#8217;t have high hopes for a recording by a trio of schoolgirls.</p>
<p>The CD lay around the house for weeks until Flierle began to fret about getting the inevitable embarrassing question from his friend about whether or not he liked the CD before he&#8217;d actually listened to it. That might not be as awkward as telling her he hated it, though. He put it on, and breathed out. It was love at first listen.</p>
<p>?About halfway through the first track I realised it was really good,? he says. ?By the time I&#8217;d heard it all I was dumbfounded.?</p>
<p>Flierle played the CD again, then again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>?I played it every day for six months, and it lost none of its power,? he says. ?It reminded me of all the great power pop gems, like the Real Kids? ?All Kindsa Girls? and the Flamin? Groovies? ?Shake Some Action?. Timeless, innocent, fun yet defiant.?</p>
<p>Of course, the girls weren&#8217;t listening to any such old farts. They were listening to the power-pop of the previous decade &#8211; Green Day, mainly &#8211; proving that you don&#8217;t need to be a rock history buff to intuitively arrive at a sound that captures everything that&#8217;s magic about pop music on your first attempt.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a wonderful moment in the film version of Nick Hornby&#8217;s <em>High Fidelity</em> where record store owner Rob Gordon decides to release the tape made by local shoplifters the Kinky Wizards. This was Flierle&#8217;s such moment (not that the girls from Daydream Blue indulged in any petty thievery, mind you). He decided he had to put out the CD himself &#8211; only to find out that the band had already broken up.</p>
<p>No amount of pleading would convince the girls, by then 15, to get back together, but they let Flierle release the EP anyway. And, given the band wasn&#8217;t playing anymore, they were unfussed when Flierle asked the girls? permission to rename Daydream Blue as Dandelion.</p>
<p>Flierle wanted to accompany the CD with a vinyl run: a stupendously (stupidly?) rare 100 copies. The songs, he says, reminded him of the two golden ages of vinyl &#8211; the mid ?60s and the late ?70s. The record was launched at West Beach, Adelaide on February 15 2009 &#8211; Flierle&#8217;s 50th birthday.</p>
<p>And, having refused all requests to perform even one show to mark the event, the girls perversely did end up reforming for one show only, months later: a going-away party for some international student friends. The location was a school hall, on a Saturday afternoon. It was their fifth and final gig.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>Daydream Blue came together in early 2007. Guitarist Lauren Wells-Jones and bass player/singer Tamika Innes were 13. Drummer Ariya Gabell was just 12. Wells-Jones and Gabell had been playing since they were in fifth grade, while Innes played saxophone. She picked up the bass because Gabell and Wells-Jones needed a bass player. And she was a natural, unaffected singer.</p>
<p>It was Daydream Blue&#8217;s good fortune that Gabell&#8217;s dad, Scott, was the owner of a rehearsal studio in the north-west Adelaide suburb of Windsor Gardens. Every Friday after school, the trio would practice, starting with Green Day and Blink-182 covers.<br/>
Then they wrote their first song. ?It was a bit of a joke at first, because we needed to do some poems for school,? says Wells-Jones, now 16. The poem was called ?I Hate School?; Wells-Jones supplied the chords. (The song survived to make the EP.) More songs followed. Most were written by Innes.</p>
<blockquote><p>?You don&#8217;t need to be a rock history buff to intuitively arrive at a sound that captures everything that&#8217;s magic about pop music on your first attempt.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Gabell supplied the band&#8217;s gear and, as the band&#8217;s taxi service and roadie, saw all of the band&#8217;s gigs, including a couple of school talent nights and their year seven primary school graduation. It was after this gig &#8211; their fourth, and until the 2009 reunion, their last &#8211; that he decided to record them.</p>
<p>?There was chemistry there, they had an attitude I was kind of envious of,? says Gabell, who himself had played in Adelaide covers and originals bands ?of no notoriety? before moving into production. ?They seemed to be expressing their angst in their music, which I thought was great. I encouraged them to explore that angst.?</p>
<p>A little scarily, despite the girls? obvious accomplishment on their instruments, Gabell was actually slightly disappointed by the end result. ?I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the best they could have done,? he says. ?I think they were in the process of getting better when it all kind of fell to the wayside.</p>
<p>?But they were very young, and you can only expect so much from musicians of that age. Because I was around them so much, I forgot how young they were. They come across as a little more mature in both the way they present their music and the level of what they were playing.?</p>
<p>Why did it fall by the wayside? ?Because we were only 13, 14, we didn&#8217;t have that many commitments,? Wells-Jones says simply. As the demands of high school increased, the band practised less. While Wells-Jones and Gabell remained keen, Innes, as it turns out, really did want to just be left to be. She was the quiet one.</p>
<p>?It was mostly Tamika,? Jones-Wells says. ?I was happy to keep playing and so was Ariya, but for some reason Tamika just found it too hard &#8230; When she was younger she was in heaps of productions and TV adverts and things like that, so I think she&#8217;d just, like, had enough. And when we were starting to realise that we could go somewhere&#8230;?</p>
<p>What if the Big Day Out came calling tomorrow? ?Well, I would be all for it, and I&#8217;m sure Ariya would be as well, and we&#8217;d try and convince Tamika to get back into it. Hopefully it would be a happening thing &#8230; You never know.? </p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>The trio are all still friends, and in the meantime, Wells-Jones and Gabell are playing and recording together in a new band called Honeybuzzard with Flierle&#8217;s 16-year-old daughter Emilie, who also has her own CD out on Flierle&#8217;s label Walking Bird Records. ?We like where it&#8217;s going,? Wells-Jones says. ?With Dandelion, obviously we had something there, but we were just too young.?</p>
<p>In a lifetime listening to music, I can honestly say I have never come across a story quite like Dandelion&#8217;s. It&#8217;s simply perfect pop &#8211; ephemeral yet integral, naive yet somehow knowing. But as perfect as the record is, Vic Flierle&#8217;s new name might just be the most inspired thing about them: plucked from the ground; then blown away in a puff of wind.</p>
