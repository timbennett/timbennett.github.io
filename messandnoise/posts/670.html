<p/>
<p><strong>Were you looking for a particular theme for Meredith&#8217;s 21st?</strong><br/>
Helloooo! Thanks for having me. What? Theme, yes! Particular, no. It&#8217;s her 21st so that obviously means ?party?. Derrr. Not just lets-go-crazy-lets-get-nuts party, more every-colour-of-the-rainbow-plus-white-and-black-and-brown-and-peuse party. Party like the internet doesn&#8217;t matter. Party like Nick Cave&#8217;s moustache, party like a penis flouncing clockwise in the Gift. Party like you&#8217;re a hippy and you believe in Full Moons. </p>
<p><strong>What do you expect to be the big crowning moment?</strong><br/>
Well, it&#8217;s hard to go past a Total Lunar Eclipse isn&#8217;t it. Although ?moment? goes for 51 minutes and eight seconds, that&#8217;s a lot of crown. But yeah this lineup more than most in recent years has some gemmy little timebombs in it that will expand over the coming months and then detonate at several junctures over the weekend, mostly unexpectedly. Many of Meredith&#8217;s finest moments over the 21 years were surprises that few predicted. I guess a lunar eclipse is something that can be predicted though. And well in advance. How good is science. Apparently the chance of a total lunar eclipse occurring on Saturday night at Meredith this year was 7.453 billion to one. 7.453 billion to one! I mean what are the chances!</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>How long do you spend putting together the line-up?</strong><br/>
I tell you, it never ends these days. There&#8217;s really no time when we AREN&#8217;T putting something together. So how long? Most waking hours. And plenty of sleeping hours too. I have this recurring dream where suddenly I find myself at Meredith and the festival&#8217;s started but I&#8217;m not ready. Instead of being at the Supernatural Amphitheatre, Meredith is happening in a train station in Auckland, or at the Barwon Club in Geelong in 1987. One dream recently U2 were playing for some reason but they wouldn&#8217;t go on stage until everyone in the crowd was sitting on milk crates. It was tense! But my dreams aren&#8217;t linear; I think one minute later I was a trout.</p>
<p><strong>Do you look at other festivals for guidance?</strong><br/>
I presume you mean modern music festivals. ?Festivals? have been around since the dawn of time. Or soon after. Time came before mankind right? The best festivals throughout history &#8211; the ones that have lasted &#8211; serve a social purpose, have an element of tradition, and allow those that partake to contribute and shape the festival according to their wishes. You can&#8217;t just install culture like astro-turf &#8211; all good things take time. No I don&#8217;t look at other ?festivals?. I assume some are just shopping centres with a soundtrack, but I&#8217;m just guessing.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a bit of an overlap with <a href="/news/4298391">Homebake</a>. did you guys join forces?</strong><br/>
Not intentionally, no. Just happenstance. We both had a couple of similar thoughts this year, its bound to happen. You have to hand it to Homebake &#8211; to stick to their guns presenting all local music for so many years is remarkable. And to take a year off rather than serve up something sub-standard is something to be admired and respected. That&#8217;s integrity. But yeah, Meredith has always had a very strong local element and so its natural that some years we have a few of the same acts. Icehouse I think we could only have done at Meredith in 1981 or 2011. And as we didn&#8217;t exist in 1981 this is the year. Timing is everything.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a strong local contingent this year. Was that a particular focus for you?</strong><br/>
Yes, of course. Meredith was 100 percent local acts for the first seven years of its life, then we got offered Ion Svenonius? band The MakeUp in 1998 and we couldn&#8217;t see a good reason not to do it. It worked a treat too.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/63wf3Klgq_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe>  </p>
<p/>
<p>Meredith would not exist if the local scene wasn&#8217;t as interesting and high quality as it is. Melbourne alone is like a never ending wellspring of interesting new music. It really is. Seeing a new band playing some little venue and realising they are amazing is more thrilling to us than booking a headliner. Truly. In fact as I write this our trusty scouts are in pubs watching bands, and its Wednesday night. They can&#8217;t proof-read this on their silly phones either! Who knows what I&#8217;ll say. Sometimes Meredith really helps to push a band to a new level, that&#8217;s something we get a lot of pleasure and satisfaction from. Also, Meredith now has so many traditional timeslots that require a specialist, like a certain type of band for a certain time of day and night. Invariably we can find that locally. Do I sound like Dick Smith? ?Don&#8217;t get bands made cheap in China when you can put jobs in the local industry.?</p>
<p><strong>What local band, in particular, should we look out for?</strong><br/>
The ReChords.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Are graveyard train the first to do the Golden Plains/Meredith double in the same year?</strong><br/>
Actually no, they are the fourth, behind Gotye, The Drones, and Eddy Cuz. Not bad company to be in. I really like that Gotye song but why is he disguised as Federation Square in the video?</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>How long have you been trying to court Mudhoney? and were you surprised they said yes given they rarely play?</strong><br/>
I think in the ?90s it was such an impossible dream that we didn&#8217;t even try. Then its been on and off the drawing board in recent years, I think there was one year where it might have been possible for them but not for us for some reason, then this year when we got the call from Dave Chatfield at Handsome Tours saying it could probably happen it just felt like a great time for it to finally take place. Timing is everything.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Who found out about the eclipse?</strong><br/>
Well, every year Uncle Doug checks the lunar calendar to see how much moonlight the festival will have. But he built a whole lot of excellent lamplights on the site so he didn&#8217;t check this year. Then we saw a Tweet from someone named <strike>Catherine Deveny</strike> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Team_Devery">Catherine Devery</a> that ?there&#8217;s going to be lunar eclipse at Meredith?. So we checked it out and it was true and we could not fecking believe it when we realised it was to reach its ?peak? just after midnight Saturday. Meredith has a long and checkered history with atmospheric conditions but Jesus H Christ does this one take the cake. <strike>Catherine Deveny</strike> Catherine Devery, whoever you are, please contact me you get a free ticket my little astronomical messenger angel.</p>
<p><strong>What does grinderman think about it?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d be a fool to think I can speak for them wouldn&#8217;t I! What I will say is you don&#8217;t need ANYTHING to enhance a Grinderman show, not even an astronomical wonder. We had already set the playing times before we knew about the eclipse and the fact that it happens just after they finish is a fluke. A beautiful, beautiful fluke. It&#8217;s almost enough to make me believe in right and wrong! Do we turn out all the lights out so everyone can see it better, or not? Our safety officer says ?not? but I think we can. We&#8217;ll distract him with a chocolate bar like a security guard in a movie. Apparently it&#8217;s best viewed in the country away from ?light pollution?. The whole thing has a three-hour build-up so there&#8217;ll be plenty of time to witness it. Time is a bridge.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Have you tried to get nick cave to play in the past?</strong><br/>
Of course. It&#8217;s never quite worked out, for one reason or another. Cannot believe its finally happening to be honest. It&#8217;s certainly a holy grail. Box ticked! You know at the very first Meredith in 1991, well, it was really just a party where everyone stayed the night. There was no bands playing Sunday arvo, but a few people in the ?crowd? had been partying the whole time and started singing songs. This became a singalong. Someone got a guitar. Then it made its way up onto stage and went for hours with people joining in. Nobody wanted to leave. That&#8217;s where the concept of ?Sunday? at Meredith started. There&#8217;s some home video footage of it and of course they sing a Nick Cave song. Having him there is absolutely a meaningful thing in soooo many ways. How good are Grinderman?!! I mean that&#8217;s hardly just a ?side project? is it!! Jeeeesus. What a band. My God we are blessed.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Will there be a 6.30 singalong?</strong><br/>
After the astonishing Neil Finn thing last year and Paul Kelly the year before we are somewhat ?retiring the jumper? in football parlance. We do love traditions at Meredith but we also think if you can&#8217;t beat last year&#8217;s thing then don&#8217;t do a sub-standard ?thing? just to keep a winning formula, otherwise it becomes a losing formula pretty quickly. Sooooo &#8211; I am sure there will be some very large singalongs going on a few times over the weekend, but it won&#8217;t be exactly the same as last year, nor should it. One thing we have seemingly only just realised is that Friday night also has a sunset! So we will program appropriate things in there from now on. That doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily ?singalong?, just maybe an act with a dynamic range, including some ?mellow? or introspective moments. This year will be Kurt Vile Friday night. Love that kid.</p>

<p><strong>Why aren&#8217;t Combo [Combo La Revelacion] playing this year?</strong><br/>
Time for a rest. Freshen up. Combo is such a wonderful thing you don&#8217;t want it to go stale. They had 2005 off as well, and that worked wonders. I was talking to Jorge Aguilar, Combo bandleader at last year&#8217;s Meredith and he said he&#8217;d had thoughts about it being time to take a break. As much as many people love it, it has to be right for the band too. It feels right to be presenting something new at that time on Saturday night this year. Timing is everything.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d like to finish this nonsense by saying Meredith line-ups are designed to be great on the day, not just on the poster, so however it looks on your screen now, it&#8217;ll be a million times better in the flesh.</p>
