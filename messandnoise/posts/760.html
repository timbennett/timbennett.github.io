                <h3>Some observations from Big Day Out veteran <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>* as the festival celebrated its 20th year at Flemington Racecourse on Sunday (January 29). Photos by *</em>LEAH ROBERTSON</strong>.
</h3>
<h2>?Are you nice and sweaty??</h2>
<p>Attending a festival in 35-degree heat is difficult enough without bands telling you just how hot it is. ?Hope you don&#8217;t die in this heat,? quipped <strong>Stonefield&#8217;s<em>* singer Amy Findlay at midday when the sun was at the height of its powers. ?Are you nice and sweaty?? quizzed **The Vaccines?** Justin Young. *</em>Kimbra Johnson</strong> asked us if we were ?hot and sticky?, before Soundgarden&#8217;s Chris Cornell thanked us profusely for braving the conditions to watch the grunge overlords play in a paddock with no shade. Meredith may be cursed with the odd bout of <a href="/articles/3436968">shitty weather</a>, but I can&#8217;t remember a single Big Day Out where I didn&#8217;t come home with sunstroke. All side stages were undercover this year, which provided a welcome reprieve from the sun, but shaded areas around Flemington were scarce. Oh, and if the Cancer Council were really serious about preventing melanomas, they wouldn&#8217;t sell pint-sized sunscreen bottles for $5.</p>

<p/>
<h2>The Hottest 100 comes alive</h2>
<p>Acts performing at this year&#8217;s Big Day Out comprised 23 percent of this year&#8217;s triple j Hottest 100, with multiple inclusions from <strong>Boy &amp; Bear<em>* (three), **Kimbra** (four including the list-topping ?Somebody That I Used To Know?), **Architecture In Helsinki** (two), **Drapht** (two) and *</em>Kanye West</strong> (two). As a point of comparison, only five percent of songs were from acts performing at the upcoming Laneway. I&#8217;m no mathematician, but I guess this means people that listen to triple j are more likely to attend the Big Day Out. Then again, maybe not.</p>

<h2>The Living End are the BDO house band</h2>
<p>Four Big Day Outs in nine years. Enough said.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3026951/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="427"/>
<p/>
<h2>Downsizing wasn&#8217;t restricted to Adelaide, Perth</h2>
<p>Organisers are claiming 42,000 people attended the event, which represents a 10,000 drop in attendance (an entire Meredith&#8217;s worth) on last year&#8217;s sold-out event. It felt like a lot less. While that number may&#8217;ve given lone promoter Ken West heart palpitations, it made for a relatively stress- and queue-free day.</p>
<p>With Harvest&#8217;s <a href="/articles/4369785">less-than-perfect start</a> in November still etched into my brain &#8211; if you wanted a beer or something to eat you&#8217;d run the risk of missing an entire band&#8217;s set &#8211; I prepared myself for an afternoon of queuing for wristbands, which would allow you to queue for tokens, which you would need to queue for beers, which in turn would force you to queue for toilets. However, the longest queue I waited in was about five deep (for $4 water) and there were no lines when I entered the main entrance around midday. Food outlets were in abundance, and both times I frequented <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Beatbox-Kitchen/108806049145877">Beatbox Kitchen</a> I walked straight up to the till. It had absolutely nothing to do with the quality of food as this unsent Tweet &#8211; thanks Optus &#8211; attests: ?Burger coma @bdo_official.?</p>
<p>Similarly, walking into the D-barrier for <strong>Soundgarden<em>* was a breeze compared to The Stooges last year, where I queued for 40 minutes and had to endure an entire John Butler set (which ran overtime). Fifteen minutes before showtime &#8211; while *</em>Kasabian</strong> were acting like coked-up show ponies on the Blue Stage &#8211; I simply strolled into the D and walked within 10 metres of the photographer pit. The right side of the stage may&#8217;ve been chockers ahead of Kanye West, but on the left, you could literally do windmills and not hit a soul. I&#8217;ve never seen the D (at that time, at least) so dead.</p>

<p/>
<h2>Bogans are finally learning to behave</h2>
<p>Or perhaps they&#8217;ve just co-opted Stereosonic? Either way, the dickhead antics the Big Day Out has become synonymous with over the past few years &#8211; flag kissing, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=lqdJXOwywnA">shoulder jousting</a>, stupid T-shirts, overt douchery, macho rabble rousing &#8211; was noticeably on the decline in 2012. Perhaps that&#8217;s down to an over officious security presence, which appeared ready to pounce at any moment. Some harmless man-on-man shoulder dancing was cut short during Battles. Isn&#8217;t this stuff supposed to ?colour? the event?</p>
<p>(On a semi-related note, beer-branded singlets have now replaced NBA jerseys as the #1 choice of bogan festival attire. It seems the popularity of the sport has surged to levels not seen since Bruce Bolden and Lanard Copeland were slam-dunking their way into Steve Carfino&#8217;s ?NBL Top 10 Plays of the Week? in the early 1990s. I blame cultural imperialism &#8211; and LeBron James.)</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3026962/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="427"/>
<p/>
<h2>A tale of two headliners</h2>
<p>In a revealing <a href="/articles/4409823">interview</a> with <em>M+N</em> ahead of the Gold Coast leg, <a href="/news/4361207">lone promoter</a> Ken West spoke of his disappointment at failing to land a ?bona fide headliner? such as Prince. ?Basically we had a problem with two acts who weren&#8217;t quite perfect to close and neither would play second last,? he said.</p>
<p>He was right on one count only. </p>
<p>Fifteen years on from their last Big Day Out show, <strong>Soundgarden</strong> were a revelation in their 7.15pm Orange Stage slot. The band played a set for the fans, including surprise cuts from their back catalogue such as ?I Awake? and ?Gun? from <em>Louder Than Love*; ?Beyond The Wheel? from *Ultramega OK*; and ?Drawing Flies? from *Badmotorfinger*. Evergreen 47-year-old frontman Chris Cornell wound back the clock, belting out impossibly high numbers like ?The Day I Tried To Live? from *Superunknown</em>, one of the biggest rock albums of its time; while Matt Cameron proved his prog chops are somewhat wasted on Pearl Jam&#8217;s pithy 4/4 jams.</p>
<p>But that was back in the mid-1990s, a time before Skrillex and Girl Talk and smart phones pre-loaded with MP3s; when most in attendance were either not born, or being conceived (probably not to the strains of ?Spoonman?, but you can never underestimate the effect of dropped-D and 7/4 time on the libido). Soundgarden seemed a bit confounding/confronting for those who didn&#8217;t remember &#8211; even their ?pop? songs were never written straight &#8211; and by the time <strong>Kanye</strong> hit the stage, it was clear who the ?bona fide? headliner of this festival really was.</p>
<p>Yeezy emerged from a cherry picker right on cue with the opening line of ?Dark Fantasy?, ?Can we get much higher??. Like most of his set, the track was lifted from last year&#8217;s <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*; a confronting, cathartic, glorious mess of an album with no similes that must be torturous to recreate every night. Even from my position &#8211; about 800 metres back behind a blue recycle bin and a sea of teenagers on shoulders &#8211; it was still the kind of captivating theatre you&#8217;d expect from an act closing the Big Day Out main stage. There were dancers and lights and a backdrop that looked like Roman figures had actually been carved into the stage. When the whole thing wound up two hours later with a 20-minute version of *Runaway</em>, you wondered why Ken West (no relation) ever doubted him.</p>
<p>Who in the world could follow that? (Don&#8217;t say Prince.)</p>
<p/>
<h2>More Pixar, less Disney</h2>
<p>The Big Day Out is arguably at its best when it plays out like a Pixar film: surface-level stuff for the kids, with enough hidden jokes to get adults through the turnstiles. The rise of boutique festivals like Harvest, Laneway and Sugar Mountain, however, has somewhat cannabailzed the Big Day Out&#8217;s ability to book upper-tier, adult-indie acts. <strong>Best Coast<em>*, **R&#8217;yksopp** and *</em>Battles</strong> did their best to plug the gaps, but they&#8217;re not Wilco, TV On The Radio, My Morning Jacket or Primal Scream. The small crowd watching battles at 5pm on the Essential Stage &#8211; at the arse end of the festival, about a 15-minute walk from the main entrance &#8211; will attest to that. Battles, however, brought a lot of energy and dexterity to their set (does John Stanier really need to have his ride cymbal so high?), and Gary Numan made a disembodied cameo on ?My Machines? via video screen. The ?celebrities? that dotted the audience &#8211; Kimbra and her band, Nova&#8217;s Kate Langbroek and Boy &amp; Bear&#8217;s Dave Hosking &#8211; seemed to be having a great time as well.</p>

<h2>A good day for the locals</h2>
<p>Twenty-five homegrown acts played the Big Day Out this year. And while it wasn&#8217;t the most challenging of local bills &#8211; notable absentees included, but not limited to: Total Control, Lost Animal, Geoffrey O&#8217;Connor, Dick Diver, Twerps, Kitchen&#8217;s Floor, Royal Headache, Adalita, Wagons, Harmony, Jack Ladder, Richard In Your Mind, Oscar + Martin, Teeth and Tongue, Seekae and Witch Hats &#8211; most acquitted themselves rather well.</p>
<p><strong>Stonefield</strong> &#8211; from Darraweit Guim in rural Victoria &#8211; played to a large crowd at midday on the Green Stage. Their cover of ?Whole Lotta Love? was particularly impressive &#8211; no wonder the Poms <a href="/news/4286684">loved it at Glastonbury</a> &#8211; and they aired some new material from a forthcoming mini-LP. Singer/belter Amy Findlay has now stepped out from behind the kit, and while she&#8217;s still warming to her frontwoman role, it&#8217;s a welcome move. They finished with ?Through The Clover?, the single that put them on the radar of every booking agent in town.</p>
<p>Also from regional Victoria, <strong>King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard</strong> scored a plum 2pm spot on the Hot Produce stage courtesy of triple j&#8217;s ?Unearthed? competition. Their show was a frenetic, Cramps-inspired swamp-garage free-for-all, with more superfluous members than the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Happy Mondays combined. (They even have their own Bez, a shirtless member who flits between maracas, Theremin and tambourine. If only he did it with a bit more gusto.)</p>

<p><strong>Kimbra</strong> and her amazing band (including a drummer with a high-top fade recalling Kid from Kid ?n Play) seemed too big for the Green Stage, especially in the wake of her Hottest 100-topping duet with Gotye. The crowd went appropriately ballistic for ?Cameo Lover? (one of the finest pop songs &#8211; local or otherwise &#8211; of 2011) and they somehow pulled off a cover of Bobby Brown&#8217;s naff single ?Every Little Step?. The slinky ?Samaritan? was the wrong choice for a closer, though, ending things on a whimper and prompting a few early leavers.</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s <strong>Faker<em>* have endured a difficult six months &#8211; from a nightclub <a href="/news/4285726">king hit</a> in Tassie to the recent decision to give away their protracted third album <a href="/news/4379416">for free</a> &#8211; and singer Nathan Hudson seemed desperate to win us over. He spent the majority of the set running from one side of the stage to the other (guy <a href="/galleries/4291896">sure likes to run</a>), and the irony wasn&#8217;t lost on anyone when he sang, ?I try too hard?, while climbing up scaffolding like Airbourne&#8217;s Joel O&#8217;Keefe. Faker may draw from the same pool of ?80s influences as *</em>The Vaccines</strong> (The Cure, The Smiths, etc.), but they made their UK cohorts appear lackluster by comparison. Old single ?Quarter To Three? (?a song set in the backseat of a car at 2.45am?) went down well with the small, but dedicated crowd.</p>
<p>Another band that seemed too big for a side stage slot was <strong>Architecture In Helsinki</strong>, who came out slo-mo jogging to the theme from <em>Chariots of Fire* (later reprised by Kanye West). They opened with ?That Beep? from last year&#8217;s *<a href="/releases/2000850">Moment Bends</a></em>, dedicated a song to tennis player Rafael Nadal and showed off some synchronised dance moves they presumably nicked off Aleks &amp; The Ramps.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the local heritage slot went to <strong>Regurgitator</strong>, who looked unrecognisable in hair metal wigs. They played a set strewn with songs about ?smoking too much pot?, busted out ?Polyester Girl? from <em>UNIT</em> (which they played in full at Falls) and dug up some rap-metal gold like ?Kong Foo Sing?.</p>

<h2>Odd Future are exciting &#8211; even if their music isn&#8217;t</h2>
<p>?Controversial? LA hip-hop crew <strong>Odd Future</strong> hark back to the days when your parents didn&#8217;t want you to go to the Big Day Out because there were mosh-pits and loud guitars and subversive lyrics and &#8211; oh my god &#8211; girls with blue hair. Their 2.30pm Boiler Room Set was a whirlpool of teenage hormones, so much so you could smell the testosterone wafting off the unnecessarily buff 16-year-old boys (and a brave few girls) losing their shit at the front of the stage. Odd Future themselves were pretty confounding &#8211; too many emcees yelling shit over the top of each other &#8211; but this was precisely the kind of rite-of-passage kids at the Big Day Out have taken for two decades. The whole Boiler Room seemed on a constant knife edge, and things eventually tipped over when a few kids threw glass on stage.</p>

<h2>A note on Tony Hawk</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about skating, but this wasn&#8217;t anything like watching Tiger Woods at the driving range.</p>
