                <h3>Australia is still beset by a dire cultural apartheid when it comes to pop music, writes <strong>CLINTON WALKER</strong> in this extract from his recent Platform Paper &#8216;History is Made at Night: Live Music in Australia&#8217;.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3031243/440x639-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There are signs that the value of contemporary live music is starting to be appreciated. Late last year when the two reports emerging from the Tote debacle were released &#8211; Deloitte&#8217;s for Arts Victoria, <em><a href="/news/4308043">The economic, social and cultural contribution of venue-based live music in Victoria</a>*, and Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s nationally-oriented one for APRA, *<a href="/news/4331760">Economic Contribution of the venue-based live music industry in Australia</a></em> &#8211; they were the first attempts to even try to quantify this quicksilver cash economy. Of course, as everybody knows and as these reports confirmed, the value is enormous. The industry boasts nearly 4,000 venues nationally which put on more than 300,000 gigs a year and attract 40 million punters, generating more than a billion dollars? revenue and employing 15,000.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the late-1980s that any real attempt was made to quantify the music industry generally, 30 years after the rock ?n? roll paradigm started to change society and culture irreversibly. This wasn&#8217;t only due to the laissez-faire nature of the game, which made it so hard to pin down, but also because of the contempt in which it was and is still held in some circles.</p>
<p>Even in the &#8217;80s, when the smell of money finally dominated all the usual moral and artistic reservations &#8211; when Austrade formed EMA (Export Music Australia) in response to the success being enjoyed in the US by bands like INXS, Midnight Oil and Crowded House &#8211; CD sales were the only (unreliable) measure there was. The massive other half of the industry, the scatterling live scene, was just too hard to corral into anything beyond a hazy big picture.</p>
<p>And there in the too-hard basket it&#8217;s largely remained, notwithstanding a spate of mostly-ignored reports about a decade back. Everybody knows, and has for a long time, that contemporary popular music is perhaps bigger than all the other performing arts put together. Everybody knows that most people listen to popular music, rock, and not to classical music or opera or jazz. Everybody knows that popular music is Low, just as everybody knows classical music is High. </p>

<p/>
<p>That this latter cloud still hovers over the cultural worth of contemporary live music is one of the fundamental reasons for its present problems. Amid the sea of placards at the <a href="/articles/3882468">SLAM rally</a>, there was one that read, ?We want arts security.? Everybody knows there&#8217;s little security for anyone in any branch of the arts, but I believe this banner was about recognition or acknowledgement. Because it&#8217;s still the fact that popular music is not accepted as a legitimate art form by our political and cultural gatekeepers that it&#8217;s never been able to count on any of the protection, support or advocacy that&#8217;s helped so many other art forms. It&#8217;s always had to struggle in isolation to carve out a safe place for its practice. Peter Rechniewski&#8217;s definition of jazz as ?the permanent underground? applies equally to popular live music.  </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3031242/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>This is merely one symptom of the dire cultural apartheid that still besets Australia. Everybody knows that classical music and opera command only a tiny share of the market, yet the lion&#8217;s share of Australia Council funding. Everybody knows that our arts establishment is an elitist cabal that disdains the vulgarity of popular music and only looks after its own. </p>
<p>The Tote Hotel became such a cause c&#8217;l?bre in 2010 that its life and <a href="/articles/3850129">death</a>, like that of Rowland Howard, was turned into a documentary film. And when <em><a href="/news/4453493">Persecution Blues</a>* was premiered at the 2011 Melbourne Film Festival alongside Richard Lowenstein&#8217;s Howard biopic *<a href="/news/4304436">Autoluminescent</a>*, both won rousing ovations. *Persecution Blues</em> took its title from a song of the same name by Melbourne punk band The Powder Monkeys, who were regulars at the Tote in the 1990s, and it&#8217;s an apt tag for a lot of the feeling that has always infected pub rock. As a self-image it&#8217;s not a good one, because obviously it can become self-defeating. I know because I&#8217;ve wrestled with it myself for nearly 40 years. But even after researching this Platform Paper led me to confront many of these same demons all over again, I still can&#8217;t come to any different conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody knows that books are literature, whereas popular music is a grossly cynical commercial enterprise without a redeeming feature.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Opera Australia chief Lyndon Terracini ruffled a few feathers last year when he gave the annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address. Unlike some of his more arrogant and reactionary colleagues who seem to assume certain divine rights, Terracini had the good grace to admit to a degree of guilt over the amount of money OA gets from government and its sense of ?patrician entitlement? when, as he put it, OA and ?classical music in general? was atrophied in the past and attracted a small and elitist audience that&#8217;s getting smaller and more reactionary. OA should be looking harder for new ways and new work to attract new audiences. </p>
<p>Popular music isn&#8217;t in search of an audience, nor is it seeking to remix its demographic; it&#8217;s already got a vast and incredibly diverse audience. It doesn&#8217;t seek grand public monuments like an Opera House either. Everybody knows it&#8217;s (almost) never received government funding, and it&#8217;s hardly about to start sticking its hand out now. All it&#8217;s really asking is that when it does find some little hole in the wall in which to perform without harming anyone, it&#8217;s not harassed in doing so. All it&#8217;s asking is that the contempt, vilification and harassment stop. Now.</p>
