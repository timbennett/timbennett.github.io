                <h3>In part one of their Japan tour diary, Aleks &amp; The Ramps and ii hit a roadblock in Sydney, take a detour in Kanazawa and reach their first pit-stop before Tokyo: Nagoya.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Preface</h2>
<p/>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Begin at the beginning, eh? Touring is a funny old thing. When you decide to book a tour, everything seems rosy. &#8220;Tour Japan? Yeah! How much fun will that be?&#8221; The closer you get to departure, the more things start stacking up in the ?work? pile. Booking shows, accommodation, rehearsing, fixing/buying/building equipment. Pretty soon you realise that instead of awesome, this thing could wind up being awful.</p>
<p>We did get our shit together, though. We were rehearsed up, packed and feeling excited about the impending trip. While it was very hard to gauge how the shows were looking in Japan, we had good vibes and were looking forward to kickin&#8217; out the jams again after a six-month break from the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> Instead of sleeping, I spent the week before leaving Melbourne staying up all night designing souvenir postcards, web flyers and CD covers, and trying to mix a Japan-only ii EP. My cats looked on, bewildered as I laid fresh screenprints over every surface of my living room and kitchen. Music was almost the last thing on my mind; instead, I longed for the opportunity to sleep through our flights.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Sydney</h2>
<p/>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Tired and confused, running late and hungover (or still drunk) from a show at Spectrum the night before, we nevertheless made it to Kingsford-Smith in time to check in. Band members deposited their passports on the desk. Oooh &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry guys. I fucked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>My brain momentarily shut down as I realised I had left my passport in Melbourne. All I could think about was going to sleep. Fuck it &#8211; go home, sleep for a few days and forget about the whole mess. Jon and Aleks suggested I go to the service desk to try to secure another flight, then spend the day figuring out how to get a hold of my passport. I lined up, and slowly my brain kicked into gear. I started to see a way out. It&#8217;d probably be expensive, but I could re-book for the next day and get my passport sent up by same day courier.</p>
<p>I phoned the band, who were still checking in, and let them know it was alright. &#8220;I&#8217;ll figure it out and see you in Japan.&#8221;  Jon answered: &#8220;Looks like you&#8217;ll have some company.&#8221; It turned out that Janita&#8217;s passport expired months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Passports, everyone!<br/>
Simon throws his hands skyward.<br/>
Oh no you DID not!  </p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I could only imagine how stressed out Aleks and the rest of the band were, and would continue to be for the next 36 hours. The flight was about to leave, so the others needed to make a run for the gate. We told them we&#8217;d see them in Japan: it&#8217;d work out. I wasn&#8217;t so sure, but we needed to try to remain positive. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016253/400x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Janita and I got to the front of the service desk line and explained our situation to the airline staff. I expected a total lack of sympathy: we&#8217;d made a stupid mistake and didn&#8217;t really deserve any. Instead, the flustered staff member found a seat for each of us on the following day&#8217;s flight, and after quickly checking with her manager, made the change for free. WTF!? &#8220;Uh, thank you sooo much,&#8221; we said, backing away quietly before they changed their minds. We spent the next couple of hours in the departure terminal calling DHL couriers and DFAT trying to find solutions to our respective passport problems. I arranged for my sister to go to my house, grab mine from my desk and pass it on to the DHL dude. Janita discovered she could go to the Sydney passport office and plead her case. Things were beginning to look up.</p>
<p>For the majority of the day we were mildly stressed, either hanging out in the passport office or sleeping in the park. We kept running into people from the gig the night before, who were shocked to see us and very sympathetic to our plight. By 4pm we both had passports, and could relax and get a decent night&#8217;s sleep before we tried once again to get to Japan.</p>
<p>The next day, we got to the airport on time and headed to Cairns without incident. When transferring flights in Cairns, we received a nice surprise on check-in. The Jetstar lady informed Janita that she had been allocated a seat in Star Class, Jetstar&#8217;s version of business class for international flights. I hadn&#8217;t been upgraded, which sucked? until the woman said, &#8220;Well, you are travelling together. I&#8217;m sure they meant to upgrade you too, so let me just fix that.&#8221;</p>
<p>We got lots of booze, decent food, free neck pillows, eye masks, constant bottles of water, reclining seats and all the fixings. We showed up at Kansai International in high spirits, and hot footed it to Kyoto.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Kyoto</h2>

<strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
7 hours of flight<br/>
7 hours of screaming child<br/>
Just SHUT UP Jaylen!  </p>
<p><strong>Alex (ii):</strong> Aleks, Jon, Joe and I got into Kyoto pretty late, devoured half a supermarket worth of onigiri and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABhai">Chu-Hi</a> and set out to find &#8220;Pretty Space &amp; Mushroom Bar&#8221;; a shoebox-sized place I&#8217;d stumbled across last time I was here with my girl. It&#8217;s all over-the-top cute, Toad (&amp; Nintendo) inspired, super colourful, with toy pianos and figurines covering every surface including the loo. The guy running the bar still wore his mushroom-y bowl cut and chubby cheeks, but didn&#8217;t offer quite the same enthused welcome to four disheveled dudes that he had showered on a small young woman in a turnip print dress (and her disproportionately tall guy) two years back.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016255/238x360-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Local store product<br/>
Chu-Hi, Slat and Meltykiss<br/>
Blendy Stick! ROFL  </p>
<p>Dear Mushroom Bar Man<br/>
Your hair is ridiculous!<br/>
I think I love you!</p>
<p><strong>Aleks (Aleks and The Ramps):</strong> We had planned on going to the Fushimi Inari shrine upon our arrival in Kyoto, and sang some shrine-related songs on the train: ?Love Potion Number Shrine?, ?Sweet Child O? Shrine?, ?The Wichita Shrinesman?, ?Shrine On, You Crazy Diamond?. Going to the Fushimi Inari shrine at night is scary as shit, and therefore one of the best things you can do while in Kyoto. Probably more so if you get blazed beforehand, which I wouldn&#8217;t really recommend. Emblazement is a pretty severe crime in Japan.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016256/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Alex:</strong> In the morning, Joe and I set out for a lightning stride through old-world Gion, up into the touristy, shriney hills, smashing several vending machine drinks on the way. We were accosted by a group of awesome kids and their teacher from Suzuka City for English questions about our favourite Japanese food and what we do for work (should&#8217;ve heard their delighted &#8220;oohs&#8221; and &#8220;ahhs&#8221; when we told them we were touring musicians). Autographs followed as well as the first of dozens of peace-sign pic times. After the gear-lug/transit strain of the night before it was pretty swell to be in postcard-y Kyoto, even for just an hour or so before the will-they/wont-they stress of Janita and Simon&#8217;s arrival set in. </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3016258/640x424-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Later, we struggled to find the venue for that night, until a serious rock dude (a sunglasses inside kind of guy) from Osaka club GANJA ACID (!) obviously recognised our rockstarness (ie. all our gear) and explained that we were just metres (but three floors) away from where we needed to be. Ramps soundchecked as a three-piece with me on sampler duties for <a href="/releases/2000758">&#8216;Bummer&#8217;</a> &#8211; fun! Urbanguild is a stunning venue. Midsized with perfect sight lines, rustic Japanese wooden furnishings and a great kitchen &#8211; so so impressive.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016257/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
After the ii set, it was obvious that Aleks&#8217; stress levels were peaking over the continued absence of two Ramps and no amount of soothing drone, cheap ciggies or Pocari Sweat would relieve him. Fortunately, with 30 minutes to go, Simon and Janita casually wandered in, saving him from probable meltdown. All rejoiced and the Ramps took the stage with the rare release and energy that comes only from making it unscathed through preposterous self-inflicted adversity. It was kind of glorious, really, and my favorite Ramps live set ever. Never seen Jon&#8217;s hair flap about so much on drums!</p>
<p><strong>Aleks:</strong> The show went unexpectedly well. There were a whole bunch of people there, and I have no idea why. Yoji And His Ghost band rule a lot. We sold a buttload of CDs/7?s, and half of the people who bought stuff insisted on us signing it too. Which was weird; maybe they thought we were really famous in Australia. This turned out to be the norm, and it happened at the other shows too. Japanese people go all out with their fandom.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>

<h2>#Sound Bar ONPA &#8211; &#8216;Soreto Music Vol. 3&#8217;: 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties, Aleks and The Ramps, ii, noid, Ningen OK</h2>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> We were a little bit psyched to see 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties play on Saturday night at Sound Bar ONPA in Kanazawa, where our show had been relocated after the original venue closed down. Some of us were a tiny bit tired too. I had several involuntary standing-up-sleeps during their set. That&#8217;s how dreamy they were. With their gorgeous flute harmonies and their outrageous vibraphone with it&#8217;s scorn for drowsiness. At some point I paid ?500 (about $6.50) for a glass of water. At some other point I woke to shimmering tambourines. At yet another point a delicate lullaby turned into a phenomenal rock-out. We were equal parts blown away, relieved that they revealed themselves to be so awesome, and truly excited to be touring Japan with them!</p>

Four Bonjours Parties<br/>
I can tell we&#8217;re going to be<br/>
Super best buddies</p>

<strong>Aleks:</strong> Kanazawa has some pretty awesome Engrish signage. My head was all sloshy from the last night&#8217;s maggotfest and the bar prices were way high (no free drinks for performers in Japan) so I stayed sober all night. In retrospect, this was probably my only sober night. I had my first ramen of the trip. It was real corny and super good. The room we played in was like a shoebox that was designed to hold only one shoe. For an amputee or something. I didn&#8217;t watch the band after us, because I needed to eat. They had way too much gear. An extra drumkit, rack cases of fancy things heaps of pedals. I thought they were going to take up the whole space and have a rehearsal while the audience just stood outside. I&#8217;m assuming they sounded like Battles.</p>

<strong>Jon:</strong> There&#8217;s something charming and old world about Kanazawa despite its modern shopping strips, unnaturally empty for a Saturday night. It&#8217;s been dubbed a ?mini Kyoto?, though even Kyoto is famously diminishing. Girls are blatant in their appraisal of the tall foreigner as Alex and I prowl the city for a different basic need: dinner. At some point, early on, I became a little preoccupied with seeing all of the bands we played with in Japan. After all, it&#8217;s not often you have a certain level of guidance in a new place populated with bands entirely unfamiliar. I even recorded most of them.</p>
<p>ii played early on, and it was probably one of our more lacklustre showings. Alex&#8217;s synth began switching off at random. I became too flustered to roll with the changes. Power supply/transformer issues continually made us nervous. The same nerves didn&#8217;t affect Aleks and The Ramps so much. Drums are so eco-friendly.</p>

<p>I had seen 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties in Japan before, but tonight was a different occasion &#8211; I now play some of the same songs with their two ?migr? members, Ayumu and Miwa, in a Melbourne band called Tailor Made for a Small Room. My eyes dampened a little as they played &#8216;Pins and Needles&#8217;, its melancholy lilt merging with vague feelings of homesickness and longing for things I could and couldn&#8217;t pinpoint.<br/>
Of the other bands, I quite liked noid. They were a melodic post-punk band that floated between slow, meditative passages and startlingly intricate math-rock bombast. Despite the cost of rehearsal studios, or perhaps because of it, Japanese bands are often very precise. They even had two drummers; something I know the folks back home would be pleased by. (And most eco-friendly!) Ningen OK didn&#8217;t sound like Battles &#8211; unfortunately. They were one of the stranger bands we saw, and one wore a mask as he danced his way through endless footswitches, each presenting a slightly different skronk. Crazy and a little pointless, like Life?.</p>

<strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Japanese peoples<br/>
May I introduce to you<br/>
Extremely short pants</p>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> Next morning we made our way to Nagoya. Obviously the hot towels and legroom of Star Class were not punishment enough for Simon, who left his Rail Pass and wallet on the Shinkansen, and had to hop on the next one and chase it to Tokyo.</p>
<p>At this moment in your life, the bullet train becomes somewhat of a handy invention. You don&#8217;t have to pay the driver extra to step on it. And anyway, you can&#8217;t because you left your wallet on the train. Ha! His wallet and rail pass miraculously found their way to Tokyo Station&#8217;s lost-and-found room. Coincidentally, 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties release their records on a label called Lost In Found. I wonder if that is like a lost-and0found where you go to find things that were never lost? That was nearly a haiku.</p>

Today our venue was in the basement of a cafe. It was an afternoon thing and we headlined at 6pm. Perfect timeslot for Yukio and Yaeko, our [Janita&#8217;s and Joe&#8217;s] Japanese step-grandparents who drove an hour- and-a-half from Gifu to be there. They greeted us with beaming, smiling faces, not to mention several bags of sushi and refreshments and cute gifts. I&#8217;ve seen some of the photos they snapped of our set (Yukio also filmed it.) We all looked incredibly tired &#8211; and we hadn&#8217;t even hit Tokyo yet (except for Simon). Oh, and we also bumped into the Japanese Geoff O&#8217;Connor at the show, fancy that!</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
How very lovely<br/>

<p><strong>Janita:</strong> I feel compelled to admit that on that same afternoon, Alex and I got hideously and humiliatingly lost within a 200-metre radius of our Nagoya ryokan [Japanese inn]. Some friendly Seven and iholdings employees helped us locate it on a giant photocopied map. At last, with much lack-of-shared-language-impaired pointing, Nos understood where to go. And then with such purpose did we strut just around a corner to check in to our place. Oh yeah, there it is! Bahahaha. Cry. At least we didn&#8217;t have any of the road cases, or Ramps, with us.</p>

After the show, we dined with 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties at a Yamachan <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya">izakaya</a>. Beers were ordered all round except for my pot of warm sake. Koji and Tomomi taught us some traditional Japanese dance moves at the dinner table. Miwa and Ayumu (4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties members presently living in Melbourne) had told the 4 Bon crew all about our choreography, and they made us promise to do the Ramps-dance at our show coming up that Friday in Shimokitazawa. We did play &#8216;Whiplash&#8217; at that show (which features said dance), and they were very excited, especially when we busted out one of their Japanese moves that we&#8217;d spliced seamlessly into our routine! </p>
