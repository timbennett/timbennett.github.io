                <h3>It&#8217;s been a vintage year for Australian music so far (check out our critics? <a href="/articles/4295308">mid-year report</a> if you&#8217;re not convinced), but there&#8217;s still plenty left in the tank for the remainder of 2011. The list below is likely to fluctuate and is by no means exhaustive, so feel free to add any omissions in the comments section below. (If we&#8217;re feeling generous we might even put them up.) In the interests of symmetry, we&#8217;ve decided to include the entire month of July.
