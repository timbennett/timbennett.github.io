Summer music festival season is upon us. Some people get really excited about this. A small minority may even visit a local music venue at some point during the year. But the band is too loud. ?D&#8217;ya wanna go to the beer garden??</p>
<p>Blink is the hairy dude in the black hoodie they squeeze past on their way to noiseless respite. He&#8217;s standing in the corner of the band room getting jiggy with his inner notebook. He&#8217;s a Kiwi. He runs a festival. He appraises and moves on. His real name is Ian Jorgensen, but all super heroes need a pseudonym. Gigs, house parties, DIY festivals, industry showcases, Blink is all ears. All in the name of furnishing something called Campus A Low Hum. He&#8217;s camp mother.</p>
<p>It began with a zine &#8211; <em>A Low Hum</em> &#8211;  progressing to taking New Zealand bands on tours. Big tours. Freezing nights in Nelson, Gisborne, Barrytown. Playing door bitch in Palmerston North. It lasted a couple of years. He saw the festival light.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s also received criticism. Lots. What the hell is he running? He doesn&#8217;t pay bands, does? It&#8217;s pay-to-play; a scam. He doesn&#8217;t announce the lineup. He&#8217;s laughing all the way to Kiwi Bank. Many bags of popcorn have been eaten in front of online music chat rooms as we&#8217;ve watched sulky indie kids bemoan his formula. Clearly the guy has some explaining to do.</p>
<p>Across the table he&#8217;s a big, wide-eyed bear. He looks slightly cornered but is excited to be talking about his festival, eager to put the record straight. His features bulge and his hands gasp around wildly for understanding. He&#8217;s got what they call a ?vision?; probably many.<br/>
The dude&#8217;s in good spirits for someone who spent the previous night hoofing it down Johnston Street in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, clinging to the back of trams and dolling out a stream of six and eight dollar cover charges, relentlessly searching out the local gold soundz. He&#8217;s here to choose Australian bands for his festival.</p>
<p>We sit in the restaurant and he talks and talks and talks. Big ideas. Justifications. You don&#8217;t even notice him eat, but he finds time for seconds. He motors on for over an hour-and-a-half before his head lowers a fraction and he finishes by saying, ?Why do people have to be such dicks? Why can&#8217;t they just let me do what I want??</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3017646/400x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>You&#8217;ve still a few stamps on your wrist from last night, bro.</strong><br/>
Yeah! Six. Nearly seven. Just missed the Primitive Calculators. The weather was against me. I&#8217;m seeing about another 60 bands while I&#8217;m Oz, and I&#8217;m back again soon to see more. I&#8217;ve got a list of about 200 Australian bands I want to see. It&#8217;s kind of like being on tour again.<br/>
That&#8217;s actually how the first Camp came about. I was sick of the tours I&#8217;d been running and wanted to announce the end of it. Get everyone together, a few of the bands I&#8217;d been touring, and throw this huge party. I always wanted to throw a party in an old scout hall, the location of the first Camp was the same scout place I used to go to as a kid &#8211; I&#8217;d always been fascinated with this idea of going back there and throwing this big party. The original concept was just five or six bands over one night, a vocal PA in a hall and that&#8217;s it. But once word got out about it every band in New Zealand wanted to play.</p>
<p><strong>And so it seems in Australia now, too.</strong><br/>
Totally! For the first Camps in 2007 and 2008 pretty much any Australian band who wanted to play got invited. Now my job is a shitload harder, with over 250 emailing me asking to play. But you know, seeing bands in Australia is really enjoyable because no one knows who I am, or what I look like. It makes such a refreshing change to not have people constantly trying to suck my dick wherever I go.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think that is? What&#8217;s so great about Camp?</strong><br/>
I guess it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s not what most people are used to. The event is pretty much a free for all. There are not the usual restrictions that most events have. It&#8217;s nothing like the music festivals most people in Australia are used too. What excites me most I guess is that so much of the event is spontaneous and unplanned so even I get a few surprises. I love just creating an environment where awesome shit can happen at anytime by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>The setting would help, I&#8217;d say. You&#8217;ve always held Camp in activity-based places, like scout camps. The first Camp featured an obstacle course, canoeing, games of cricket, races in potato sacks etc. The kids tend to go apeshit.</strong><br/>
Well that&#8217;s the aim you know, that&#8217;s what motivates me. </p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3017640/620x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>Even though the event has grown every year, one of your philosophies remains the same, and ever-controversial: no lineup announcements. Pray tell.</strong><br/>
Initially with the A Low Hum tours that was my idea. It was meant to be a Low Hum ?club night?. People weren&#8217;t meant to know who played; they were just meant to turn up each month, get their CD and magazine and see some bands. But I pussied out. I realised that I couldn&#8217;t do that because I hadn&#8217;t built a brand yet. So when I did that first Camp I realised there was no reason to announce bands, because it wasn&#8217;t a music festival, it was a Low Hum party.</p>
<p><strong>Not announcing the lineup, I guess, means you can book bands right up to the last minute, and that tickets can go on sale early. It also means punters have to invest a lot of trust in you.</strong><br/>
I was totally blown away by the criticism in the first year because it didn&#8217;t seem like a weird thing for me. I mean, I had been touring bands for four years. People are going to know my taste in music. And I mean, if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t come.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3017644/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>But what about us lil? old Aussies? We don&#8217;t necessarily know your taste in music, so why should Australian&#8217;s pay hundreds of dollars to go to Bulls, New Zealand, to see this thing called Campus a Low Hum, which they&#8217;ve never heard of, to see god-knows what bands?</strong><br/>
Well, yeah, I can understand the problem in Australia because it takes a lot more of a commitment to get over, in terms of flight costs. So they shouldn&#8217;t &#8211; not if that&#8217;s their attitude. I&#8217;ve always said it&#8217;s not about the bands, or who is or isn&#8217;t on the lineup. It&#8217;s a party, man. You&#8217;ve got to trust that I know what I&#8217;m doing, as crazy as that seems.</p>
<p><strong>So how many tickets have been sold in Australia for this shindig anyway?</strong><br/>
Quite a lot. Already around 150. And heaps of those are from Perth. That puts a lot of pressure on me. I&#8217;m thinking ?holy shit? I better make this thing good.</p>
<p><strong>And how does that make a festival organiser feel?</strong><br/>
Completely flattered. Because I would never do it in a million years, you know, going all the way from New Zealand to Perth for an event I had no idea about. But I can see the specialness of the event.<br/>
To walk into one of the rooms at Camp, and everyone is having a great time, the band is amazing, you see the smiles, you see it all working &#8211; that&#8217;s why I do it. I mean, <a href="/articles/3513404">Camp 2009</a> I hated until 7pm on the first day. I was miserable. Everything was going wrong. Things were running late, and it was a bad year with the Oz bands being so demanding. Then the Ruby Suns took to the outdoor stage under the trees, and from that moment it was fine. They played the best show of their entire career, and they&#8217;ll likely agree with that.</p>
<p><strong>Woah, wait a minute. What was that about Oz bands being demanding? We&#8217;re talking about that other controversial issue of Camp, aren&#8217;t we? Not paying bands. Were you surprised that bands actually wanted compensation for their labour?</strong><br/>
I was going to give up after 2009. It was a really hard year for me. In 2007 no one cared that I didn&#8217;t pay them. And I still lost a ton of money that year, something like $15,000.</p>
<p><strong>How did you lose so much money when you weren&#8217;t paying any bands?</strong><br/>
Well, I only got about 300 payers. I overestimated how many people would buy tickets. And you know, putting on an event like this costs money. That first one cost me nearly $60,000 to put on. The venue was around $10,000, production &#8211; PAs etc, the same, plus all the other production costs. I budgeted on getting 500 payers but I only got 300, so there you go. Paying bands is actually only a small chunk of it.  </p>
<blockquote><p>?The event is pretty much a free for all. There are not the usual restrictions that most events have. It&#8217;s nothing like the music festivals most people in Australia are used too.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>You went from not paying bands, to paying some bands to paying all bands. Why the change, are you making it up as you go?</strong><br/>
Yep. Well 2009 was where it got fucked up. In 2007 and 2008 I didn&#8217;t pay anyone, well, except maybe four bands and it was fine. No one had a bitch about it. Then in 2009 I totally made a huge mistake. In 2007 no one knew what to expect. It was what it was &#8211; a party. Then in 2008 there was more expectation. It sold out, and people started seeing it as a music festival. The following year the bands all assumed they would be getting paid. And my budget for Oz bands was about $3000 of which I had to split that between 25 bands. So some bands, higher profile ones, like My Disco, Love of Diagrams etc. got a larger chunk of their airfares paid for. A few bands got $500, a few got $200, and about 15 didn&#8217;t get a cent. So that was the problem. But you find these things out as you go along.</p>
<p><strong>You didn&#8217;t expect that bands would be pissed off when they found out their mates &#8211; or rivals &#8211; were getting paid and they weren&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
No, because the thing is it wasn&#8217;t a music festival. The bands who contacted me knew they weren&#8217;t going to get paid. They were all fine with that at the time. </p>
<p><strong>So are you taking advantage of bands who really want to play your event, and who contribute to making it a success?</strong><br/>
No, because if they don&#8217;t want to, they shouldn&#8217;t do it. But playing Camp does help Australian bands. A band like Ouch My Face! for example, if they had come over to New Zealand and done their own tour, they would have lost a ton of money. But to play Camp, they were instantly playing to 1000 people.</p>
<p><strong>But you were still effectively getting very cheap, or free labour from these bands, for your event.</strong><br/>
2009 was a blunder, I&#8217;ll admit it. I should have paid all the Oz bands the same amount. I changed that in 2010; every band got $400. That&#8217;s going to increase to $500 next year. And I moved the event into February for the Australian bands, because airfares are cheaper then. And the Aussie bands are getting more than the Kiwi bands now. Bands who have to travel from Auckland are still only getting about $300. And all the bands from Auckland who play are way more popular in New Zealand than any of the Aussie bands. I pay as much as the Big Day Out for Australian acts of a similar profile. And it&#8217;s a lot more than if the Aussie bands do a normal tour show in New Zealand. I mean, how many unheard of Aussie bands are going to make 500 bucks out of a show in New Zealand?</p>
