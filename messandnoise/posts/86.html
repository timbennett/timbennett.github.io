                <p>#SXSW Part 1: The L.A. Connection</p>
<p>South by South West is about to officially kick off in Austin, Texas, but a few Australian bands have already been kicking about Los Angeles. On Monday night the iconic indie club The Troubadour played host to several Aussies including Beasts of Bourbon, Children Collide, The Panda Band and Mink.</p>
<p>The standout: Children Collide seem to have a real buzz about them right now and<br/>
played a solid set. I&#8217;m told there were a few reps from US labels in the crowd who came<br/>
only to watch them and left after Johnny and Heath finished up.</p>
<p>For those who did stick around? Tex Perkins proved why he is one of the greats of Aussie rock with a solid performance that the small but relatively enthusiastic crowd ate up. One of the more curious parts of the evening was seeing Henry Rollins standing up the front, but hey, I guess this is L.A?</p>
<p>Youth Group arrived last week and have been playing shows around the US, which are either selling out or coming pretty dam close. Dappled Cities Fly are also over here playing at the Silverlake Lounge (it&#8217;s kind of like the Annandale in Sydney) and the Troubadour.</p>
<p>Now they may not be Aussie locals but they&#8217;re good so we&#8217;ll claim them anyway: Auckland band Cut Off Your Hands (former Shaky Hands &#8211; they had to have a name change because a US band had already claimed it) played at Safari Sams with three other US bands. The gig was pitched as a USA vs. NZ thing which if I was a local I&#8217;d be slightly embarrassed by. The three US bands were boring and tiresome in comparison to the energy and talent of the Kiwi crew. These guys will definitely turn heads at SXSW.</p>
<p>Another cross Tasman standout is a band by the name of So So Modern. It&#8217;s the first time the foursome (which includes three synths) have played outside New Zealand and although a little nervous they played a great set. Their sound is a modern take on the Devo thing and the Spectrum crowd in Sydney will eat them up.</p>
<p>But the real deal is about to begin as everyone descends on Austin. It&#8217;s hell competitive over here and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see which Aussie acts can carve out some kind of name amongst the vast sea of indie talent.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>#SXSW Part 2: It Begins</p>
<p>It must be a little intimidating if you&#8217;re an Aussie band trying to make it at SXSW. There are hundreds of bands playing at any one time and while most of them are shit, there is enough talent here to make it competitive. The Aussie Hoe Down was a chance for everyone to drink free beer and catch up, although I think there were more Yanks than Australians in the crowd. It wasn&#8217;t only industry types there: Tex Perkins, Dallas Crane and The Panda Band all showed up, as well as a very tired Mink (they had literally just arrived after a drive through the desert).</p>
<p>Expatriate played an early-ish set at 9pm at Red 7: they were good, definitely not as energetic as I&#8217;ve seen them deliver before. Ben wasn&#8217;t as theatrical as he can be, but the room filled and by the end of the gig there were around 100 punters who were bobbing their heads around.</p>
<p>Children Collide played at midnight and according to them gave one of their best shows. They had heaps of energy in their own grungy kind of way and have generated quite a bit of interest from US labels. A few locals even knew the words to ?We Are Amphibious? and were happy to sing along. The founder of Flying Nun, the label imprint they&#8217;re signed to in Australia, was also in the crowd and really enjoyed their set. Roger Shepherd no longer has anything official to do with the label after it was sold to Warner Music, but his opinion is still very much valued.</p>
<p>The Mint Chicks finished off the evening at Red 7. They were typically energetic, jumping around the stage, throwing mic stands in the air, etc. The room was busier for them than anyone else, but the show its self felt like a showcase and not really a great gig. But hey this is SXSW, the world&#8217;s biggest music? um? showcase.</p>
<p>Macromantics played a gig earlier in the day at around five at Creekside Lounge. She had a few sound issues to begin with, which has been an ongoing problem for any performer here no matter how prominent they are. There were around fifty or so people in the crowd who seemed to get into it.</p>
<p>The schedule continues to get more and more clogged with quality music. The day parties start at around one and then the showcases kick off later in the evening. If you don&#8217;t enjoy something straight away, you move on. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see which Aussie bands are able to impress an extremely impatient and spoiled audience.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>#SXSW Part 3: Add It Up</p>
<p>Life is getting very hectic here in Austin with the daily parties showcasing up to five or six bands and the nighttime venues filling to the brim if the band is deemed ?hot? enough.</p>
<p>After a 30 hour drive from LA to Austin, Youth Group played their first gigs at one the Filter parties, which is held one of the best venues around town. When I first saw them the first thing that popped into my mind was that they looked like shit and you could tell they&#8217;d been in the car for a while? If I was their manager I would have been a little<br/>
concerned.</p>
<p>But there was no need. The gig was one of the best I&#8217;ve seen so far (including the international acts) with the sound perfect and Toby&#8217;s voice resonating throughout the courtyard. Yes, they were blessed with great sound; yes, they pulled a crowd of well over 400 people; no, they didn&#8217;t play ?Forever Young?. Having an already established deal with an American label (Epitaph) obviously makes a difference in terms of being known, but Youth Group are definitely one of the most popular Australian bands playing at SXSW.</p>
<p>The Presets played at the crowd-friendly time of 1am. They had some high profile internationals on before them which boosted numbers, but they can take full credit for making the room go crazy. Another Australian who&#8217;s over here remarked that it was like watching them play a gig in Sydney, given the amount of ?cool kids? who flocked to see them.</p>
<p>Youth Group, The Presets and Architecture In Helsinki are the Aussie bands pulling the biggest crowds. All are playing at great venues and have popular internationals alongside them on the bill, but it goes to show that coming to SXSW with a deal already signed sets you on a different path to those arriving looking for a label. The Australian BBQ is on today and that will be a good indication of what bands are pulling what crowds &#8211; and who they&#8217;re comprised of &#8211; on a more even playing field.</p>
<p>In terms of making it in the States it&#8217;s hard to go past this: marketers were handing out free video game console guitars (there&#8217;s a ridiculous amount of free shit circulating at SXSW) and Wolfmother&#8217;s ?Woman? is one of the built-in songs. You really know you&#8217;ve made it when your song is featured on a kid&#8217;s toy? Rock &amp; roll!</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>#SXSW Part 4: It&#8217;s Raining (A+R) Men</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a hectic couple of days in Austin, with everyone already exhausted but determined to get as much out of SXSW &#8211; whatever their prerogative &#8211; as humanly possible. The Australian Music Collective hosted the Aussie BBQ, which was in a prominent location across the road from the convention centre and even those who weren&#8217;t invited were able to catch a bit of the Australian sound.</p>
<p>A lot of the larger markets (UK and Canada) host similar events, with the aim being to give U.S. labels a chance to peruse and network &#8211; with free booze and food &#8211; with as many bands as possible in the one space. There were a long list of Aussie bands showcasing, including Dallas Crane, Children Collide, You Am I, Expatriate, Spod, Hoodoo Gurus, Mink, Beasts of Bourbon and Wolf &amp; Cub.</p>
<p>The free sausages were flowing and by the end of the day more than six thousand people had passed through the gates, although how many were from US labels or just Australians wanting a free meal remains to be seen. The biggest crowd pullers were the veteran acts: Hoodoo Gurus and Beasts of Bourbon.</p>
<p>Airbourne have been one of the more talked about bands coming over here after they recently lost their US label deal with the downsizing major Capitol/EMI. The Warnambool quartet has a lot riding on this week. If they don&#8217;t impress the right people their latest album may struggle to see the light of day outside Australia.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to say I don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;m never sure if they&#8217;re doing an AC/DC pisstake or really believe in their music, while the constant headbanging and high-pitched screaming, even between songs, drives me insane. That said, the crowd of around 250 (they completely filled the room and there was a long line out the front waiting to get in) absolutely went crazy with nearly everyone throwing their hands in the air. I even saw a few punters pull out the air guitar.</p>
<p>Lead singer Joel O&#8217;Keefe was having the time of his life. He wandered into the crowd with his cordless guitar and also jumped up on to the bar and was mashing cans of beer over the audience. Out of all the Australian acts I&#8217;ve seen these guys definitely had the most fun on stage and got the best crowd reaction. Can their live show get them a label deal? Who knows?</p>
<p>You Am I played at the Dirty Dog Bar on 6th street at eleven on the Friday night. The large room was almost full, although Tim Rogers refused to take credit calling his group magpies because they were stealing from the two high-profile international acts on after them (Sloan and The Apples In Stereo)</p>
<p>I was only able to stay for a few songs but from what I saw the set was as good as any set I&#8217;ve ever seen them play. You Am I always put on a great rock &amp; roll. There&#8217;s one more main day of music to go and several Australians have their showcases tonight including Beasts of Bourbon and Youth Group, who are both closing their venues for the evening. Several other bands are playing at day parties, but for those who haven&#8217;t got any more gigs to play here at SXSW it&#8217;s just a matter of waiting to see what, if anything, has been achieved.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>#SXSW Part 5: The Dust Settles</p>
<p>South By South West has officially ended for another year. Austin is looking like a normal city again, the streets are no longer clogged with indie kids, the sound of drums is not resonating throughout the air and people are walking around drinking coffee instead of beer.</p>
<p>Back tracking a little? Sunday morning was a good time to be Josh Pyke. The Sydney singer-songwriter woke up to the news that his debut album <em>Memories &amp; Dust</em> had entered the ARIA charts at number four. He celebrated by playing an acoustic set outside a shopping mall, an event put on by Austrade.</p>
<p>Now to the important part of the entire showcase: the fallout. Normally it takes a little while for any solid deals to be made, but it&#8217;s the ?interest? level that record companies will now be scrutinising. I&#8217;ve heard Airbourne came to the attention of a few US labels, which will be a huge relief for them after recently being dropped internationally by Capitol/EMI.</p>
<p>Dappled Cities Fly weren&#8217;t on the official showcase list, but were bought over here by their America label, Dangerbird. They played a few gigs with mixed success, but will be walking away satisfied because a label in Japan is interested in signing them. Children Collide have done really well for themselves with a lot of interest from US labels. They have a really solid team working for them and are playing shows around the States and in the UK and it looks like it&#8217;s going to pay off.</p>
<p>In fact most bands playing over here will have made some sort of progress for themselves. Even smaller artists like Spod had people at his shows and was able to meet and greet with people in the industry who could potentially enhance their careers. I was talking to a few people about their thoughts on the Aussie contingent this year and the consensus was no bands playing at this year&#8217;s showcase have the ?wow? factor that Jet or Wolfmother had/have.</p>
<p>The Australian Government contributes money (many would argue not nearly enough) into promoting Australian music at SXSW. It&#8217;s fair to say even if a band doesn&#8217;t necessarily secure that lucrative deal that will launch their careers over here, they can  gain exposure and experience in the US market impossible to normally claim from Australia.</p>
<p>For many it&#8217;s not over yet. Showcases are being held in New York over the next few days and bands will once again get an opportunity to try and impress US audiences. That&#8217;s it from Austin, Texas. Thank God it only happens once a year?</p>

<p>#SXSW Part 6: Wha&#8217; Happened?</p>
<p>As the dust settles and flights depart, a selection of Australian artists reflect on their experiences at SXSW.</p>
<p><strong>Ben King (Expatriate)</strong></p>
<p><em>What opportunities does coming to a place like this give you?</em></p>
<p>It exposes you to many, many people. There are people from all around the world, not just North America. There are people from Japan, the UK, South America, everywhere. There are radio stations; there are A&amp;R guys from record labels, publishers, touring people. There&#8217;s a plethora of things that you know as a band you&#8217;ve got to get: a booking agent, a record deal, a publisher? For one week every year they&#8217;re all here under the one sun.</p>
<p><em>When people think if SXSW they think it&#8217;s just one crazy party week, is that the case?</em></p>
<p>You kind of have to put your mind into both things, you need to switch it up because when you&#8217;re showcasing you&#8217;ve got to be on it. You&#8217;ve only got two or three shows here for the week and if you want to think about it, they&#8217;re the biggest shows of your career so far. So there&#8217;s a little bit of pressure. But you know you just have to have fun at the same time and not worry about all that shit. The best thing a band can do is play a great show and put across what you&#8217;re about &#8211; as long as you do that you can leave here knowing that you&#8217;ve done your best.</p>
<p><em>Do you think bands coming to SXSW is money well spent?</em></p>
<p>The tyranny of distance has always been hard for Australian bands. There are bands here that have come from Huston, we&#8217;ve come from Sydney. This is the right place and the right time to spend money on artists who are trying to make something of themselves overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Edwards (Wolf &amp; Cub)</strong></p>
<p><em>What were your expectations of SXSW?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. I just expected a party and just to see some friends as well, because we haven&#8217;t seen many people from Australia since we left home a few months ago.</p>
<p><em>Do you think the festival is more about having a good time or business?</em></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a good combination. Apparently a lot of important people are there to see you, but the vibe is out to have a good time &#8211; good time gigs, good weather, good food?</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s been the strangest thing you&#8217;ve seen since you got here?</em></p>
<p>I got home last night at 3am and I saw two naked girls in my spa.</p>
<p><em>What has your band gotten out of SXSW besides a hangover?</em></p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll find out when we get home and read the reviews and get the feedback. But I guess it was our first experience in America, which was kind of daunting before we got here but now it&#8217;s like just another territory really. I guess we&#8217;ve got that out of the way now and because we&#8217;ve been introduced we can come back again.</p>
<p><em>What do you want to get of this week?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be great to get a US or European promoter. The main thing is to get gig and tours overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Spod</strong></p>
<p><em>What were your expectation coming here?</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really have any. All I wanted to do was play the shows and meet a few people, hopefully meet a few bands over here, US bands, and just to try and play more here because there&#8217;s such a touring circuit.</p>
<p><em>In a business sense what have you gotten out of it?</em></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t really know until it&#8217;s all over. I mean to get some touring. Maybe management, because at the moment I&#8217;m between managers and labels, so I&#8217;m looking at Australian management and everything. But I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of people so we&#8217;ll see what happens in the end of it all.</p>
<p><em>If you could give yourself one piece of advice before you came here what would it be?</em></p>
<p>Have six assistants for a year before I came over so I&#8217;d be better prepared, because it&#8217;s pretty much just me doing everything at the moment. I&#8217;m doing a new album so my time has been stretched. I don&#8217;t feel as prepared as I&#8217;d like to, but it&#8217;s panning out really well.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the weirdest thing you&#8217;ve seen in America?</em></p>
<p>I had a guy try to get me high and suck my dick in Los Angeles. That was interesting. And this lady who had a head three feet wide wanting me to take photos of her breasts and following me around. L.A. &#8211; it&#8217;s a heavy town, but I kind of liked it.</p>
