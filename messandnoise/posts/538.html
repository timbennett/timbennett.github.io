                <h3>In the wake of last night&#8217;s closure, <strong>BEN SALTER</strong> reflects on The Troubadour&#8217;s legacy, how it gave birth to The Gin Club, and his fears for the Valley in its absence
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016070/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I don&#8217;t even know how long it&#8217;s been since The Troubadour opened now. I lost track around the third of fourth birthday party. There was one I missed where it was reported a sleeping reveller awoke to find himself being rotated slowly from below, nose inches from the ceiling.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this and you haven&#8217;t ever visited, it&#8217;s kind of like the waiting room in a fancy illegal gambling den, tastefully outfitted and flatteringly lit. Back in the day, The Valley was a place apart, populated mostly by musicians, bums, junkies and crooks. But roughly in tandem to The Troubadour&#8217;s lifespan, Fortitude Valley has increasingly become the preferred destination for the ?city? crowd &#8211; yuppies, dickheads, bogans, weekend ravers &#8211; who have been lured away from the city by the mega clubs that encircle the Brunswick Street Mall. And so The Troubadour has always been a bastion; an enclave of (relative) dignity and taste, a haven from the escalating madness that almost nightly takes place on the pavement outside.</p>

<p>Sometime around 2003, Marty Brown and Jamie Trevaskis came to see Conor Macdonald and I play solo sets at Ric&#8217;s, a ?Cheeseboard? Saturday afternoon show as I recall. I still have a recording of Conor. They said they were opening a venue across the road and they wanted us to come and play the opening night. Which was a lovely offer &#8211; but I remember thinking they must have been dodgy, that this would be yet another enthusiastically devised but short lived attempt at establishing a live music venue in Brisbane, where the spirit is willing but the flesh is sometimes weak.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how Jamie and Marty came to be there but they were into all the same stuff as we were &#8211; disturbingly so for snobs like us &#8211; and so of course we agreed to do the gig. We were just happy to have somewhere to play. So a week later Conor and myself, along with Adrian Stoyles, fronted up across the street, up the stairs above the Cosmopolitan Cafe into what had been a succession burnt-out nightclubs, to play at the Troubadour; and our seven-year love affair with the place began.</p>
<p>There was no Gin Club then, just a bunch of us who had met each other at an open mic night and were starting to get drunk together and hatch plans. We were in cahoots. It was Jamie and Corrina who gave us our name &#8211; after that first night, all of us began performing at the Troubadour in ones, twos, threes, fours, as well as just hanging about the place and drinking. We dabbled with the truly ghastly name ?The Digital Void? for one show &#8211; it was soon abandoned. Then one night at yet another group performance, Jamie scrawled ?The Gin Club? in chalk out the front, a reference to the gallons of the stuff we were putting away at the time. I just liked it cause it looked a bit like ?The Gun Club?. It stuck.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3016074/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The Gin Club played our first show with Tim Rogers there, where he got up and sang ?Sweet Virginia? and ?Shine A Light? with us. We played with Laura Veirs. We drank ?Troubadour Shots? with Will Oldham and the Sweeney brothers. (For those not in the know, a Troubadour shot is a shot of tequila chased with a mini Virgin Mary in a shot glass. They&#8217;re amazing.) We did about 20 photo shoots there. Giants of Science filmed a clip there. We used to smoke in the place. It&#8217;s hard to imagine now. On stage. So many amazing shows. The Horrortones. Midget with Screamfeeder. The Spoils with Nauto on drums doing a Velvet Underground tribute. Smog. Jamie&#8217;s beloved Mark Kozelek, really sick and grumpy as hell. The Lou Barlow show, that I missed, along with the Crooked Fingers show. Jason Molina. I must have played there a hundred times.</p>
<blockquote><p>?[We] were lucky enough to be there at the start, hanging about, cadging drinks, DJing, swooping on support slots like vultures, even crawling around in the roof one day helping to install power points for the new stage.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Whole tight-knit scenes of musicians, friends and fans have loved and lost between The Troubadour&#8217;s splendidly decorated walls. They have worked in concert with the space so lovingly created by Jamie, Corrina and Marty to create lasting memories and moments. That&#8217;s something no one should take for granted. The Gin Club, and myself, were lucky enough to be there at the start, hanging about, cadging drinks, DJing, swooping on support slots like vultures, even crawling around in the roof one day helping to install power points for the new stage. But since then, successive waves of bands and solo artists and fans have taken up the mantle, called the place home, fallen under the its spell.</p>
<p>And now it has come to an end. But I am not too sad about it. Things change. All things must pass. And despite our suspension of disbelief, on Friday and Saturday nights at least, Fortitude Valley has become an unbearable environment, particularly for a place with the sensibilities of The Troubadour. The venue business is fraught with difficulty at the best of times, and requires a massive personal commitment. The fact that the place lasted as long as it did is a testament to Jamie Trevaskis, Corrina Scanlon and Marty Brown&#8217;s original vision. I have no doubt that The Troubadour&#8217;s legacy will live large in the memories of Brisbane and Australian musicians and fans for many years to come.</p>
