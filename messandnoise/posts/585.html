                <h3>A belated interview with Tim Morrissey of Brisbane&#8217;s The John Steel Singers. Words by <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.

<p/>
<p>?We&#8217;ve been told to be prepared to be on the road for upwards of a year,? The John Steel Singers? Tim Morrissey told us in an interview in late 2010; a couple weeks out from the release of the band&#8217;s debut LP, the Robert Forster-produced <em>Tangalooma*. A few months on, and he&#8217;s living up to his word. The Brisbane six-piece is about to embark on the ?Here&#8217;s Johnny? <a href="/news/4191140">co-headline tour</a> of Australia with Modular wunderkind Jonathan Boulet. Ahead of the tour, which starts in Byron Bay tomorrow (March 9), we thought we&#8217;d trot out this previously unpublished interview, during which Morrissey discusses Forster&#8217;s studio quirks, the band&#8217;s lyrical influences and his appreciation of English post-punk act Wire. He also revealed that the long gestation period of *Tangalooma</em> meant they had a batch of new material ready to go &#8211; just don&#8217;t expect any horns.</p>
<p>?None of the news tracks have horns yet, but I&#8217;m not ruling it out or anything,? said Morrissey. ?We&#8217;ve written quite a lot of material &#8211; if someone sent us into the studio next month I&#8217;d be ready for it.?</p>
<p><strong>Were you going for a baroque pop feel on <em>Tangalooma</em>?</strong><br/>
Definitely. We&#8217;re all big fans of pop. Robert as well, he&#8217;s a  big influence &#8211; he&#8217;s got such a great pop mind. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever been afraid of being labeled a pop band. That&#8217;s what I would label us, I guess. That&#8217;s the sort of music that I really like to make: good three, four minute pop songs, but I like that we can offset that with &#8211; for a lack of a better word &#8211; jammy songs. It&#8217;s good being able to listen to a band like Wire, who can put a song like ?Outdoor Miner? next to a seven-minute jam song that has the same repetitive riff that builds and gets noisier and noisier, and then you have a three-minute pop song after that. Listening to their albums gave us that confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Wire doesn&#8217;t seem like an obvious reference point.</strong><br/>
There are certain things from Wire that&#8217;s influenced us, perhaps it&#8217;s not super obvious, but you can&#8217;t get a more picture pop song that ?Outdoor Miner?. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing that doesn&#8217;t need to be there in terms of arrangement or instrumentation, and the melody is perfect &#8211; I guess there are a few influences on the album that people wouldn&#8217;t see the correlation between.</p>
<p><strong>I guess Wire followed up that album [<em>Chairs Missing*] with something like *154</em>, which is totally out-there and experimental.</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t go maybe two or three days without listening to that album. There&#8217;s a track on there, ?Map Ref. 41?N 93?W?, that&#8217;s influenced this album a lot. It sort of sits in between these dirge-y post-punk songs.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Wire kept reinventing themselves through each album. Is that a career trajectory that you plan to follow?</strong><br/>
I would certainly love if we could come anywhere near what that band did. [<em>Laughs</em>] When you listen to our earlier stuff, if you compare ?Strawberry Wine? to ?Rainbow Kraut?, they&#8217;re two different entities &#8211; We don&#8217;t feel any constriction to adhere to any particular type of song. We feel free to be able to write what ever we want, and arrange it any way we want.</p>
<p><strong>I guess Robert hit the nail on the head when he called your band ?adventurous?. What did you make of that?</strong><br/>
I wish I remembered that in my last two interviews with country newspaper who asked me what genre we were. [<em>Laughs</em>] But adventurous pop group is perfect actually. I&#8217;m going to tell that to everyone. But, yeah, that&#8217;s a massive compliment. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d like us to be summed up.</p>
<p><strong>He also said you were going to release six great albums.</strong><br/>
I heard that, and I really like that idea &#8211; Coming from a person like him, it&#8217;s a large compliment. We get on pretty well as a band, and I hope we keep doing different things with every album. There are some bands who can get stuck writing the same songs over and over again. I think we&#8217;ve already escaped that, and that we&#8217;ve got many different possibilities to explore in the future.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to go back to the history of the band. You and Scott met a restaurant?</strong><br/>
We both worked at a restaurant in Brisbane. There was a gig coming up and I asked Scott if he was going to that, and then we started talking about music. We shared a love of a lot of similar bands. Eventually we got together to play music &#8211; he&#8217;s the one that started teaching me guitar. It went from there. I always wanted to be in a band for as long as I can remember, but I never actually learned an instrument. I was always writing songs in my head and making hypothetical band members out of people that I&#8217;d met. It was only when I met him [Scott] that everything came together. We shared the same love of similar bands, Wire being one of those bands. He taught me the guitar and it evolved from there.</p>
<p><strong>You must&#8217;ve had some pretty grand ambitions to recruit four more people.</strong><br/>
That was never intentional to be honest. It just came about. It was Scott and I, and then we got Ross [Chandler] to play drums. We eventually recruited Pete [Bernoth] to play the keyboards. We realised we needed a bass player, so we got a friend Conan [Thorogood] in to play the bass, but he had to leave to go on a world tour with The Grates. We got Pat [McDermott] in, and we had him for about four years until recently. Six months after the band had already been going, we brought in [guitarist] Luke [McDonald]. It was never our intention to groom six members &#8211; I thought it was all pretty big at five &#8211; but then we started jamming with Luke and thought, ?This guy&#8217;s great, we need to get him in?, and I was terrible at guitar. With the brass thing, we never really knew Pete could play. It was like, ?Oh, you play trombone? Bring it in, we&#8217;ll put it in somewhere.? It was the similar thing with Scott, who plays trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>How do you manage so many voices in the studio?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s definitely evolving. Scott and I used to write all the songs and bring them to the band to flesh them out &#8211; Now it&#8217;s a lot more organic. We bring in songs in their infancy and let everyone flesh the parts out all together as a band. It&#8217;s good to have someone like Robert in the studio, because he&#8217;s that authoritative voice that everyone trusts. You might be attached to a guitar part, you might&#8217;ve played it for a year, but when someone like Robert comes in and says, ?Look, you don&#8217;t need to be playing that part?, you listen, rather than if it comes from within the band.</p>
<p><strong>Does Scott still write the bulk of the lyrics?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Scott&#8217;s a much better wordsmith than I am. In a lot of senses, because we&#8217;re the same age, we&#8217;ve been experiencing similar sorts of issues and ideas &#8211; There are a few songs where I&#8217;ve done lyrics, but the ones with better words are Tim&#8217;s. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>And he&#8217;s been reading [psychoanalytic anthropologist] Ernest Becker?</strong><br/>
I think we both have. I&#8217;m actually re-reading him again at the moment. We&#8217;re both going through similar anxieties, I assume everyone goes through them, like worrying about death, that sort of thing. That was the muse, I guess, for a lot of the lyrics. There&#8217;s a rough theme of the album, and that&#8217;s where a lot of that came from. Ernest Becker summed up a lot of things we were feeling at the time. It&#8217;s hard to talk about, because I don&#8217;t want to sound like a wanker! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Am I right in guessing you&#8217;re both in your mid-20s?</strong><br/>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s just that those themes tend to pop up particularly at that age.</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re both white, middle-class, we live in nice houses in Brisbane and lead pretty happy lives, but you want to write about something that&#8217;s real. I guess that was what was affecting us. We don&#8217;t necessarily have depression to write about, or how we&#8217;ve had it so hard, because we haven&#8217;t. We wanted to write about something real, and [mortality] is something that&#8217;s affected every single person on the planet at some stage of their life &#8211; even if they don&#8217;t think it has.</p>

<strong>How did Tangalooma, the place, inform the record?</strong><br/>
For the album cover artwork I wanted something from the Brisbane area. I wanted to own being from Brisbane a little bit &#8211; It [Tangalooma] is a place I visited when I was younger and I saw the shipwrecks there. They just stuck with me. I think I was three when I first saw those shipwrecks, and didn&#8217;t go back for another 23 years. That image stayed perfectly in my mind that whole time. They just have such an otherworldly feel to them, just sitting in that tropical paradise. Thankfully, we got a day when we took the photos that we had clear water and no clouds in the sky. It was just awesome &#8211; those big, rusted shipwrecks poking out of this pristine environment. It&#8217;s got an otherworldly feel to it that sums up the album, and there&#8217;s a bit of sentimentality about it as well.</p>
<p><strong>How about the horse heads?</strong><br/>
I guess it ties back to the band name. John Steel is the name of a little plastic horse that we had &#8211; it&#8217;d come around with us to gigs. We probably got a little carried away over the years continuing with that horse theme. We had a horse on the front of our first EP, and it gradually grew from there. When we were touring the UK last year, I saw those horse heads and thought they&#8217;d work really well on the album cover. We ended up buying like 14 of them. It&#8217;s really got nothing to do with anything &#8211; it&#8217;s probably getting a little bit ridiculous now.</p>
<p><strong>There seems to be an embrace of indie-pop in Brisbane that&#8217;s not really happening anywhere else [in Australia].</strong><br/>
It does seem like that. When you read gig reviews in streetpress up here, there does tend to be that bouncy, happy pop vibe bandied about a little bit. But it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a scene built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Does it have anything to do with The Go-Betweens casting a reasonably long shadow over the city?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s definitely a bit of that. There&#8217;s that idea that there&#8217;s a Brisbane sound: a trebly guitar straight into the amp. Bands like The Apartments or the Ups and Downs &#8211; and Custard as well. Some people think the weather influences how a band sounds &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if that has anything to do with it. I know David Byrne did a fairly interesting thing about how venues can influence the way people write music. How Mozart was writing music for certain rooms, or other people were writing for churches, which have that big reverb-y sound.</p>
<p><strong>I take it you don&#8217;t write songs for Ric&#8217;s [Bar].</strong><br/>
No, but I have to admit that in the early days, all I really wanted to do was play Ric&#8217;s on a Saturday night. You know, it felt like you were getting somewhere if you played Ric&#8217;s on a Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s where you met Grant McLennan?</strong><br/>
Yes I did, actually. I think it was maybe our third show. Grant come up to me after the show and complimented me on the set. He said, ?The only think I&#8217;d reconsider is having two keyboards in the band.? He came back five minutes later and said, ?Look, don&#8217;t listen to an idiot like me, you do whatever you want. Have those two keyboards!? The whole time I stood there mouth agape, I didn&#8217;t really respond. The days after, I had all these things I wish I said. Sadly, it was only a couple weeks before he passed away. It was an odd and surreal feeling, but I&#8217;m really glad that I got to meet him as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We don&#8217;t feel any constriction to adhere to any particular type of song. We feel free to be able to write what ever we want, and arrange it any way we want.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>When did Robert [Forster] come into the picture?</strong><br/>
I know he&#8217;d been a little bit of a fan before. We recorded our EP at the same place The Go-Betweens had done some demos at Mount Nebo, and the engineer gave stuff to Robert and he really liked it. I supposed we really got in contact with him at a fire and flood benefit up here [in 2009]. It was all put together at the last minute at the Tivoli. Glenn Thompson and Adele Pickvance couldn&#8217;t make the show, so he contacted us to be his backing band. It was like, ?Oh my god, that&#8217;s one of my favourite venues, playing Go-Betweens songs with Robert Forster.? It was absolutely ridiculous. We had a few rehearsals and that&#8217;s where we got to know him well. It was maybe one of our manager&#8217;s suggestions to get Robert as a producer on the album. We thought it was a fantastic idea. Robert was keen for it, and that&#8217;s how it came together.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between someone like Robert and Scott Horscroft, who produced the <em>In Colour</em> EP.</strong><br/>
They&#8217;re both wildly eccentric in their own ways &#8211; Robert was more involved with the songs and how they were coming together, whereas Scott just engineered and mixed the album. We just recorded it as is. I guess we didn&#8217;t have much time to record that EP with him. We did it in two days. Robert was more about the songs, how to arrange the songs. He was really good at trimming the fat. With six people you can get pretty bloated with instrumentation, and that&#8217;s before the overdubs. He was really good at trimming the fat and being an authority figure.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favourite Robert Forster anecdote?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a lot of them. When we were tracking the live takes down in Melbourne [at Sing Sing], he&#8217;d stand in the middle of the room composed. You knew when the take was getting good when he started dancing. When it [the dancing] got more rigorous you know it was a good take. As soon as the take would finish, he&#8217;d throw the cans off onto the floor &#8211; he was very eccentric in this manner &#8211; and say, ?That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the take. Print it.? And then it&#8217;d be onto the next thing. He&#8217;s a bit crazy like that, but in a good way. He&#8217;s a very funny guy as well.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting you came down to Melbourne for the tracking given you wanted to make a Brisbane record.</strong><br/>
That came about through scheduling issues. We were originally going to record it in the Old Museum up here. We were still independent at that stage and the funds hadn&#8217;t come through, or we had gone over budget &#8211; We had to push it back to a time when the Old Museum wasn&#8217;t available. We had to find somewhere else, and we needed somewhere where we could track as a full band and then take elsewhere. Sing Sing was available, so we went there for 10 days. That ended up working really well, because it&#8217;s a great studio. I was a bit worried it&#8217;d be one of those shmick, clean, nice studios but it&#8217;s really old and there&#8217;s heaps of old vintage gear in there. </p>
<p><strong>So a bit of Melbourne has seeped onto the record?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a little bit of Melbourne there, definitely. [<em>Laughs</em>] But not too much.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan on staying in Brisbane?</strong><br/>
As long as we&#8217;re in Australia, I&#8217;ll stay in Brisbane. It&#8217;s affordable and nice. When I have <a href="/news/3506579">interstate] bands crashing at my house in Brisbane, they&#8217;re always amazed at what you can get for $100 a week rent as compared to what you can get in Sydney or Melbourne. I&#8217;ve always wanted to go overseas with the band, and relocate somewhere else. We might go somewhere and fall flat on our faces and maybe get a sweet <em>Mess+Noise* article like [Sparkadia</a> and <a href="/news/3574156">Temper Trap</a>, but hopefully not. [*Laughs</em>] We want to go experience living overseas and playing to different people, but I think we&#8217;re all aware that we could be back here within four or five months after we did that. Still, it&#8217;s definitely an ambition that we have.</p>
<p><strong>Will you follow the Go-Betweens? lead and go to London?</strong><br/>
I think we&#8217;ll go wherever&#8217;s more receptive. We&#8217;ll see what happens, it&#8217;s up in the air at the moment, but definitely somewhere. Where did Sparkadia go again?</p>
