                <h3>For the first time in our collective histories, &#8216;M+N&#8217; paired up with Aunty Meredith &#8211; the matriarch behind the Meredith and Golden Plains festivals in Victoria &#8211; for a 30-minute <a href="/discussions/4362039">live forum chat</a> last month. As promised, here are all your questions answered, plus a few curly ones Aunty didn&#8217;t get around to on the day. Photos by <strong>LEAH ROBERTSON<em>* and *</em>KRISTY MILLIKEN</strong>.

<p/>
<h2>The line-up</h2>
<p><strong>The most important question of all: why no Archers Of Loaf for Golden Plains?</strong><br/>
Archers Of Loaf? Well, they stuck a needle in my backbone. Maybe one day, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Will you ever get Jonathan Richman to play? I think the whole of <em>M+N</em> have been requesting it for years now.</strong><br/>
We try all the time for J Richman. There are specific criteria around how that might happen, both from him, and from other interests. We&#8217;ll keep trying. It&#8217;s kind of the holy grail right now.</p>
<p><strong>Of the bands that you&#8217;ve snagged for the festival, which required the most courting?</strong><br/>
Well, we needed to make sure KISStroyer&#8217;s dressing room didn&#8217;t require them to walk on open ground to get to stage, as their silver boots aren&#8217;t insured for mud damage.</p>
<p><strong>Can you book Dean and Britta and Damon and Naomi on the same bill without telling them that the other two people are playing as well? And make a Galaxie 500 reunion?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ll file that idea for another year, thank you. I love it!</p>
<p><strong>What prompted you to bank on the enduring appeal of Icehouse?</strong><br/>
I really like Icehouse, always have. It just seemed like a good idea, we asked them, they said yes. I like surprises. Sometimes you have to change the channel at the festival &#8211; three days of music requires it.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_xYQBTwP3t0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Have any bands broken your heart? Ones that you came painstakingly close to confirming, but then slipped away?</strong><br/>
Every year there&#8217;s a band or two that don&#8217;t confirm, or drop off at the last minute. It really hurts, especially if they are perfect for a certain time of day or night. Last year we had three major rock bands that all fell over, one by one. That really hurt. But you get over it in a day or two, and start looking for the next idea.</p>
<p><strong>Roughly what percentage of the lineup do you pick from bands that apply via email?</strong><br/>
Hardly any, to be honest. Bands tend to get so good/big so quick these years that it&#8217;s rare for a band not to have someone who can represent them to us in some way, or &#8211; more likely &#8211; we will have heard of them and will be chasing them. <a href="mailto:auntym@mmf.com.au">But] we listen, and consider everything on merit. If you have a particular band in mind please [let me know</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What prompts you to seek out heritage acts like Hawkwind (who were always going to tragically awful) or novelty acts like Airbourne/KISStroyer?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a temptation to ?stunt-cast?, so we apply a few filters to those sorts of ideas. We look at them from various perspectives. Even back 15 years ago, ideas that broke the mould were part of Meredith. Combo La Revelacion played among 15 flannelled, long-haired rock bands. It was actually novel then, so we like to keep breaking the mould, throwing out the formula, as long as it&#8217;s with QUALITY. Hawkwind &#8211; well, we kinda broke a golden rule of ours with that one. It was difficult to find recent live footage, but all the research that we did pointed towards it being good. Sorry about that one.</p>
<p><strong>Can you confirm once and for all that Mot&#8217;rhead were really supposed to be the secret act, and Bob Log was nothing but a patsy?</strong><br/>
A patsy! I love it. No, it was always Bob. That was my idea, sorry. As much as I love Bob &#8211; and he rocked it as hard as anyone could in that situation &#8211; I got it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Any chance of getting Adam Granduciel (from Kurt Vile&#8217;s band) to play a small set of War on Drugs songs off to the side somewhere, like Lou Barlow did a few years back? Same goes for Angel Olsen (from Bonnie Prince Billy&#8217;s band). Are those little off-stage sets something you ask artists if they&#8217;d like to do, or is it something that they suggest?</strong><br/>
We don&#8217;t do those things for Meredith, as it has a strict ?One Music Source? policy. But we are looser with Golden Plains, and we like doing those when and if appropriate. Maybe even in new places on the site each time.</p>
<p><strong>Reigning Sound are due for a run, aren&#8217;t they?</strong><br/>
File under ?nearly happened, but fell apart at last hurdle?.</p>
<p><strong>In 2013, when you get Reigning Sound, can you also program the Sadies? That would be nice.</strong><br/>
Duly noted. Can you likewise note we can&#8217;t promise that we&#8217;ll have Reigning Sound? But we&#8217;ll try again, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been tempted to just program a complete nostalgia line-up &#8211; in genre if not in bands &#8211; and forget about these crazy kids and their new music? I mean, 21 years in &#8211; you must have liked my dad&#8217;s music back in the day, right?</strong><br/>
Yes, I&#8217;ve been tempted, I really have. But ultimately, I&#8217;m a bit lazy.</p>
<p><strong>Who would you most like to see at a Meredith event? What have been you favorite performances at a MMF or GP?</strong><br/>
I look forward to seeing ?small?, new local bands out there most years. As for favourites, <a href="/articles/3539170">The Church at Golden Plains</a> did it for me personally, and Cornelius, Andrew WK come to mind. Dirty Three, of course, Tim Rogers at sunset in about 1999. Powdermonkeys, Hoss, The Mark of Cain going back further. Riot in Belgium late late one recent year. Super Wild Horses. Dexter back in the day, and so on. And, of course, Always on Friday night in 2003.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Back in the early days, there were more local acts, but it&#8217;s been more international-heavy in recent years. Do you have a policy on this? How do you strike a balance?</strong><br/>
No policy, just on merit and whatever we think is best for a particular spot. We don&#8217;t just pick the 30 ?best? bands then try to make that fit the timetable, we choose acts for certain spots from the outset &#8211; sunset, early morning, late night, etc. Its bespoke. I think once or twice we&#8217;ve ended up with a coupla internationals too many so certainly looking to balance that up with more locals. And also getting as many ?smaller? locals into the first announcement is important so they get the attention, rather than dribbling them out later as though they are somehow diminished.</p>
<p><strong>Would you ever get celebs to ?curate? a day, like ATP?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t think so, no. We like to innovate not emulate.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if there might be any scope to add any more esoteric local bands? I would love to see some great Brisbane bands (Kitchen&#8217;s Floor, Feathers, No Anchor, Keep on Dancin&#8217;s) get the chance to play the festival alongside other great acts.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s only a very few precise spots that we can play such acts. Golden Plains has perhaps a little more scope. We have to select carefully and get it just right. Bu,  yeah, I hear you. Will pass this onto the others. Actually, surely they can just read this. </p>
<p><strong>Which bands are you dying to book, but for various reasons have been unable to get?</strong><br/>
If ?various reasons? include ?being dead? then there&#8217;d be a dozen off the top of my head. Sadly we missed a few chances we should have taken. One was that we&#8217;d tried for Big Star a few times and had just started again when Alex Chilton passed away. But apart from those, I haven&#8217;t given up hope on getting anything yet. Who knows how the future will unfold. We never thought we&#8217;d get this far. Maybe KISS will come down in price?</p>
<p><strong>Just to plant some seeds, any chance of some drum&#8217;n?bass like LTJ Bukem or MC Conrad? I reckon they&#8217;re more danceable than some of the minimal stuff that has featured in the past. What about bands that have never toured Australia, like The Coral?</strong><br/>
Have thought about The Coral a few times, not sure why that hasn&#8217;t happened. Yeah, good point generally.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Amenities and improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to adjust the toilets in the smaller campsite loo blocks to a non-giant-friendly height?</strong><br/>
Yes, those loo pedestals are being replaced block by block. Whoops!</p>
<p><strong>Why are there no coat hooks on the back of the dunny doors?</strong><br/>
Who have you been talking to? Well, you will find, that there are hooks this year. Some fancy, some plain.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Have you ever considered a second stage?</strong><br/>
Yes, we have, but we&#8217;ve never seriously gone close to doing it. I think that would kinda wreck something that&#8217;s good about Meredith and Golden Plains. There&#8217;s a ?One Music Source? policy. Plus, where would it go?</p>
<p><strong>Would you ever consider changing the dates of Meredith to November, when all the schoolies kids are still studying? Once I saw a schoolie pee on his mate&#8217;s rug, and then ask heaps of people to drink beer out of his Dunlop Volley. It would be nice to keep them in the exam halls.</strong><br/>
Ha! Really, there are so few under-18s at MMF or GP, hardly any. You have to be with a legal guardian if you are under 18. MMF and GP are not for that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Why no bands on the Monday Morning at GP?</strong><br/>
At this stage, our permit doesn&#8217;t allow live music on Monday. We think about that a lot. Another option down the track might be to open Golden Plains on Friday arvo &#8211; not for a big night, just so that everyone can get in early, set up and cruise for a night.</p>
<p><strong>I love the pure disco direction taken with the announcement of Chic, but I am in a dilemma, as I will have three-week-old twins in tow. Can I leave them with you while I get my boogie on? Or do I just have to suffer in my jocks for being a massive over-breeder?</strong><br/>
My darling, I would love to look after the twins while you bust moves to 90 minutes of Chic. You know Nile plays some of the hits that he wrote/produced in the set, too? Diana Ross, Bowie, Madonna &#8230; It&#8217;s gonna be quite something.</p>
<p><strong>Have you thought about a camping retreat for parents, way up the back somewhere? I&#8217;m older now and I have little tackers. I&#8217;d like to keep them from the noise late at night and to avoid annoying other people with my kids, while still being able to walk down and participate. Also, it would be great to have some babysitters to borrow, so you can go and see the bands you want to!</strong><br/>
A very good question, one we think about all the time. But the thing is that Meredith and Golden Plains aren&#8217;t really for kids. We don&#8217;t put them on for kids, or with kids in mind. Our advice is to leave the kids with the grandparents. Having said that though, we know that kids come, and it&#8217;s free for them to do so, and we give them a wristband with name and contact numbers in case they get lost, etc, but we don&#8217;t do anything beyond that. However, one idea in the workshop is a ?quiet camp?; a small chunk of campground away from everyone else with an almost total noise ban, especially after, say, 8pm.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever considered having a rock&#8217;n?roll DJ in the Pink Flamingo when all the ?doof? music is happening out in the Amphitheatre?</strong><br/>
Yes, we often have, but see comments regarding ?One Music Source?.</p>

<h2>Ticket prices, finances and BYO</h2>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3016700/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="427"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>Why have ticket prices increased over 500% in the last 10 years?</strong><br/>
A fair question. Yes, tickets in 2001 to Meredith were about $50. This year they are $279, which is, I might add, the same price as they were last year. So a few things I would say here. First, basically the ticket price has had to increase to absorb the increased costs. We know the capacity at Meredith shouldn&#8217;t blow out, it needs to be what it is to keep the festival the right, happy size. Secondly, we don&#8217;t allow any commercial sponsorship. Thirdly, its still BYO. So the only way increased costs can be accounted for is in the ticket price. And costs have exploded in the last 10 years or so, any event producer will tell you that.</p>
<p>The festival&#8217;s lineup and facilities and ability to keep run smoothly at all times are galaxies ahead of what they were in 2001. You can&#8217;t run a festival that goes for three days on a farm for $50 any more. Just not possible. Plus, comparisons are odorous I know, but if you compare Meredith and Golden Plains price to other entertainment or sporting events now you&#8217;ll see they are very fairly priced, especially with BYO and a limited capacity and all the excellent permanent facilities of the Supernatural Amphitheatre. We are very very careful to keep the price as affordable as it can be, we really are. We think the price is fair.</p>
<p><strong>Is the alcohol situation (BYO, quite unrestricted) hard to maintain? It&#8217;s a great thing, and pretty much unique to Meredith/Golden Plains.</strong><br/>
Sometimes, to be honest, we do a little sum in our heads of how much more money there would be if it wasn&#8217;t BYO &#8211; and it hurts! But no, it&#8217;s not hard to maintain. Getting rid of BYO is not something we ever want to do. It&#8217;s just better as it is, and quintessentially Meredith.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m fairly sure that the Nolans make a nice tidy amount of money from the festival, but why have punters never had the option of donating money to help Chris Nolan? I want to be able to give back a bit more.</strong><br/>
Thanks. I guess we feel that it would be a bit weird to have that facility at Meredith, and I&#8217;ll take a shot at speaking for Chris when I say that perhaps he doesn&#8217;t want to feel like he needs charity when he&#8217;s at the festival. Also, just by being at the festival you are enriching his life. We used to ask media and industry people who got free tickets to make a nominal donation to Chris. Sometimes people would donate more than the ticket price. Amazing.</p>
<p/>

<p><br/>
<strong>I&#8217;m not sure if this is rude to ask, but I&#8217;ve always wondered about how the festival fares financially. How much do you pay headliners? How much does stuff like insurance cost?</strong><br/>
Haha! You know we get an email once in a while from <a href="/discussions/3468207">people planning to ?start a festival?</a> with questions like this. People who aren&#8217;t in the industry (speaking generally) would be amazed at how much these things cost. The festivals &#8211; most years, touch wood &#8211; make enough so we can keep doing it as full-time jobs. So we can just concentrate on making them the best they can be. Truly. And that they are well-staffed and well-resourced, so if we need, say a new bar or campground or roads or drainage or a crane for a spaceship or a special headliner or whatever we are able to do it. Great fun.</p>
<h2>Regrets</h2>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s been the biggest regret, or biggest ?we really stuffed that up? moment?</strong><br/>
Hawkwind, Golden Plains Number 5 [2010]. Mystery act, Meredith 2005. Meredith ticket fiasco, 2006. It&#8217;s a photo finish.</p>
<p><strong>What <em>really</em> happened with the secret mystery act?</strong><br/>
Nothing. That&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest regret: mystery act Meredith, 2005. Why?</strong><br/>
Well, I think it was a let-down on a big scale, and we unwittingly set Bob Log up for a fall he didn&#8217;t deserve and couldn&#8217;t possibly fight his way out of, though he tried his absolute heart out. History should note, that by the time Bob left the stage, he had won over much of the Amphitheatre, as he would have without being burdened by the ?myystery act? expectations. Why it&#8217;s my biggest regret is that it carried the specific Meredith endorsement, as it were, and we got it wrong. But you know, when it comes to Meredith I have no real regrets, and the ones I have are not big, really.</p>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p><strong>I lost my wallet, phone, girlfriend and dignity at Meredith 2003. Has anyone handed them in to you?</strong><br/>
We have your girlfriend, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the most unusual thing that someone has asked for on the rider? Petting zoo for Roky [Erickson]? Dancing girls? Spare neon-pink socks?</strong><br/>
Riders? Typically pretty boring, really. Often the most desired thing is wireless internet. We have to unplug the fax.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless internet access issues aside, what are your plans to expand the festival&#8217;s presence in the social media space?</strong><br/>
Ah, this is kind of a joke question, right? So, anyway, the answer is mobile coverage is good and improving each year out there. As for social media, well, we don&#8217;t operate a Facebook page for Meredith or Golden Plains. We never had a MySpace one either. So we just do what we do and let others do that stuff. I do <a href="http://twitter.com/auntymeredith">Tweet</a> though, that&#8217;s handy year-round but mainly during the festival.</p>
<p><strong>If you were employed as a woodchuck with full qualifications giving you the ability to chuck wood, how many woods would you be able to chuck in an eight hour working day with a half hour lunch break and fifteen minute morning tea?</strong><br/>
Including naps?</p>
<p><strong>What do you do when the two festivals are not on?</strong><br/>
Watch TV. Sleep. Bingo. Cards with the girls. Bus shopping tours.</p>
<p><strong>Where there other names on the shortlist for Golden Plains? Or if it was a no-brainer, what would you call Golden Plains? little sister, should she ever pop out?</strong><br/>
As a name, Golden Plains came quite late in the piece. That was [Greg] Peelie&#8217;s idea, what with Meredith being the town, and Golden Plains being the shire. At one stage I wanted ?Ramble Tamble? but that didn&#8217;t fly. We would call Golden Plains? little sister ?Henry?.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing as I suggested Urge Overkill, do I get to meet them?</strong><br/>
Hmmm &#8211; maybe.</p>
<p><strong>I wanna be one of those DJs that play between the bands. How do I apply? I don&#8217;t have any referees or references.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a backlog of ideas for those spots, give me a bell in 2016. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get the name Aunty Meredith? Excuse me if I&#8217;m ignorant here. Is it something to do with the ABC?</strong><br/>
My name is Meredith, and I&#8217;m an Aunty.</p>
<p><strong>My brother and I have always wanted to ride our horses to MMF or GP. Can we agist them in the front paddock during the festival?</strong><br/>
Ha! Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of questions will elicit an AJ Maddah-like response, where you get really explicit about the details of a band&#8217;s offer and/or call them pricks?</strong><br/>
Hmmm &#8211; pass.</p>
<p><strong>Are there motels, or hostels nearby that I can hire?</strong><br/>
There are a few, but they&#8217;re not very close. Check out the ?getting there? page of our websites. Or email me.</p>
<p><strong>Aunty Meredith, have you thought of scrapping it all and starting over from scratch? As a podcast?</strong><br/>
Ha! Maybe in my old(er) age. On my darkest, shittiest, world-caving-in-days. I am still not even close to scrapping it all. Best job ever.</p>
<p><strong>Your festival seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?</strong><br/>
Who knows, really? We try really hard. We listen. People that work here have lots of great ideas. We have been lucky. Chris Nolan and Greg Peele had a great idea in 1990 &#8211; and here we all are today. Also, the people that attend are unbelievably fantastic, don&#8217;t you agree? Seriously, they know what to do, how to act, how to react. It&#8217;s a cool thing, we love it, and we are glad others do too.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there no safe sex educators and free condoms on site? Is it because of climate change?</strong><br/>
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>If Occupy Meredith protesters turn up, can we have Barbarion roast them on skewers for an inaugural feast? There&#8217;s not usually a lot of meat on this species, but they would make a hearty meal to go with the corn cobs.</strong><br/>
And strap them to the Meredith Eye and make them go round and round until they recant? Hang on, whose side am I on?</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Do people try to camp at the site at other times of year? How do you deal with this?</strong><br/>
No. Jack shoots them.</p>
<p><strong>I see the Meredith Hotel is for sale. Should I buy it?</strong><br/>
Yes, please. If I had a dollar for every counter meal I&#8217;d eaten there?</p>
<p><strong>When <em>are</em> you going to pen a tell-all memoir?</strong><br/>
Haha! Is this one of those Lisa Simpson questions again? Or is it <em>Almost Famous</em>? There&#8217;s nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Any over-the-top musician tantrum stories that you might wish to share?</strong><br/>
No. The opposite of a tantrum would be when Stan Z our artist services manager found out it was Gary Numan&#8217;s birthday the day he played at Golden Plains. Might have actually been his 50th. His crew were pretty hardcore to deal with so things were a little tense. Stan had got his mum to bake a cake, decorated with Gary-related icing, and he presented it after the show backstage. Gary loved it, he was really moved. So there&#8217;s all these big English guys with piercings and blue-black hair in black leathers eating a nice sponge and giving Stan compliments to pass onto his mum.</p>

<h2>A message from Aunty</h2>
<p>I want to thank everyone for asking so many questions, many of them made me laugh here in the caravan. And thanks to all the people that have been to the festivals and made comments of any kind on the <em>M+N</em> forums. Many improvements and ideas that make the fests better have come from those forums/raves/rants. Thank you!</p>
