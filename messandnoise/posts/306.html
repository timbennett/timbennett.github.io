                <h3>There&#8217;s something cooking in Perth &#8211; and it&#8217;s not just Ghost Hotel&#8217;s stuffed mushrooms or Tame Impala&#8217;s chicken wraps. More than just a collection of recipes from local acts, the &#8216;Love Is My Velocity Cookbook&#8217; has helped document a scene in transit. <strong>MATTHEW HOGAN</strong> talks to its founders Katie Lenanton and Matt Giles about the book&#8217;s past, present and future.

Originally known throughout Perth for their indie club night, various arts exhibitions and 7? split singles featuring the likes of Tucker B&#8217;s, Sugar Army and The Bank Holidays, the Love Is My Velocity collective have unexpectedly found crown and glory with &#8211; a cookbook. Katie Lenanton says she came up with the idea at Perth watering hole the Hyde Park Hotel after a great post-gig conversation with Chris Cobilis of The Tigers about Greek family recipes.</p>
<p>?It was initially a bit of a novelty idea which grew legs as we workshopped it further, deciding upon the unbound, interactive format and art element,? explains Lenanton. ?Ultimately it became a fun, innovative way to document the state&#8217;s emerging artists and musicians.? </p>
<p>Her Love Is My Velocity partner in crime, <em>M+N</em> contributor Matt Giles, admits he wasn&#8217;t 100 percent convinced the idea would work. ?It seemed a bit insubstantial, just having recipes that we say are from bands with some drawings on the back,? he says. ?But as the idea developed I saw that there was space to do a fair bit of analysis and documentation of WA music, and when the art came in I saw that it much better than just simple drawings.</p>
<p>?I think it was the art that pulled everything together, it was a lot better than I expected and opened up a lot more potential for publishing and creative practice in Perth, just because prior to that I didn&#8217;t realise how deep the artistic talent was in Perth. Plus, I think Katie just intuitively knew that the ?The Love Is My Velocity Cookbook? would be a good title.?</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006271/440x314-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
May 2007 saw the release of the first issue, which sold out by the end of the year. Instead of doing a reprint, <em>The Love Is My Velocity Cookbook II</em> was conceived with new bands and artists given the opportunity to whet our appetites. ?If everything goes to plan, the next cookbook will be out in 2011,? Lananton says. ?We aim for each cookbook to act as an almanac of new and prolific bands from the preceding few years, so at this early stage it&#8217;s a bit difficult to choose who might be featured. We are however confident that we can find 52 new bands to work with.?</p>
<p>Giles adds that the cookbook documents a side to Perth&#8217;s music scene that may be absent from triple j playlists and the pages of <em>Rolling Stone</em>. ?Every couple of years a new scene of artists is birthed, but if they don&#8217;t hit the big time a la Eskimo Joe or Birds Of Tokyo then they can vanish without any record of their existence being made. Making the Cookbook a regular thing is one way of doing that [documenting the scene],? he says. </p>
<blockquote><p>?[Tame Impala&#8217;s] idea of a Caesar salad was a cold Red Rooster chicken in a tortilla wrap with lettuce and Caesar dressing &#8211; Those guys are probably sitting on their couches licking peanut butter off a playing card as we speak.?</p></blockquote>
<p>While the book has its fair share of elaborate dishes, there are also some dishes which should carry a health warning. ?Jeff Strong&#8217;s unhealthy breakfast from the first book probably takes the cake,? quips Lenanton. ?It reminded me of going mental at Sizzler when I was younger, a mess of chocolate, sprinkles, ice-cream and toppings mashed together.?</p>
<p>?Well, some bands clearly can&#8217;t cook,? adds Giles. ?In the first Cookbook, the Dee Dee Dums? (who made it into the second as Tame Impala) idea of a Caesar salad was a cold Red Rooster chicken in a tortilla wrap with lettuce and Caesar dressing. If you can&#8217;t cook you&#8217;re inevitably going to eat poorly, so those guys are probably sitting on their couches licking peanut butter off a playing card as we speak.?</p>
<p>However, if you shy away from the foods that may lead to salmonella poisoning, both books have some complex, exotic dishes that can be tackled by both beginner and master chef alike. </p>

?I&#8217;m a bit of retard when it comes to cooking, so I have regularly enjoyed making Capital City&#8217;s veal saltimbocca with lemon spinach and The Painkillers&#8217; tuna balls with garlic yoghurt from the first Cookbook,? says Giles. ?And from the second I have had success with Li&#8217;l Leonie Lionheart&#8217;s vegetable and lentil soup, Ghost Hotel&#8217;s stuffed mushrooms and Hayley Beth&#8217;s Burmese curry puffs. There is a lot to get through though so I tend to move on to new recipes rather than rehash old ones, apart from the veal saltimbocca, which is fucking good.?</p>
<p><em>Love Is My Velocity Cookbook II</em> was launched at May&#8217;s WAMi Festival with a show at Rechabites Hall in Northbridge. Love Is My Velocity also kept busy at WAMi by hosting ?Bank Notes?, which offered local bands such as Abbe May, Extortion and Boys Boys Boys the opportunity to record for free in a Northbridge shop front; the fruits of which were then made available for free downloads. They were overjoyed with the feedback.</p>
<p>?We were really excited by the positive response we received from our WAMi events,? gushes Lenanton. ?The launch night was huge, Channel 10 came down to film Abbe May when she was recording in Bank Notes, and our website stats went through the roof with more than 20gb of free downloads. It was also comforting to hear how much the bands appreciated the free recording time.?</p>
<p>?I looked after the gallery during the exhibition this year and was in the studio for Bank Notes most of the time, so I saw first hand the public&#8217;s reaction, it was really positive,? adds Giles. ?A wide variety of people had a mooch around because of our position in the middle of Northbridge, and the reactions they had to the studio, the exhibition and the book were really fun to watch. Sometimes they were bewildered but also curious. Then you&#8217;d get these kids who looked about 15 dressed in surfy gear, not your usual immaculately dressed art student, marching around really confidently and giving their opinions on everything in a loud voice, then plonking down $250 to buy a large plush bathtub. It was fun to watch.?</p>
