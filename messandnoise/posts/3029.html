                <h3>In an age of disconnect, Lawrence English still believes in the life-affirming power of new sounds. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s kept his label ROOM40 going for 10 years, writes <strong>ANDREW MCMILLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016455/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
If you&#8217;re an experimental sound artist looking to distribute your music internationally, no matter where you&#8217;re based, the name Lawrence English is bound to crop up in your research. English has operated the label ROOM40 out of his home in Brisbane since 2000, or, in his own words, he&#8217;s delivered ?sound parcels from the antipodes since the turn of the century?. Such is the man&#8217;s reputation for courteous professionalism, kindness and amiability among the world&#8217;s non-mainstream music community that he could well front a Tourism Queensland campaign for international relations.</p>
<p>?The six degrees separation thing in this particular field, I think, is much less than six. Even your top level guys, your Brian Enos, the degrees of separation, are like two or three at the most,? English says. ?One of my very good friends, Ben Frost, is Eno&#8217;s <a href="/news/3993475">current mentee</a>. We put out Ben&#8217;s first album. There&#8217;s this great flow-on effect. I think the really good thing about this particular area is it is really like an extended family, in the best way possible, not in the kind of squabbling way.?</p>
<p>English&#8217;s greatest passion appears to be sharing interesting sounds with others. As far as I can gauge, this is why ROOM40 exists. Every release is a labour of love, carefully choreographed with a selection of artists hand-picked from around the globe. ROOM40?s Australian releases over the years include John Chantler, Chris Abrahams (of The Necks) and Rod Cooper.</p>
<p>?I&#8217;m a big believer in that generally in music, there&#8217;s enough room for everyone to do their thing and to find an audience. The kind of competitive, closed spaces that sometimes happen with more contemporary music &#8211; I just don&#8217;t believe in that because I think there&#8217;s plenty of room for Big Day Out, for Soundwave, for all these major festivals. I believe in open systems. The cycle of the fringes to the centre and back around again; that&#8217;s what keeps it interesting.?</p>
<p>As 2010 marks ROOM40?s 10th anniversary, I dropped into English&#8217;s home in Kelvin Grove, a suburb of Brisbane, to discuss its past, present and future.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve read that you consider ROOM40 not just as a label, but a multi-arts organisation, which encompasses the label, distribution, promoting shows &#8211; what else?</strong><br/>
Festivals, art curation, and art installation. It started as an umbrella so it was like the label publishing editions and all that kind of stuff; the opportunity to bring people to Australia and send Australia overseas, like a kind of cycle thing &#8211; We&#8217;ve had some great international artists. Christian Marclay was here a few years ago in Melbourne at ACMI [Australian Centre for the Moving Image]. But we are yet to see that celebration of contemporary sound culture or a kind of connective thing &#8211; this thing is, for most Australian musicians in this area, their profile is overseas. Someone like Oren Ambarchi, for example, that guy&#8217;s touring in every other country. He plays in Australia maybe three times a year or something. He might play 50 shows. The same for me: I played two shows this year and by the end of the year I&#8217;ll have played like 30 or 40 something. Ninety percent of them will not be in Australia. It&#8217;s just because the opportunities are elsewhere and Australia is just one of a number of countries that you can go to. </p>
<p>I really respect people that can do the, ?We&#8217;re just gonna tour in Australia every two months?, but it doesn&#8217;t work for this kind of thing. It&#8217;s a different kind of engagement with the audience maybe, and also it&#8217;s a different kind of &#8211; there&#8217;s not so much of a need for marketing, almost. It&#8217;s experiential more than media-oriented, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>By now, ROOM40 has built a reputation for being associated with quality. It has a following; people believe in the label, and they trust your judgment.</strong><br/>
Yes, it&#8217;s like a curation thing, which is great. That&#8217;s what I love doing &#8211; There&#8217;s a lot of stuff that I hear that is fantastic but doesn&#8217;t necessarily fit with ROOM40. That&#8217;s where something like someone good came into it, the other label, because it was really a mechanism to kind of release some of that stuff that was clearly not left-leaning enough to be part of ROOM40 but stuff I still believed in. </p>
<p>Akira Kosemura, for example, this really young Japanese guy, sent us his first record. [Lawrence&#8217;s wife] Bec was listening to it and said, ?This is really great.? I thought, &#8220;Is it?&#8221; Then I listened to it and I thought, ?This <em>is</em> really great!? &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t a fit for ROOM40. We started the Someone Good label basically around this record and there were a few other things that had been sent in?</p>
<p>My vision for ROOM40 is not about ?the new record?. It&#8217;s always like, ?This is a record about a particular concept theme, idea, process, whatever&#8230;? In 10 years time, you can go back to that record &#8211; like you listen to the first Ben Frost record, he&#8217;s a good example. You can hear his quality of composition in it, but it&#8217;s his exploration of guitar and volume, and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s as meaningful outside of his catalogue as it is as part of it, and that&#8217;s a really big thing for me; trying to find projects from artists that aren&#8217;t just part of their catalogue. It&#8217;s a very focused principle. With ROOM40, we try and find that material that allows for that decent engagement over time. I think for me, there&#8217;s no record we&#8217;ve released that I don&#8217;t have that relationship with, which I&#8217;m really happy about. </p>

<h2>?Totally illegal, but totally amazing?</h2>
<p><strong>Do you consider ROOM40 an Australian label?</strong><br/>
Not really, no. I don&#8217;t think about it as an Australian label necessarily. I think about it in terms of: we publish music. Australia is probably represented quite high in comparison to other countries, like in comparison to France or Spain &#8211; we&#8217;ve got quite a few English musicians, quite a few Japanese, quite a few Americans. Australia would rate equally to those other countries, and in fact some of our most successful records have been the Australian ones, and successful in terms of getting exposure internationally. Like the new Chris Abrahams [The Necks] record <em>Play Scar</em>, which is just going great guns. The response to that in the UK and the States has been really amazing, and Canada? </p>
<p>I guess sometimes there&#8217;s an expectation that because you&#8217;re based somewhere that you will publish the majority of that work. I think that works really well for certain kinds of labels. If you look at [Brisbane label] Plus One, I think they developed a really great roster of bands that they&#8217;re in touch with and working with directly. But I don&#8217;t think I could be afforded that possibility because if I did that it would be a very limited roster. I don&#8217;t know how it would be sustainable, necessarily, to do that.</p>
<p>I think there are really great musicians all across Australia and I have an opportunity to work with a good number of those in this field anyway. There are some people here that I absolutely believe in so strongly and want to see do well, someone like Robin Fox, for example. I just have the most incredible respect for as a musician, as a visual artist, as a thinker. He&#8217;s someone that I would do whatever I could do to get his work exposed. I&#8217;ll do it. That&#8217;s very much a big part of it for me?</p>
<p>We did Robin Fox&#8217;s laser show in an alleyway in the city [Brisbane] this year. We had like 300 something people turn up. It was amazing to watch peoples&#8217; faces, like this incredible abstract laser sound show &#8211; People were genuinely like, &#8220;Fuck, why haven&#8217;t I seen this before?&#8221; That is what I love about this kind of thing; you still have this opportunity with this music &#8211; even though it&#8217;s much more recognised than it was 15 years ago &#8211; people can still have a kind of transformative experience from it. That&#8217;s fantastic because that&#8217;s really what I want to do for people with the physicality of the sounds, like actually let people experience this thing.</p>
<p>There are certain kinds of paradigms that are really predominant in popular music, music as entertainment, which I think is a really important function. But there&#8217;s something that goes deeper sometimes, I reckon, where you start to kind of play the effective sound, I guess the duality of sound in the body, like the low-frequency sound and then sound in the cerebral context, which is higher frequency in terms of listening with the ears. I think there&#8217;s a really great &#8211; not dichotomy, but orbiting relationship between these two things. When you can bring them together and people are feeling sound with their body or hearing sound with their body and then contemplating it with their mind, I think that can be entirely transformative. People don&#8217;t always get to do that.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re watching a band, you get that physicality of it but your brain is kind of &#8211; if it&#8217;s a band with words, you&#8217;re either thinking about the textual stuff or you&#8217;re singing along and just enjoying yourself. That is absolutely great, but I think sometimes it&#8217;s important to have those relationships that somehow go deeper and make you realise you&#8217;re kind of a system. The reason that you feel some things when you&#8217;re listening to music is not just the emotional content of the lyric or the tonality of the guitar, but the physicality of the sound, the fact that the bass somehow affects your body, the fact that some high frequency sound excites your ears in a way that you didn&#8217;t know they could be excited. </p>

<strong>I&#8217;m interested to know when you discovered these things. When did you discover that you were interested in pursuing that kind of feeling, rather than just watching a band and what they were performing?</strong><br/>
I got interested in sound when I was super young &#8211; It&#8217;s a funny story really, but I used to go bird watching with my dad. There&#8217;s this one particular bird which lives at the end of our street. It&#8217;s an incredible bird. It&#8217;s called a Reed Warbler, and it basically sounds like an oscillator, like someone playing a synthesiser. When I was a little kid we&#8217;d go to this place which is not going to be apartments soon, along the Brisbane River, back then it was kind of swamp and forest and stuff. You could stand there and there&#8217;d be these reeds and swamps and you could hear the birds but you couldn&#8217;t see them. My dad said, &#8220;You have to listen to the bird, get a rough idea and then try and use your eyes? &#8211; That was really my first experience of sound in space and how the two kind of function together.</p>
<p>From then, I guess I started to think more about &#8211; the idea of how you locate yourself in space through sound, and what your ears actually do for you. I got interested in electronic [music]. Originally I was into a whole bunch of different stuff &#8211; from sort of metal and all that of thing, through to hip-hop (I still think Public Enemy&#8217;s <em>Fear Of A Black Planet</em> is one of the great records of all time) and then some pop music. Then I got into some industrial stuff. I think it was that period, where the kind of electronic-industrial, starting thinking about sounds more than about melodies or that kind of thing, and what role they played. It&#8217;s partly because you look at bands like Einst&#8217;rzende Neubauten and that kind of thing, how the physicality of performance and the physicality of the sound is clearly as important as the music that surrounds it. </p>
<p>It kind of grew very organically out of that thing, where you start thinking clearly certain kinds of frequencies are going to activate the body in certain kinds of ways. I think this area of work and certainly in the last 15 years, because of technology and the refinement of the sound system as a mechanism, we can control that stuff really precisely now, more and more. There are these new systems that basically give you the sensation of being in a space like this, and it&#8217;s from a sound system. These ambi-sonic things are absolutely incredible.<br/>
It was a very organic pathway into that kind of thing, and partly &#8211; it&#8217;s not always just about that. Sometimes it is about the exchange between people. We&#8217;ve done a lot of improvised concerts and that kind of thing, and that&#8217;s another component of this relationship, how people listen and respond and build things organically themselves.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016458/400x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It&#8217;s not kind of standing and watching a performance and enjoying yourself and having a great time, which is all good. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re enjoying yourself in a way that&#8217;s sort of like you&#8217;ve eaten a hamburger and it&#8217;s great and delicious and feels good. At the end of it you think, &#8220;That was great&#8221;, but then you have something like a really nice Japanese meal and it&#8217;s got different textures &#8211; but it&#8217;s equally sort of satisfying. It stimulates things that the burger doesn&#8217;t, in the same way the burger stimulates things that the Japanese meal doesn&#8217;t. I like to work somewhere between those.</p>
<p>I love performing in galleries but I also love playing on really fucking loud sound systems. These shows I did in Russia last year with Ben Frost, they were illegally loud, illegally, illegally, illegally loud. I have a sound check sound that&#8217;s for low frequency bass. I played some of that, and I literally watched the whole building in St Petersburg go [<em>makes a shuddering sound</em>]. I&#8217;ve never seen it happen before. Bits of stuff were falling out of the ceilings. It was &#8211; totally, totally illegal but totally, totally amazing.</p>
<h2>?In math class with a fanzine?</h2>
<p><strong>Your background is in music journalism. You&#8217;re also a sound performer. How long have you been performing for?</strong><br/>
16 years.</p>
<p><strong>So six years before the label started?</strong><br/>
Actually, I had another label before ROOM40 &#8211; I started it just before I left high school as an idea. The first release we did was actually on cassette, before cassettes went out of fashion. At the time, making a CD was really hard and expensive. That&#8217;s what people forget. In the early &#8217;90s it was expensive to make CDs. You had to get a graphic designer because no one had design programs. It was a whole lot of that kettle of fish.</p>
<p><strong>What was the label called?</strong><br/>
Horror Show. I notice there&#8217;s an Australian act called Horrorshow, which is?</p>
<p><strong>? a Sydney hip hop duo.</strong><br/>
Yeah, so I&#8217;ve always wondered about that. We released the first 2 Dogs record and a bunch of Resin Dogs remixes and that kind of thing, but we also did a lot of punk rock stuff and industrial music, some metal. <em>Spoken Word</em>, a record with the author Nick Earls, which we did at Livid [the Brisbane music festival] one year.</p>
<p><strong>So you weren&#8217;t specialising.</strong><br/>
No. Although, it was entirely focused on Australia. We had an Australian distributor and we distributed almost exclusively in Australia. There were a few records we sent overseas but the focus was definitely here. It was a different time. There were a lot of stores. The work was very much focused on Australian artists working locally, not internationally, which is the big difference when you talk about that and ROOM40. It&#8217;s Australian artists working internationally.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I hear stuff at least once a month that makes me think, &#8216;Wow, thank God I&#8217;m alive now. That&#8217;s incredible.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was quite a very different place to be working, making music, and selling music, and that kind of thing &#8211; It got to a point where, sometime in ?98 or ?99, the distributor that we had, I went down one day on a Thursday and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m here for my cheque.&#8221; They were like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s been posted off today, it will be here on Monday? &#8211; I came back Monday and [they said], &#8220;We went bankrupt.&#8221; Great, thanks a lot. That was a kind of fairly large amount of money that was owed, and that point a particularly large amount of money, because I was 20 or something and I&#8217;d invested a fair bit in the label. </p>
<p><strong>Wait &#8211; you started it in high school?</strong><br/>
Yeah, in math class with a fanzine &#8211; The fanzine started first and the label kind of came on the back of that. I must have been a little bit older &#8211; 21 or 22 &#8211; and I thought, ?OK, this is a really good chance to start fresh, refocus everything.? At that point as well, I&#8217;d always been doing stuff internationally because of the fanzine. We traded with a lot of bands overseas.</p>
<p><strong>What was this fanzine called?</strong><br/>
<em>Babylon</em>, not attached to the famous Brisbane venue from the same period, but a nice coexistence. After that, there was this shift towards ROOM40. It was a really quick shift, but it was clear, because at that point I&#8217;d been given a few records by people that weren&#8217;t going to fit with what was happening with the other label &#8211; That was a big push to start the label, particularly, that I knew three or four artists that I really believed in that couldn&#8217;t get their music out. I thought &#8220;This is totally crazy. How can this not be coming out?&#8221; Then basically that was one of the big things that kicked it off, this kind of desire to make people hear this music.</p>
<p>One of the records I&#8217;m thinking of was the DJ Olive Sleep record. He gave me that record when he was out here, after the label had started, and it was one of those things that really resolved me. I thought, &#8220;People have to hear this album! It&#8217;s just so beautiful, so interesting&#8221;, and we did do it. We put it out. [It&#8217;s] just like an ambient record but it&#8217;s a kind of elegant exploration of that idea of the place between consciousness and unconsciousness that sound can exist in.</p>
<p><strong>Before you told me all that, I was going to ask: when did you decide to stop being an outsider in the industry? When did you start wanting to distribute peoples&#8217; music?</strong><br/>
It was pretty much in tandem, at the same time. I wanted people to find out about the music. A lot of the times the stuff that I was working with then were small bands in other countries that had no following anywhere &#8211; I wanted people to be as excited about them as I was, and that&#8217;s very much a big part of it still. I honestly think people are looking for new experiences in music and in film and &#8211; in culture. I want to try in some ways instigate those new experiences?</p>
<p>Fanzine tapped into this community of people across the world that were doing this stuff. Whereas, when I did writing for [Brisbane streetpress] <em>Time Off</em> or [other] magazines, I was still reviewing stuff on the fringes, but it was more kind of things that people go to a record store and get. Back then it wasn&#8217;t like you could go online and find someone&#8217;s album, PayPal it and it&#8217;s here in two days. That was the thing that was real interesting. The first few years of the fanzine, I&#8217;d often hear about a band and it would take me two years to get the demo tape, two years because I did tape trading with people &#8211; I love that sound of the degeneration of the music in the copy.</p>

<strong>I was intrigued at UnConvention Brisbane earlier this year when you spoke about this concept of ?The Funnel.? I wonder if you could apply that to what you&#8217;ve done with ROOM40. It seems to me that you started small and you&#8217;ve since done more and more things. Could you explain this concept?</strong><br/>
When I use the funnel, I use it like a metaphor for your life, in a way. When I first started, the beginning of the funnel is really wide and there&#8217;s lots of things that you can fit into the funnel. I was doing band management, running the label, doing a fanzine, freelance writing, doing some design, running club nights, all this stuff. Gradually, as you start entering the funnel and there are more and more opportunities in each of those areas, it becomes clear that some of them aren&#8217;t going to be able to be sustained, or some of them sustain your interest more than others, so gradually I shrunk down. For example, I didn&#8217;t really do club nights, or I stopped doing band management. Then gradually as you move through the funnel things become more focused.</p>
<p>I guess for me, ROOM40 was the beginning of the focus. Before that there&#8217;d been a lot of other stuff and it wasn&#8217;t quite as shaped and clear as it was when ROOM40 kind of took shape. ROOM40 streamlined all the ideas I had up to that point, so I think that&#8217;s the beginning of the funnel for me.</p>
<p><strong>Is running ROOM40 your full-time job?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve never had a job, actually &#8211; It&#8217;s not the usual path and it sometimes has been very, very, very difficult to maintain. I often wonder why. I think there are obviously some pros and cons to doing that, but I think if I was to take on a full-time job, it would suddenly mean I can&#8217;t provide &#8211; look, 90% of my working life is working for other people, delivering their music, delivering their concerts, delivering various kinds of things. The time for Lawrence English in that is very small and I think that&#8217;s something that every producer cum label person that&#8217;s also an artist has to deal with. There is this divide that happens and generally you divide yourself out to other peoples&#8217; work.</p>
<p><strong>But you knew that. You&#8217;re okay with that.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t think I knew it necessarily as much. Even down to things like I&#8217;ve got to finish a piece for this magazine in the States. I was meant to finish it yesterday but I had to put on some shows yesterday and I was doing a lot of work on Frankly! [It&#8217;s A Pop Music Festival], because it&#8217;s in a few weeks time. That was prioritised so my work falls down &#8211; It&#8217;s a juggling thing but I love supporting other people. Look, ROOM40 states it&#8217;s a ?friends and family? label &#8211; I think all of our [artists] sign up personally &#8211; either through very long communications via email and Skype, or personally if we met at shows, or they&#8217;re a friend of a friend. That&#8217;s how a lot of the music comes into the fold. We have signed a few things from demos over the years, but really it&#8217;s about, &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta listen to blah&#8230;&#8221;, and I listen to it and I think, &#8220;Oh my God, this is incredible!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>?I just believe you can spend your entire life being as stimulated by music as you can by great books, and great films.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s fascinating that it still happens, that you can still be excited by new pieces of music, even though you&#8217;ve heard so much stuff throughout your life.</strong><br/>
Totally. That&#8217;s the beauty of art, generally &#8211; The best thing is I think I&#8217;m very fortunate to have the chance to be exposed to those things pretty regularly. I hear stuff at least once a month that makes me think, &#8220;Wow, thank God I&#8217;m alive now. That&#8217;s incredible.? ROOM40 in some ways is just about sharing that thing, and hopefully building a group that will want to have that happening as regularly as they can. </p>
<p>For me, one of the big things I&#8217;m really conscious of is that our engagement as people, our engagement with music, statistically, if there&#8217;s five of us sitting here, of that five, four will stop listening when they&#8217;re about 26-27. The music they&#8217;ll listen to from then on will be the period of when they first discovered things (18-27). That&#8217;s how golden radio comes into existence.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something that happens there, a disconnect at some point &#8211; whether it&#8217;s an issue of access or interest, or whatever it is &#8211; [when] their listening stops. I think that&#8217;s a shame. It&#8217;s a real shame. It&#8217;s like you read until you&#8217;re 27 and then you&#8217;re never going to read another new book. Why? There are great books you want to return to, of course, but surely there are other things that have been created that will somehow engage you.</p>
<p>Partly, it&#8217;s to do with the memories and feelings that particular music brings to you. I can listen to music that I would probably never be able to engage with now, but I can enjoy it because I remember when I was 13 and listening to KISS. I still love KISS because I engaged with it then. If I found it now, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be a big KISS fan, but it&#8217;s an important part of what made me who I am, so I connect to it.<br/>
I think this is a real question: Why is it that we disconnect, or why is it the majority of people disconnect? That&#8217;s partly a big contribution as to why record stores are disappearing faster than book stores, for example. Partly it&#8217;s a question of technology with books, but bookstores I think we&#8217;re going to see for a lot longer yet. Record stores, I think we&#8217;re going to see a lot less very soon. I think that&#8217;s an interesting value hierarchy thing that happens or whether it&#8217;s just the kind of cultural sanctioning that happens with music. It&#8217;s partly to do with the kind of youthification of the music industry, which has been happening since the ?50s, obviously, since singles.</p>
<p>I just believe you can spend your entire life being as stimulated by music as you can by great books, and great films. I don&#8217;t think that necessarily happens as much as it should. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to think that through these concerts or through this listening stuff that happens, people at least are conscious of what their ears do, and the effect the ears can have on the brain, the heart and the body. </p>
