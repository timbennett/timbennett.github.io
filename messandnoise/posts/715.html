                <h3>Songs about greyhounds, ponds, love, death and sewerage plants &#8211; <strong>MARITA DYSON</strong> leads us through The Orbweavers? new album &#8216;Loom&#8217;, which was recorded in Melbourne over winter.
</h3>
<h2>?Merri?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024624/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The Merri Creek runs north-south through Melbourne, joining the Yarra River in Abbotsford. A section of the creek runs through parkland at the end of our street where we walk with our dog. Areas along the creek used to be home to clay pits for brick making, and Melbourne&#8217;s deepest bluestone quarry, founded around 1860. When the quarry reached the end of its life, the site was taken over by Whelan the Wrecker in the 1960s, who proceeded to fill the vast hole with demolished building rubble. When the hole was filled, it became a park, with a winding bike path along the bank. You can still see remnant bricks from demolished buildings poking out of the stratified cutting along the bike path. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic to think the materials used to construct these demolished buildings ended up buried in the place they were excavated from. I learned a lot about the history of Whelan the Wrecker in a book by Robyn Annear called <em>A City Lost and Found</em>. We wanted this song to sound like the creek valley &#8211; watery, reverberant and whispery like the allocasuarinas lining the bank. The bell birds in the song were recorded on my phone next to the creek. In some ways, this could be a love song for the creek. I don&#8217;t like writing love songs about people.</p>

<h2>?Double Thread?</h2>
<p>We tried to make this song sound like a humming sewing machine. Stuart&#8217;s guitar line at the start reminds me of a treadle sewing machine needle, whirring along. I tried to make the harmonies warbly, like the Andrews Sisters, while thinking about women working in textiles factories in Brunswick in the ?30s and ?40s. At first, I was worried we had recorded this song too fast, which is why it is followed by a slower song in the track listing, to break the pace. This is the only song where we used double tracked vocals, which seemed to suit the ?double? theme. It&#8217;s about being over-cautious, and using double thread instead of single thread for extra strength.</p>

<h2>?Horseshoe Lake?</h2>
<p>This song was written in the summer of 2009. It feels like an old song that has been hiding out for a while. It&#8217;s about hazardous substances, toxins, feeling polluted and making the journey to a place called ?Horseshoe Lake? in the hope of changing fortunes. There are a number of ?Horseshoe Lakes? in the world. This particular horseshoe lake was created when a meteorite collided with earth, creating a U-shaped furrow. </p>
<p>The string parts at the end of the song were added in a fit of experimental mania one Saturday night. I had always wanted extra instrumentation in this part of the song, but was not sure what to add. We tried one violin line, which was not enough, so we just kept adding more and more string lines. It got to 3am, and Stuart [Flanagan] said the computer was freaking out about all the tracks. So I had to stop.</p>

<h2>?Confessions?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to own up to things, to admit that you haven&#8217;t been honest. You hope the other person will say something. You don&#8217;t want to be cast out alone forever, feeling like rubbish. The trumpet and violin lines are written to pair with the boy/girl parts. We built a cubby house of mattresses to record the vocals in, as ambient car noises kept getting in the recording.</p>

<h2>?You Can Run (Fern&#8217;s Theme)?</h2>
<p>We live with a retired racing greyhound called Fern. She was trained to run in races from birth, and for this reason we are never allowed to let her off the lead in a public place. She could potentially run off at 60km per hour, and we would never catch her. Due to her training she also does not understand about traffic or roads.</p>
<p>?You Can Run? is about how Fern has to stay on the lead. Other dogs run up to her at the park, and try to get her to run with them, but she is not allowed to, and that makes me sad. Fern seems good natured about it. She does horse-like jumps of excitement on the lead when other dogs approach, as if to say, ?Hi &#8211; I can&#8217;t show you my amazing running skills, but I will do this fancy jump instead.? She does this silently, and is very quiet in general. We have only heard her bark once.</p>
<p>This song is about living with duties, restrictions, responsibilities. Stuart wrote the guitar solo based on the way Fern does short running bursts in our backyard. I think it captures her playful moves and personality well.</p>

<h2>?Japanese Mountains?</h2>
<p>This song is about wanting to escape the city. It is about trying to deal with general worry, nightmares and stress. The Japanese phrase at the end of the song translates as ?please do not worry?. The arrangement features a Japanese koto (a traditional zither/harp) we found at a second-hand shop. The koto didn&#8217;t come with any bridges, so we couldn&#8217;t play it at first. We had to wait years before we found bridges. For the recording we just made up a tuning for it, as the bridges are moveable. Kotos are made from Paulownia tree wood, which is lightweight, fine grained and has high water resistance. The wood is also used to construct chests for storing kimonos &#8211; providing protection from humidity and mildew, and I read recently that it is used to make surfboards in Australia. Paulownia features in this song, along with other favourite trees &#8211; maple and cedar.</p>

<h2>?The Other Side?</h2>
<p>This is about ponds and death. It was written just after a family friend, who was a gardener, died. Her garden was filled with terracotta pots turned into ponds full of goldfish, Japanese bamboo and banana palms. I was thinking about the role of insects and plants in breaking down organic matter and bodies; the transferral of chemical elements from one living entity to another. The recording features a dark ride cymbal shimmering through the whole track. This was the last thing we added to the recording while we were mixing it.</p>

<h2>?Spotswood?</h2>
<p>This song is a tribute to the historic Spotswood Sewerage Pumping Station, which pumped Melbourne&#8217;s waste water out of the city, and uphill to the Werribee treatment flats, between 1897-1960, by means of huge steam powered engines. To this day, Melbourne&#8217;s sewerage still flows through the same pipes and wells beneath the historic building, but the pumping has been taken over by a modern facility in nearby Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Melbourne&#8217;s houses and buildings are connected to the Pumping Station through a networks of underground pipes and drains, flowing right under the Westgate Bridge, beneath the river bed. Without a sewerage system the city would be awash in foul and noxious effluent, as it was in the late 1800s, earning the boom-time moniker ?Smellbourne?.</p>
<p>This song is also about returning to a place you did not expect to.</p>

<h2>?One By One?</h2>
<p>This song is based on a story a close friend wrote about a partnership breaking up. You carry on after the breakup, and don&#8217;t see the person for a long time. Then they come back, and expect the relationship to resume without strain because so much time has passed. Sometimes that cannot happen. We wanted the trumpet to sound nostalgic.</p>

<h2>?Loom?</h2>
<p>We started recording this song in early 2010. We were thinking about abandoned knitting mills and textile factories in our area, the women who worked at them, imagining the hardships of factory life over the last 100 years, and the cavernous spaces, now empty and full of insects.</p>
<p>This recording started with a sequence of piano chords. Stuart had removed the front panels of the piano to get the microphones in position, and we were struck by how the internal workings reminded us of a loom: vertical piano strings like warp threads, a horizontal row of felted hammers like yarn feeders, the creaking shift of the soft and sustain pedals like rhythmic machine movement. Stuart ended up using the creaks and knocking sounds of the pedals as the percussive rhythm track of the song.</p>
<p>While recording, we were also thinking about the relationships between insects, textiles and spaces &#8211; particularly moths. Silk moths cocoons are plunged into boiling water (tragically &#8211; with the moth still alive inside) to make silk thread for weaving. Moths eat clothes in forgotten wardrobes. Moths are often found tapping futilely against closed windows, or trapped in light fittings &#8211; on doomed flights of off-course celestial navigation. Stuart made a synthesised algorithm replicating the sound of moth wings and added it over the top. We wanted to convey the anxious feeling of trapped insects. Repetition. Progression and stasis. Trapped at a desk yearning to be free.</p>
<p>This song has a lot of tracks. Our computer did not like this song because of all the tracks. It crashed whenever we tried to play the audio files.</p>

<h2>?Rise Above?</h2>
<p>Alarms, bells, sirens, beacons. A lot of ice is melting, it has to go somewhere. We wanted the bell tolls and long cello bows to sound like ships departing the docks in fog and mist, with vocals sighing out like a farewell call. The bell bird outro makes me feel like I have been up all night, walking home at dawn. It is a bookend to the bell birds of Merri. The journey of water from inland creek, to river and out to sea.</p>
