It&#8217;s been a long and successful journey for the Hoodoo Gurus.  Originally known as Le Hoodoo Gurus, the band was conceived as a three-guitar, no-bass outfit with a predilection for rockabilly, glam and bubblegum surf. In the chest-beating pub rock scene of the time &#8211; augmented by the legacy of the Radio Birdman era &#8211; Le Hoodoo Gurus stood out for their colour, flair and humour. </p>
<p>Lead vocalist and guitarist Dave ?Flick? Faulkner and drummer James Baker had played together previously in Perth in legendary punk band The Victims. Original guitarist Rod Radalj was part of the same Perth punk scene, having spent a short stint in The Scientists, before leaving to pursue other interests and eventually moving to Sydney. In the early days of 1981, Faulkner, Baker, Radalj and third guitarist Kimball Rendall (at that time a member of XL Capris) joined together in the first line-up of Le Hoodoo Gurus. Rendall left shortly after the release of the Gurus? debut single ?Leilani?, deciding to concentrate on his fledgling career in film production (in a Zen-like scenario, Rendall would go onto produce a number of the Gurus? film clips).</p>
<p>After Clyde Bramley joined on bass, Radalj decided to leave. Stuck for a second guitarist, Faulkner settled on Brad Shepherd, formerly of Brisbane band The 31st and at the time playing Mick Taylor to Chris Masuak&#8217;s Keith Richards in The Hitmen. Baker would be replaced eventually by former Hitmen drummer Mark Kingsmill, while Bramley&#8217;s bass duties were taken over in 1988 by former Divinyls bassist Rick Grossman.</p>
<p>On the back of such classic tracks as ?Leilani?, ?I Want You Back?, ?Bittersweet?, ?My Girl?, ?Miss Free Love ?69? and the perennial party favourite ?Like Wow, Wipeout?, the Hoodoo Gurus evolved to become one of Australia&#8217;s most successful rock&#8217;n?roll bands of the modern era, as well as forging a strong reputation in the American college radio scene.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine years after the band&#8217;s conception &#8211; which includes a six- year hiatus from 1997-2003 (during which time Faulkner and Shepherd would pursue their ?60s garage interests in The Persian Rugs) &#8211; they&#8217;re back with their ninth studio album, <em>Purity of Essence</em>. With its catchy licks and Faulkner&#8217;s trademark sardonic humour, it confirms there&#8217;s life in the Gurus yet.</p>

<strong>Can you tell me about how the Hoodoo Gurus got together originally?</strong><br/>
Dave Faulkner: It&#8217;s a pretty famous story. I&#8217;d moved to Sydney a few months earlier from Perth. Rod Radalj, who was also from Perth, was living in Sydney at the time. And then there was Kimball Rendall who was going out with a girl I knew from Perth, so it was the Perth mafia I think. Kimball was in a band called The XL Capris. It was a New Year&#8217;s Eve party at the end of 1980, so it was the first day of 1981. It was so hot in this terrace house in Darlinghurst that we climbed out of the kitchen to get some fresh air.</p>
<p>We just started talking music, saying, ?Why isn&#8217;t anyone playing those types of songs? &#8211; talking about rockabilly and that sort of thing. So we decided to form a band right there and then. Nine months later and we had our first gig &#8211; which Brad attended. He came to the gig and saw our debut.</p>
<p>Brad Shepherd: Instantly, what I loved about the band was that they embraced &#8211; even though they were original tunes &#8211; ?50s rock&#8217;n?roll and glam rock, like Suzi Quattro and T-Rex and that kind of thing. Stuff that was probably in the environment of Sydney in 1981 viewed as pretty uncool. The shadow of Radio Birdman loomed pretty large in Sydney and these guys were saying, ?Not only do we love this music that is uncool, but we welcome it into our lives.? And I loved that stuff as well.</p>
<p><strong>Prior to joining the Gurus, Brad was playing guitar in The Hitmen. Dave, I understand you weren&#8217;t much of a fan of The Hitmen?</strong><br/>
DF: I&#8217;d seen Brad performing and hadn&#8217;t paid much attention because he was the extra guy in the band. Chris Masuak was the main guitarist in the band and took all the solos! And Brad was just &#8230;</p>
<p>BS: I was the second banana!</p>
<p>DF: [<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah, the second banana.  I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of The Hitmen&#8217;s music. I don&#8217;t think anyone would be surprised to hear that.  It wasn&#8217;t until I saw Brad performing with Clyde Bramley, who&#8217;d joined us on bass when we finally got a bass guitar. They had this side project called Super K, which was all bubblegum music. I loved that music &#8211; that was even more uncool music!</p>
<p>BS: And very much in tune with what the Hoodoo Gurus were doing. It was uncool music &#8211; we were happy to stand on a podium and shout it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We didn&#8217;t shy away from being Australian, but a lot of our influences were American, both musically and culturally. We&#8217;d talk about sitcoms in a lot of interviews.?</p></blockquote>
<p>DF: I saw one of their gigs. It wasn&#8217;t just the music that were playing, but the way they played it. They were true to it. And Brad showed his depth as a guitarist &#8211; it was a whole new dimension to what I&#8217;d seen before &#8211; and he was also a great singer, which I&#8217;d never seen him do. </p>
<p>So what happened then was that Clyde had joined the band on bass. Rod was rehearsing with us and enjoying it, but after a couple of months, for some strange reason, he decided we were going to lose our hipness by having a bass guitar and no longer having the three guitars, and he quit, without any provocation <a href="/icons/3555244">read Radalj&#8217;s version of the story [here</a>]. So suddenly we had to find another guitarist, and I thought of Brad straight away. It was a bit of a political minefield but he jumped ship, and caused a lot of grief at the other end ?cause The Hitmen had a new album coming out. But we&#8217;re glad he did because The Hoodoo Gurus, to be honest, properly gelled at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Dave, did your songwriting change when you went from the three-guitar line-up to the conventional two-guitar, bass and drums line-up?</strong><br/>
DF: Probably a bit, yes. I wrote the song ?She? right when we got the bass. I was also getting a bit tired of being colourful and crazy. I wanted to get a bit more real. It took a whole another album before that happened. We did <em>Stoneage Romeos</em>, which had a lot of material that was Le Hoodoo Gurus. ?I Want You Back? was one of the last songs to be included on the album, and I&#8217;d written it just before the album was recorded. We discovered our power, I suppose, when we got a bass.  We&#8217;d always been struggling to have a focus, and we gelled &#8211; the songwriting became a bit more positive as well.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve got a strong college radio following in the States.  Did you have that before you went over there to play?</strong><br/>
DF: The first album was snapped up &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how that happened.  A&amp;M Records heard it and bought it and they released and it found favour immediately on college. I don&#8217;t know if people had had it on import &#8211; I really don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>BS: It seemed to have a very rapid groundswell.</p>
<p><strong>Did your American audiences know you were Australian?</strong><br/>
DF: No, they didn&#8217;t always. We certainly make a lot of it. At the same time there was Men At Work, and they were huge. It was all about Vegemite and people were very conscious of their Australian-ness. We really didn&#8217;t relate to that. We didn&#8217;t shy away from being Australian, but a lot of our influences were American, both musically and culturally. We&#8217;d talk about sitcoms in a lot of interviews.</p>
<p>BS: I do remember thinking at the time that a lot of folks from the east coast thought we were from the west coast, and a lot of folks from the west coast thought we were from the UK. But generally there a lot of folks in the US who didn&#8217;t even know where Australia was &#8211; they were impressed that we spoke English so well. Things have a changed a lot since then!</p>
<p>DF: Rick [Grossman, bass] joined the band in 1988, and he remembers doing an interview where the guy said [<em>adopts American drawl*], ?So, do you ever go outback and just get on that rock and think?? It&#8217;s like you&#8217;d wander for a few miles to Ayers Rock just so you could think! [*Laughs</em>] They really did have fantasies about kangaroos hopping down the main street.</p>
<p><img class="c" data-src="/images/3011095/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Did the Gurus? hiatus from 1997 until 2003 prolong the band&#8217;s existence?</strong><br/>
DF: Yeah, maybe. It&#8217;s obviously one of life&#8217;s great unponderables &#8211; we&#8217;ll never know. It wasn&#8217;t a constructed thing. We were serious about the break-up. I thought it was the thing to do. But the band didn&#8217;t want to die so seriously, so it warmed itself back to life. I learnt a few things through experiences I had with Antenna [which Faulkner formed with Kim Salmon in 1998]. I discovered that thing called ?the group personality?, which the Hoodoo Gurus had and I&#8217;d taken for granted. When Antenna started it was like four individuals working and making great music but it was a little more hit and miss. And about four or five months later this chemistry took hold where there was this group dynamic and it felt like a real band. And we had a much better compass about what was going to be a fruitful area to explore and what would be a dead-end. It wasn&#8217;t about narrowing down your areas of possibility, it was about having a sense of who you are and what was right &#8211; and not ending up dull.</p>
<p>The Gurus have that. I can write a song that I think is pretty good and go and play it with the Gurus and it turns out flat &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t work.  Another song I might think is just alright, but the band turns it into something monstrous and fantastic &#8211; that&#8217;s monstrous good, not bad [<em>laughs</em>]. The band just has this filter, which is not constructed or contrived. It just knows what it wants.</p>
<p>BS: It&#8217;s like Godzilla!</p>
<p>DF: That&#8217;s exactly right.</p>
<p><strong>In that context, I understand when you went into the studio to record <em>Purity of Essence</em> that the band gelled like it hadn&#8217;t in a long time.   Why do you think that happened?</strong><br/>
DF: There was one remarkable day, which was one of the most remarkable days in my entire musical career. We were in there for nine hours and we got eight songs and no misses &#8211; half the album in one day in rehearsal. Everything we touched went to gold. It was only the next day we scratched ourselves and thought, ?What happened?? It was like a trance. There&#8217;d been this weird synchronicity thing going on with this record the whole way through. Obviously, there&#8217;d been hiccups &#8211; the mix didn&#8217;t pan out. That was the first dead-end we hit and we thought, ?Fuck, this record could fall over right here.?  So we had to re-organise and we got [legendary producer] Ed Stasium in to help out and now it sounds fantastic. But generally it seemed like the record made itself.</p>
<p><strong>Can I ask you about the track ?I Hope You&#8217;re Happy? from the new album, which makes some pointed observations about people pursuing sectoral activities of the modern age. Do the lyrics in that song have any relevance to people in your social circle?</strong><br/>
DF: Yes, they do. It&#8217;s a very personal song, actually. I have slightly changed the actual story, but it&#8217;s one song that I&#8217;m sure someone is going to be feeling quite delicate about. It&#8217;s a totally true song.  You have friends who get into things and you say, ?I can&#8217;t go there with you, but good luck &#8211; you&#8217;re on your own.? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p>There are about three songs &#8211; including ?A Few Home Truths?, which is a bit bitchy &#8211; that are quite personal. A friend of mine from The Fleshtones, has a song on one of their albums which is all about screwing around on the road. It&#8217;s called ?Pickin? Pickin?. I said, ?How the hell do you play this song for your wife?  What would she think??  And he said, ?She knows &#8211; a writer writes? [<em>laughs</em>]. So that&#8217;s our excuse.</p>
<p>[<em>With the label PR person now gesticulating frantically to me to wind the interview up as the band&#8217;s next appointment &#8211; an on-air interview with Richard Stubbs at the ABC studios in Southbank &#8211; rapidly approaches, I cut past another six questions (including one about the possibility of an official Victims re-issue) to ask one final question.</em>]</p>

<strong>I believe your former guitarist Roddy Radalj recently got on stage with you during a gig in Perth. How did that come about?</strong><br/>
DF: [<em>Looks at Brad*] Can we talk about this? [*Brad nods</em>] Rod went through a bit of a health crisis. He had a brain tumour.</p>
<p>BS: It was actually on his audio nerve, and they had to sever that nerve to cut the tumour out. He had to shave his hair and he has this big scar. Of course, his hair has grown back now and he&#8217;s impossibly handsome again! He contacted me because he&#8217;d heard that I&#8217;d had a health scare when I had a melanoma appear in my lymph nodes under my left arm. Rod got my email address somehow, and because he&#8217;d had his own health scare it had given him cause to reflect on his own life. I&#8217;d always thought there had been a little bit of tension between the two of us because I&#8217;d replaced him in the band and then things started going places with the Gurus.</p>
<p>DF: He got quite bitter even though he quit. [<em>Laughs</em>] It was like we&#8217;d sacked him, but he&#8217;d quit.</p>
<p>BS: I felt he was a bit hostile to me, even though he says now that was never the case. Either way, he reached out to me in a show of solidarity. And it really buried the hatchet with a lot of bad blood that I felt had been between the two of us. So he came to the show in Perth. And we started getting on like best mates and talking like we&#8217;d been friends forever.</p>
<p>DF: When he came to the show I said, ?Why don&#8217;t you get up on stage with us?? And Rod loves that, so he was right into it. It was fun, and I&#8217;d happily do it again. But he might need a rehearsal next time &#8211; he&#8217;d forgotten a bit!</p>
