<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Oh Mercy</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Alexander Gow)</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000393">Privileged Woes</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
Most likely on recording our second album, of which we are currently writing.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m surprised we made the shortlist, that&#8217;s satisfying enough. I&#8217;m no bookmaker or mathematician.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
Couldn&#8217;t tell you why we should win, but I can tell you that I would very much like to win. Being able to fund a second album thus potentially staying independent is a very exciting prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
All the shortlisted acts are great. I particularly enjoy Kid Sam and Lisa Mitchell&#8217;s music. </p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
My favourite album on 2009 was Rowland S Howard&#8217;s <em>Pop Crimes</em>. I don&#8217;t know if he was in the running, but the fact remains it&#8217;s an outstanding album by one of Australia&#8217;s most talented songwriters and guitar players.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Lisa Mitchell  </h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em>Wonder</em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m working on my second album and I haven&#8217;t got a decent microphone of my own yet. I&#8217;m always borrowing, not that I&#8217;m against borrowing, but maybe I should just go and buy one and stop being annoying. Maybe I could use that money to buy it. I&#8217;d put the leftovers towards the next video budget and make something really magical.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
I am in big big love with a lot of the other records that have been nominated. I think it has a decent chance though. I&#8217;m just flattered that the record was nominated at all.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
Well, I think I should win because the record is good. I don&#8217;t think I should win because I think there are people on that list that could use the money and recognition more than I could. It&#8217;s a warming feeling to see it being recognised. </p>
<p><em>Wonder</em> was produced by Dann Hume, and, along with a few other helpers along the way, we made this album ourselves, both quite naively, although it&#8217;s rare to hear either of us admit it. Dann, not having produced an album before, and me, never having recorded one, were a funny pair. Like two Labradors trying to hide their dopiness at the beginning of the project. I think we were both slightly shocked and delighted with the reaction it has received so far.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
Oh Mercy&#8217;s maiden full-length [<em>Privileged Woes*] produced by Miles Wooten, is so refreshing and mesmerising. Sarah Blasko&#8217;s [*As Day Follows Night</em>] is a pleasingly brooding listen. I&#8217;m so intrigued by Bertie Blackman&#8217;s songs. Oh, I don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re all stirring in their own ways.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
So many people! So many bands! What about Whitely&#8217;s new album [<em>Go Forth Find Mammoth*]? What about Washington&#8217;s album [*How To Tame Lions</em> EP]? Gosh!</p>
<p/>
<h2>Black Cab</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000400">Call Signs</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
Probably something useful like recording a better sounding new album or doing a proper Aus tour which we&#8217;ve lacked the funds to do properly since starting out in 2004. Be nice to blow it all on one insane recording project &#8211; like getting Phil Spector to mix a 7&#8243; single by correspondence plus the odd visit to Corcoran State Prison (which probably has some pretty neat acoustics). We probably won&#8217;t do this.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re still astounded we&#8217;re even in the shortlist, so who knows. I guess anything&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
We could win because we try to make interesting albums that hopefully don&#8217;t sound like too many other things out there, that are unique in their own way. Because we&#8217;ve never expected any kind of financial gain from being involved in music we&#8217;ve been able to craft music that interests and excites us, with the goal of sustaining interest over the course of a full album. If enough judges reckon this approach is worthy and valid in an age of music-stuffed iPods and file-sharing then we might have a shot at the cherry. But everyone who&#8217;s nominated is worthy given they&#8217;re all putting themselves out there.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re a little uncomfortable with the idea of ranking artists given anyone who gets a decent release together, builds an audience or scene and performs live regularly deserves kudos. We have lots of time for Ms Blasko and Kid Sam, and suspect Lisa Mitchell will go on to actually make shitloads in music despite the <em>Australian Idol</em> thing. But in terms of who could make the best use of the cash to do some good things, I&#8217;d say Kid Sam.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
Would have liked to see Roland S get a posthumous nod although his final album was maybe a little too harrowing (and now seems even more so). The latest Grand Salvo album [<em>Soil Creatures</em>] is also pretty good. But St Helens were the biggest miss I think &#8211; they are really exceptional both live and on record.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Lucie Thorne</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em>Black Across The Field</em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
Well, its not something I&#8217;ve been thinking too much about, but it&#8217;d sure make a whole bunch of stuff a whole lot easier &#8211; the making of the next record, the next overseas tour. They&#8217;re the sort of things you make happen anyway, one way or another, but with that kind of support it&#8217;d really take the pressure off. And it&#8217;d even mean having a bit of a break from constant touring, and that luxury of more time to work on the next album certainly holds a lot of appeal.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
Ah, pretty slim I should think, but it seems like a sweet little victory to have made the shortlist, no?</p>
<p>**Why do you think you should win? Who, other than you, deserves the<br/>
prize?**<br/>
Come on, what kind of questions are these? Here are nine very different and very good albums. The whole business of prize picking seems like a pretty arbitrary process in many ways, doesn&#8217;t it? And this year&#8217;s shortlist is an interesting one, partly for its diversity, partly cause it includes a bunch of us who probably don&#8217;t have the kind of national profile that some other year&#8217;s lists have had. So who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
There are so many great records being made in Australia at the moment, and of course many of them stay right under the radar. Some of my favourite Aussie albums of 2009 have been by Kim Dellavedova, The Necks, Tobias Hengeveld, Tina Harrod and Kes Band.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Bertie Blackman</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000368">Secrets &amp; Lies</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
I will probably buy 30,000 $1 kittens and let them loose with the specific instructions to breed, infiltrate houses via cuteness and then veraciously promote my music. Let&#8217;s call it a feline marketing initiative. Don&#8217;t steal my idea! I know where you dwell!</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
Apparently Betfair have me at 2-1, but Bad Bet have me at 30-1, so I&#8217;m not quite sure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
Because there is a nasty gap on my shelf, just the right AMP award  size. Also I need the $30,000 to make some more noise with my creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
Anyone who has the courage and perseverance to pursue their dreams and soul. And maybe Lambchop, the lamb puppet. He&#8217;s rad.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
Everyone else that wasn&#8217;t nominated.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">The Mess Hall</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Cec Condon)</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000501">For The Birds</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
I think we&#8217;d probably put it towards heading back overseas and I&#8217;d say this time around, Jed and I would each keep a bit of cash for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ve probably got Buckley&#8217;s and none this time around!</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
 Because nobody has won it twice so far!</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
I honestly haven&#8217;t heard any of the other albums on there, except for Sarah&#8217;s album, which I like, so I&#8217;ll say Blasko!</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
If I were judging I think I&#8217;d have Bridezilla and Rowland S Howard on the list.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Sarah Blasko</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000335">As Day Follows Night</a></em></p>
<p>Too famous; didn&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Urthboy</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em>Spitshine</em></p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d hoard it. But first I&#8217;d get it swapped for change &#8211; dollar coins preferably &#8211; and put it in jars.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
If I won I think I&#8217;d feel like Steven Bradbury winning gold in the Winter Olympics, skating past as the others fell over.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;d be a great day for hip-hop. Outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
Black Cab. I&#8217;m no expert but some of the other nominees are pretty great. Bertie Blackman should write for Christina Aguilera. (I mean that as a compliment).</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
From a hip-hop perspective, Horrorshow&#8217;s <em>Inside Story</em> was pretty remarkable.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Kid Sam</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong><br/>
<em><a href="/releases/2000226">Kid Sam</a></em> </p>
<p><strong>How would you spend the $30,000?</strong><br/>
So many ways to spend it! We could buy a nice Prius to tour around in. Or we could just throw it on the carpet in 50 dollar notes and roll around in it. Realistically though, buying a few new instruments, getting some recording done and touring costs would probably take care of a large chunk of it, which would be really helpful, of course.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate your chances?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really hard to say. We certainly didn&#8217;t expect to get this far and we&#8217;re up against some amazing artists. The best I could say at this stage is, ?We stand a one in nine chance, I guess!? It is great that the prize is judged totally independently of fame or album sales. </p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you should win?</strong><br/>
Whoever won it would be deserving of it, out of the current field.</p>
<p><strong>Who, other than you, deserves the prize?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m quite partial to <em>Privileged Woes</em> by Oh Mercy. </p>
<p><strong>Who do you think the judges overlooked?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s always so much great music around and it simply can&#8217;t make it all in, so I wouldn&#8217;t expect everything I like to make the cut, but it would have been great to see McKisko&#8217;s <em>Glorio</em> or the self-titled Psuche  album in there.</p>
