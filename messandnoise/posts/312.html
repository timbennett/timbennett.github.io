                <h3>For his second record, &#8216;Mostly Winter Sometimes Spring&#8217;, Sydney-based singer-songwriter <strong>BRIAN CAMPEAU</strong> set himself the unique challenge of using a different instrument on each track.

<h2>?Like This One? </h2>
<p>This is one of two vocal tracks on the album. The other one, ?Thank You?, also has djembe. I wrote this in Thailand regarding someone I was doubting. Turns out I was right to doubt. It&#8217;s got about 16 different vocals takes on it, and was done within an hour, which I was pretty happy about.</p>
<h2>?Then Came the Sun?</h2>
<p>This is my melodica track. The song is about a shitty, yet introspective time, which took ages to get better. Instrumentally, I layered about 10 different melodica tracks for the melodic side of the song, and created the beat by hitting the melodica with its mouthpiece, scratching it, throwing it and occasionally pitch-shifting it.</p>
<h2>?Who Cares??</h2>
<p>I wrote this song in about 10 minutes, which is extremely rare. I had a good guitar bit which ran a six count over a four count, and the lyrics came partially from an influence of Ayn Rand books. A friend of mine reckons this song is too long, but screw her. I like the length. This is my acoustic steel-string track.</p>
<h2>?Gone For You?</h2>
<p>This one features Zoe Hauptmann on the upright bass. She got the chart for the song about 15 minutes before recording. She is a monster of a player, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier to get her on this. The drum track comes from Jason Mannell playing brushes on the back of another upright bass. This song was also written in Thailand, and it could be argued that this is my first jazz tune.</p>
<h2>?Denial?</h2>
<p>The album was originally named <em>The 4 Stages of Grief</em>, but some deemed that to be too depressing. This track &#8211; the first of the four stages ?was played on the glockenspiel. It&#8217;s all pretty random, and a bit Cornelius. Some tracks are reversed, some spliced, some pitch-shifted. Its really more of a mood track that helps join ?Gone For You? to ?What May Kill?.</p>
<h2>?What May Kill?</h2>
<p>OK, so I went to the local pawn shop and saw a shitty old nylon string guitar for $80 bucks. I played it and it was fine, took it home and ripped all the frets off. So this song features a fretless nylon string guitar. It&#8217;s still awesome to play. Everything was done in one improvised take.</p>
<h2>?Anger?</h2>
<p>I got Julia Stockdale to play flute on this one. It&#8217;s basically a reprise of ?Like This One?, and is supposed to help the whole thing sound like an album, rather than just a collection of songs.</p>
<h2>?Throwing Blame?</h2>
<p>I wrote this one on the guitar ages ago about, well, throwing blame. The lyrics are too self explanatory for me to bother explaining them now. Kate Adams features on the cello, and the track in the end sounds quite classical and still folky. I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I layered about 10 different melodica tracks for the melodic side of the song, and created the beat by hitting the melodica with its mouthpiece, scratching it, throwing it and occasionally pitch-shifting it.?</p></blockquote>
<h2>?Depression? </h2>
<p>The third of the four stages of grief, this one is fully improvised on the acoustic steel string. I thought about extending it afterwards, but I think it&#8217;s good enough as it is.</p>
<h2>?Cain and Abel?</h2>
<p>This is my harmonium track. John Seamonkey lent it to me, and it was a gorgeous instrument. I started by putting simple chords down, and then layering them until there was about seven different melodic takes. I then approached the percussion much the same way as I did with ?Then Came the Sun?. I&#8217;m really happy with this track.</p>
<h2>?Kicking a Fuss?</h2>
<p>This is my electric guitar track. One track features me tapping chords out, which ends up sounding a bit like something a piano would play because of the arpeggio. Then I tuned the guitar down and added a bass track. Then I took my slide and rubbed it against the string like a violin bow. This is where that really layered pad sound comes from. Lyrically, the song is about people who don&#8217;t listen very well.</p>
<h2>?Reinventing Myself?</h2>
<p>I was listening to a few female guitar virtuosos when I wrote this, and wondered why there were so few. Style-wise, I was also trying to play my guitar differently. I came up with a part that involved playing and hitting the instrument at the same time. Musically, the track is actually performed on a sitar. I think there&#8217;s something like 30 layers here.</p>
<h2>?Acceptance?</h2>
<p>The fourth stage of grief. This track, performed on the classical guitar, is also purely improvised. I was actually just trying to get a good sound out of my guitar, and this came out.</p>
<h2>?Thank You?</h2>
<p>This is my recognition track for all those who helped with the making of my album &#8211; whether they lent an instrument, performed on the album, or performed but didn&#8217;t make it on. It&#8217;s almost all vocal except for the djembe track. Sounds a bit like a Gregorian chant.</p>
<h2>?The Roots To What&#8217;s Been Set?</h2>
<p>My sax song starring Ruth Wells and Sam Paver (both from The Bakery). This is kind of a ?fuck you? to big parts of the music scene. I believe in creativity and originality (without, of course, compromising the song itself). There are far too many people out there who aren&#8217;t pushing themselves creatively. And major labels, and many radio stations, seem to be supporting this laziness. And, yes, the last words of this song (and the album) are: ?Eat fucking shit.?</p>
