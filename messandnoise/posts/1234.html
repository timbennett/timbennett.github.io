                <h3>The debut LP from Kraut-psych sages Krakatau pairs two multi-section tracks recorded live outside in 2012 with a middle track constructed in the studio from looped and altered organ phrases, explain <strong>DYLAN LIEBERMAN<em>* and **JAMES TOM**.

<p>Recorded in 2012, <em>Water Near a Bridge</em> was conceived at a time when the band was about to undergo changes. Our then bass player, Charlie, was about to embark on an exchange to Canada studying psychology. Our style and influences were changing and we had been playing live for two years without recording.</p>
<h2>?Riddells Creek?  </h2>
<p>Dylan Lieberman: The opening track on the album encompasses much of what the band had accomplished musically &#8211; from its inception to the point of this recording. In hindsight, the track seemed to come together rather effortlessly, perhaps the product of a growth spurt in the band&#8217;s stylistic infancy. I had played drums for <a href="/releases/2000978">The Fearless Vampire Killers</a> prior to forming Krakatau; the switch in styles opened up interesting new territories for exploration, something I felt I sorely needed. The composition&#8217;s ending is one of my favourite moments on the album, despite recalling memories of the bitter coldness we endured on the day of recording.</p>
<p>James Tom: The day of recording at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddells_Creek">Riddells Creek</a> was stressful for me, to say the least. I was directing a film crew using limited 16mm film stock (which these days is very expensive) and playing in the band. The weather was 8 degrees Celsius, making it difficult to perform the last portion of the track, and we had limited daylight for exposure and to get a good take of the track. </p>

<p/>
<p>The track is more accurately three works that we managed to piece together for the performance. The first section, ?Stinging Petal?, was an exploration of a technique where I would play my organ through delay and harmonise/play of the delay modulations. We were listening to a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol<em>Vuh</em>(band">Popol Vuh</a>) at the time but more so this is an expression for my long-running love of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley">Terry Riley</a> and his long-improvised organ pieces from the early ?70s, with our own flavour I hope!</p>
<p>The second part [?Mourning Mass?] was taken from a longer work I used to perform in early solo and duo shows I would do with Joshua Bach, and the final section [?John Stoat?] was sort of a new expression of probably what was closest to our live sets at the time, and the most rock part of the whole record. I sometimes wonder whether we should have jammed that part out for longer or included another similar track to the LP.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?All Water Near a Bridge?  </h2>
<p>James: We originally intended the record to be a single with just two live tracks. While listening to the two tracks in the studio being rewound and played at different speeds, it came to me: why not loop, pitch and repeat organ phrases to make a new track? In the weeks to come, producer Shags Chamberlain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heldon">pictured above left] helped create and arrange the piece. At the time I was listening to a whole lot of minimal music and weirder stuff like [Heldon</a>, so in a sense this piece was trying to make use of ideas those artists had established. Apart from the obvious wordplay of the track&#8217;s title, I also like the more literal interpretation of it being created out of samples from Riddells Creek, almost like cascades of sound floating away in the creek behind where we played.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Kuriere?  </h2>
<p>Dylan: The final track on the album &#8211; the entirety of side B &#8211; was recorded in the backyard of the house where James and I live, and features Joshua Bach on synthesiser. ?Kuriere? is the consummation of a brief period in the band&#8217;s lifetime when we performed in an organ/synthesiser/drums configuration &#8211; no bass guitar. To my ears the piece has a rather mystical, ethereal sound, an aesthetic that&#8217;s rounded out by Joshua&#8217;s concluding synth solo (subtitled ?From Here to Where to Where??).</p>
<p>James: It&#8217;s funny because this track contains both the oldest and the newest written material included on the LP (not counting the studio-constructed ?All Water Near A Bridge?). The second section of the track, ?Leviathan Theme?, was always a crowd favourite when we performed it live, and possibly the first ever piece I wrote after teaching myself to play keyboard. I suppose there was a lot of Berlin Krautrock influence coming into the writing of this track (i.e. early Tangerine Dream, ambient Ash Ra Tempel tracks, Agitation Free, etc.). The title of the track represents this well.</p>
<p>By this period in the band&#8217;s history we&#8217;d started writing and performing more complex material, which sort of goes to show sometimes a simple melodic passage with subtle variations is all a song needs, even for a longer piece like ?Kuriere?. There were originally dog bark sounds in one of the good takes of this track because our housemate let her dog outside so she could have sex with her boyfriend. Interesting fact!  </p>
