                <h3>Like Johnny Cash, Jimmy Little&#8217;s career has spanned several generations, numerous artistic reinventions, acclaimed covers albums and even a Christian film. And while he may be semi-retired from music, he tells <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> that he still has several new albums and a series of reissues in the works.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3010424/440x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Jimmy Little is an Australian musical giant. In the 1950s and ?60s, the now 72-year-old became the most successful indigenous Australian singer/guitarist of his time. Over more than 35 albums, he has slipped comfortably into rustic country songs, brassy standards, whispered pop, reverent gospel and even reggae. After an early career peak as a smooth-voiced balladeer in the model of American superstar Jim Reeves, Little only extended his reach. He pursued acting, appearing on stage and in the 1960 Christian film <em>Shadow Of The Boomerang* as well as Wim Wenders? *Until The End Of The World</em> (1991). He took a break from recording between 1980 and 1995 to teach part-time and spend more time with his family, although he continued to play shows.</p>
<p>Brendan Gallagher of Karma County guided Little to renewed success with 1999?s <em>The Messenger</em>, an ARIA-winning album of cover songs by the likes of Paul Kelly, Crowded House, The Reels, The Go-Betweens, and Nick Cave, including The Church&#8217;s global hit ?Under The Milky Way?. Subsequent albums saw him tackle songs by Bernard Fanning and Dave Graney as well as international artists from Neil Young and U2 to Elvis Costello and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Little has always been better known for singing other people&#8217;s songs than writing his own, which isn&#8217;t an insult. He gently and lovingly makes everything his, feeling out the soul of a song regardless of its original era or genre. He&#8217;s written his own songs as well, most notably such odes to his homeland as ?Australia Downunder? and ?Thankyou For The Dreamtime?.</p>
<p>In addition to his induction into the ARIA Hall Of Fame, Little has received the Golden Gospel Award and an Order of Australia Medal, and has been named a Living National Treasure. He was the subject of the documentary film <em>Gentle Journey</em> and has mined his personal experiences with diabetes, kidney failure and a kidney transplant for the Jimmy Little Foundation, reaching out to indigenous communities on a variety of health issues. He has represented Australia at home and abroad, and is known for his deep kindness as much as for his wide-ranging artistic talent.</p>
<p>?Everywhere I go, I feel like a part of me is there. I feel the whole nation is part of my home,? Little told me prior to a show late last year at Melbourne&#8217;s Corner Hotel, some 10 years after the release of <em>The Messenger</em>. With five new albums and a series of reissues in the words, Little is enjoying what he describes as a ?new lease on life?. </p>
<p><strong>How often are you playing live these days?</strong><br/>
Maybe one weekend a month. Or two shows on a weekend and a fortnight later, another two shows. I&#8217;ve really semi-retired now, but I still enjoy it as much as ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I always felt like I had one foot on either side of the bank. Most of my mum&#8217;s people were in Victoria, and my dad&#8217;s in New South Wales. I felt like both states have a claim on me.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How do you decide what to play, having released nearly three dozen albums?</strong><br/>
A little bit [has to do with] the venue I&#8217;m working at, to give me an idea what age group and generation of music lovers. I try to mix it up between [songs from] my teens and 20s and 30s. I&#8217;ll look at the audience and if it&#8217;s 60-40 towards the younger set, I&#8217;ll try to sing the songs they are more familiar with. If it&#8217;s an audience of my generation, I tend to go towards the evergreen classics. But they&#8217;re all classics; just a different time and different audience. Being in the business a long time, you get to have quite a repertoire to call on.</p>
<p><strong>Do you accept requests?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I do. I don&#8217;t publicly announce it, but I&#8217;m happy to shift [a set list] around a little or maybe sing a medley of requests. Either way, I try to please everyone, to a point.</p>
<p><strong>Younger people know you more from <em>The Messenger</em> and the few albums after that. Was that partly the appeal of making those albums?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I wanted to introduce myself to a younger audience, because I&#8217;d been entertaining their grandparents when I was in my teens and 20s. And the ones that grew up with me in my generation, I would sing their songs, so now I&#8217;m singing to the young adults as well.</p>
<p><strong>How do you approach singing a standard like ?Danny Boy? versus a Go-Betweens or Nick Cave song?</strong><br/>
Well, the way I interpret it myself is: they&#8217;re all about love, heartbreak and healing, and little stories just about everybody can relate to. </p>
<p><strong>I recently found one of your old albums on vinyl, <em>The Country Sound Of Jimmy Little</em>, from 1969. It&#8217;s really great, including the choice of songs. Is it available on CD?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m glad you found that. I&#8217;m trying to reissue those [early albums] on CD. I find that with the others I buy of earlier times, I can only get the albums. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to try to get out a choice of my early material, so people can say, ?Oh, that&#8217;s Jimmy Little back in the ?60s and the ?50s and the ?70s.? [My voice may] sound a little different now, and I don&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s still the same spirit, the same feeling, the same presence. So I want to reintroduce myself.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3010426/640x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>You pursued country music for years, but you also did pop, folk, rock, and gospel. Do you love all those genres equally, or are certain ones closer to your heart?</strong><br/>
All songs to me are worth hearing and listening to and being played, because of the songwriters. I try to do justice to the song, [whether it&#8217;s] by Elton John or Jim Reeves or Neil Diamond, or folk songs by Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. I grew up with all these songs, and I listened to them and liked them. I don&#8217;t try to compete; I just try to present them in their original form, but with a little bit of me in there somewhere. I also sing reggae. I did Bob Marley&#8217;s ?Beautiful Woman? and ?Is This Love?. So it&#8217;s a challenge to not change dramatically in my presentation but keep the voice, getting that romantic message and saying that love songs belong to every era. As a matter of liking particular voices and arrangements and musical sounds, to me it&#8217;s all variety. And variety is the spice of life. </p>
<p><strong>Having sang and played so many other people&#8217;s songs, how do you approach writing your own songs?</strong><br/>
I try to be exact, if I can use that term. To me, singing one of my own songs is really from the heart. I try to get the message true and strong. When I sing a song about my mum and dad and my home territory, I really sort of daydream throughout the song and reflect within myself about those early days. I also try to introduce a song, lyrically and spiritually, to say this is one of the songs in the town and home I grew up in, and it&#8217;s all about mum and dad and family. </p>
<p><strong>And you were born near Echuca [in Victoria]?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Just down the river a little way and across the borderline of the old Murray into New South Wales. But I always felt like I had one foot on either side of the bank. Most of my mum&#8217;s people were in Victoria, and my dad&#8217;s in New South Wales. I felt like both states have a claim on me. When I look at the whole nation, I&#8217;ve made friends in this state, that territory, and that region. When I think about my own ancestors from Queensland, the Territory, Victoria, and NSW, I feel like I&#8217;m spread all over, like butter on toast. [<em>Laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>Your father, Jimmy Little Sr, was a singer and dancer, right?</strong><br/>
Yeah, he was a comedian, dancer, musician, and writer. Mum was also a singer and a Swiss yodeler. Back in their days, yodeling was really popular. Also, my dad played the gum leaf. In our region, we played the gum leaf, and in the northern areas of Australia, they play the didgeridoo. So it&#8217;s from the same tree, only different notes and different ways of playing.</p>
<p><strong>So you just blow on a gum leaf to make different sounds?</strong><br/>
Yeah, just a leaf off the tree. You have to get that particular one to get the music out of it. I&#8217;ve tried and tried but I still can&#8217;t play the leaf as much as I play the guitar. [<em>Laughs</em>] But I&#8217;m proud to know that my dad was one of the many, many great players during that era. </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3010427/640x495-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>I read that you were entering talent contests when you were as young as 16.</strong><br/>
Yeah, talent contests were fun. We had friendly competitions with [other] towns. We won a few and then we lost a few. The different artists who performed in those contests carried on in their own way and their own style. It was also a starting thing for those who had natural ability. </p>
<p><strong>When you were touring Australia during all those years, did you ever play overseas?</strong><br/>
Only once. I had a few opportunities, I must say, but I declined. It never really eventuated until I represented Australia in the WOMAD [World Of Music, Arts, and Dance] Festival, which went to London, Canada, New York, Singapore, [and elsewhere]. I had about two weeks touring abroad, and I had a great time.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if growing up along the Murray River had a big influence on you.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I was always kind of a dreamer. I used to watch all the movies, and I&#8217;m still a great movie buff. Particularly musicals. And from that I learnt a lot of songs, and from growing up with the radio in my ear every morning. Growing up backstage with mum and dad and all my other friends and relatives, there was no way I could ignore music being a grand part of my life. My brothers and sisters did likewise. </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve appeared in several movies yourself over the years.</strong><br/>
Yeah, that was one of my early passions. I wanted to do some stage acting, some radio acting, and possibly some bit parts in movies. I had the opportunity to do that in two major movies and a few short features.</p>

<strong>I know you starred in <em>Shadow Of The Boomerang</em> in 1960 and did the title song for it.</strong><br/>
Yeah. It was something close to the heart and still is, telling the story of indigenous Australians growing up in two worlds. </p>
<p><strong>What was it like being an indigenous performer in the ?50s?</strong><br/>
It was exciting. It was opening the minds of people and a view on actors in theatre at that time. Not long after, a lot of young actors came along and made international names for themselves. I feel like a bit of a pioneer in that area, opening a few more doors. I&#8217;m glad I was opening new ways, back in the era, for people to part of the present. </p>
<p><strong>I want to ask about a specific song you wrote, ?Australia Downunder? (1974). It&#8217;s a sort of tour of the country through the lyrics.</strong><br/>
Yeah, well, that&#8217;s what I had in mind initially, to include all of the states and their landmarks. But the real reason I sang was, I was going to perform for the troops in Vietnam. I wanted to remind them of home. My wife and I sat down with the Australian map and wrote it in an hour, if you can believe it, and rhymed it in such a way that appealed to us to perform it for the troops. Then I finished up [by] performing it right across the nation and recording it. </p>
<p><strong>I know there&#8217;s a lot to talk about, but I was wondering if you could give me an overview of your charity work and community service and the <a href="http://www.jlf.org.au/">Jimmy Little Foundation</a>.</strong><br/>
OK, [there are] two main reasons. The first is to establish more dialysis machines closer to the [indigenous] communities. They have to travel so far and be away from home, so I [want to] create more awareness of maintaining good health and to the government and financial world that we would like more help in generating funds. The second is nutrition: better choices of food for all members, not just school kids. To get a health program going that can be seen as prevention from getting kidney and liver and different internal-organ diseases. So it&#8217;s a matter of spreading my word across the nation physically and artistically and culturally. That&#8217;s generally what I&#8217;m trying to do now.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve had some health issues of your own, including organ failure and a transplant. Do you think that helps people take you more seriously on the subject?</strong><br/>
I think so. I just came back from a week in one of the major communities to help launch the nutrition program. I went to the school and got the school to write a health song with the students. They&#8217;re singing it now and we&#8217;re going to record that. And I&#8217;ll be recording gospel albums with a message about health, culture, faith, and hope. So there&#8217;s a lot on my plate, but I&#8217;ll try to do as much as I can. [<em>Laughs</em>] That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m semi-retired [from music], just to get out there in the field as ?Dr Little?. But now I&#8217;m planning five albums to do over the next two years. I&#8217;ve taken on quite a bit to do, but I&#8217;ll space it out.</p>
<p><strong>What are the other albums you have planned?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m planning a gospel album with indigenous choirs. I&#8217;m also going to do a country album, an evergreen classics album, and an album with other indigenous artists, like a duet album. So I&#8217;m really going to be fairly busy, but I think I&#8217;ll get it done because everybody wants to come on board with me and share the load and the enjoyment. </p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s such a variety, and you&#8217;ve done everything from appearing with The Wiggles to singing a Triffids song with Kyle Minogue.</strong><br/>
And Olivia Newton-John, we did a single together [?Happy Day?]. I&#8217;ve already done a lot of duet singles that I can put on an album now. That&#8217;s in the pipeline as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like you&#8217;ve spanned an extraordinary amount of terrain?</strong><br/>
I think so. Once you get yourself established, you can spread yourself around more with your fellow artists. I&#8217;m a bit of a thinker, a dreamer, and a doer. </p>
