                <h3><strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> has a theory about the Meredith Music Festival: don&#8217;t sleep in.
</h3>

At 11am on a Saturday morning, The Meredith Supernatural Amphitheatre might as well be the setting of a George A Romero flick. Depending on the weather, it&#8217;s either a mud pit or a dustbowl, strewn with rubbish, and populated by zombies sluggishly searching for the brains they left somewhere between the Pink Flamingo Bar and Bush Camp at 5am. The coffee line (cue: grinding jokes) is so long it snakes up the hill to the compost loos, while the Community Tucker Tent is generally overrun by garbled requests for bacon-and-eggs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing immediately auspicious about playing at this time &#8211; following the City Of Ballarat Brass Band and while thousands of punters are still asleep &#8211; but for as long as I&#8217;ve been going to Meredith (and even earlier), it&#8217;s become a showcase of sorts for some very, very good bands indeed. Whether by design or coincidence, looking back at the past seven years reveals an interesting trend: play 11am on Meredith Saturday and you&#8217;re almost certainly destined for bigger and better things. </p>

Take Melbourne&#8217;s Ground Components, for example, who made an ?impressive? festival debut in 2003 off the back of an excellent debut EP. A year later, they were playing to a heaving, albeit drenched amphitheatre at midnight on Friday (although that gig has since been overshadowed by The Dirty Three&#8217;s ?lightning storm? moment that same year.) The roll-call since then has been equally impressive: My Disco (2004), Eddy Current Suppression Ring (2005), <a href="/events/9774#review_448319">Snowman</a> (2006), The Devastations (2007), <a href="/events/2000138">Tame Impala</a>(2008) and Kid Sam (2009).</p>
<p>As Meredith&#8217;s 20th anniversary approaches, I spoke to some of the bands that have occupied the 11am slot over the years, as well as Sydney duo ky?, who will be making their festival debut on Saturday morning. You&#8217;d be a fool for sleeping in.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">2004: My Disco</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Ben Andrews)</h2>
<p><strong>Their recollections:</strong> ?That was the craziest Meredith I&#8217;ve ever been to. We arrived the night before, where there was a horrendous storm and basically whoever had the misfortune of playing that night got a raw deal. I think we listened to Ground Components set on the radio ?cause it was so brutal outside. We were pretty worried about what the morning would be like for our set, but when we woke up it was clear blue skies and damn near paradise. We woke everyone up with our high decibel racket and at the time, we had never played longer than 25 minutes before, and we were slated for a 45-minute time slot! So we extended some of the jams and I broke a string which added several minutes to our set. Pretty funny. Oh, and the band that followed us were Wolfmother, believe it or not.</p>
<p>?Apart from the Friday night storm, the other well-documented highlight that year was The Dirty Three playing at sundown on the Saturday night as a lightening storm passed over. We had a great spot up the front but when the band started to play, my girlfriend at the time passed out, so I had to drag her way back past the mixing desk in order to get her some air and regain consciousness. As it turns out, the view of the band and the passing storm was much better from up on the hill, so it all worked out.?</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3016589/640x416-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>What they were doing at the time:</strong> ?We had only put out a 7? and an EP at that stage, but we had recently launched something or other in Melbourne, and I remember this ?cause [Meredith co-organiser] Matt High himself came along to our launch as he&#8217;d heard good things about the band. He sent me a message the day after our launch saying, ?Mate, couldn&#8217;t stay last night but the band is incredible, please call me when you can.? I nearly jumped out of bed to phone him and when he offered us a spot on the festival I nearly died with excitement. It was pretty crazy of him to put a mostly unheard of post punk band from Melbourne on such a famous festival, but that&#8217;s the kind of guy that Matt is. The festival is really something for everyone, I guess &#8211; and that just plain rules.?</p>
<p><strong>What it meant in the context of their career:</strong> ?Essentially, it opened up doors that were otherwise closed between us and the Australian music industry. I remember Tim Pittman [promoter, Feel Presents] giving us a few support slots for his tours not long after that show, and saying to me, ?Saw you guys at Meredith, you woke me up it was so loud!? That&#8217;s always a compliment as far as My Disco are concerned. It was a great time for us to play the festival and it really opened the band up to a wider audience. Plus, 2004 was <em>the</em> year for Meredith as far as the history books are concerned, so it&#8217;s great to know that we were apart of it.?</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">2005: Eddy Current Suppression Ring</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Mikey Young)</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016590/448x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Their recollections:</strong> ?Feeling really teary and proud seeing all our friends were in the front row. It was hot, I think. Lots of bull ants, and I realised I have a total lack of preparation when it comes to camping.?</p>
<p><strong>What they were doing at the time:</strong> ?I think we had only recently released our second 7&#8243;. I remember selling them out of my backpack in the crowd after the show with Brendan [Huntley, singer]. I feel like we hadn&#8217;t played that many shows at that stage, maybe 15, so we were still pretty fresh and nervous.?</p>
<p><strong>What it meant in the context of their career:</strong> ?I&#8217;m pretty sure it meant a lot. we started to get better gig offers and luckily all the Meredith people seemed to really dig us and kept inviting back to that and Golden Plains, always giving us better slots in the line-up.?</p>
<p><strong>How it compared to their headline slot in 2009:</strong> ?There were similar feelings of nervousness. The headline slot was mind-blowing and left me feeling quite bewildered.?</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">2006: Snowman</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Joe McKee)</h2>
<p><strong>Our impressions:</strong> ?Occupying the 11am slot was Snowman who hail from sunny Perth. The irony wasn&#8217;t lost on anyone &#8211; least of all the guy behind me in a Bros T-shirt. Unlike the City of Ballarat Municipal Brass Band who began the day with regimented aplomb, Snowman sent abrasive shards through the audience. They screamed like banshees &#8211; and made arty noise from theremins, violins and other things that squealed. It was like having razorblades for breakfast.? (Full review <a href="/events/9774#review_448319">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Their recollections:</strong> ?The show was a lot of fun. We had the job of waking people from their drunken slumber. To this day those people probably still hate us for that very reason. I remember we all came to an agreement that we would be as loud and abrasive as possible that morning. We wanted to leave a lasting impression. I recall that it was sweltering hot. There were bush fires in the area throughout the week leading up to the festival so the air was heavy with smoke.?</p>
<p><strong>What they were doing at the time:</strong> ?We had recently released our debut album. We were on tour at the time and squeezed Meredith in too. We had to drive back to Melbourne to play some dingy venue that night, in fact. We just wanted to be waist-deep in dust camping at Meredith.?</p>
<p><strong>What it meant in the context of their career:</strong> ?To us, playing Meredith was a kind of benchmark, and an achievement. It meant we had arrived on a larger scale. We felt as though we had to prove ourselves to the audience and we felt like we did that. Opening the Saturday at Meredith has become somewhat of a prestigious task. It&#8217;s nice to be among those bands that have done so.?</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">2007: The Devastations</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Conrad Standish)</h2>
<p><strong>Their recollections:</strong> ?The show itself went pretty well from memory. Nothing went wrong. None of us were bummed afterwards. Even though it was so early in the day, the jetlag made us feel like it was 2am anyway, so it could have been worse. Volume was a factor, playing in the morning to people who were going to be hungover or coming down or whatever, and so we made it clear to our mixer that we had to be pretty fucking loud. After the show I&#8217;d engineered myself to remember as little as possible. I presume I had a blast. Though this ?blast? also led to a slightly underwhelming album launch at [Melbourne&#8217;s] The Toff two nights later. From Meredith I bummed a ride back to Melbourne with [local music personality] Mary Mihelakos and we listened to a lot of Dolly Parton. I was back in Berlin five days later.?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was with Gaz [Gareth Liddiard] from The Drones just before he stage invaded Jon Spencer with his pants round his ankles. A pivotal moment, and pretty life-affirming.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What they were doing at the time:</strong> ?[Third record] <em>Yes, U</em> had come out a couple of months earlier and we&#8217;d been touring Europe and the UK pretty heavily with that. When we got the offer for Meredith we were pretty surprised as well as excited. Firstly, we&#8217;d never been asked to do an Australian festival before; and secondly, it was a really nice way to come home. Our last Australian show had been in late 2005, I think, so it&#8217;d been a while. We also wanted to iron out any kinks in the set before getting back to Melbourne, as no one will ever judge you nearly as harshly as your friends will.?</p>
<p><strong>Their first Meredith?</strong> ?It was our first time playing there. I&#8217;d been once before as a punter in 2002 or so, disgracing myself all over the place. In the backstage area I got chased, and stung by a swarm of bees. I was with Gaz [Gareth Liddiard] from The Drones just before he stage invaded Jon Spencer with his pants round his ankles. A pivotal moment, and pretty life-affirming. Ask him about it sometime.?</p>
<p><strong>What it meant in the context of their career:</strong> ?I couldn&#8217;t say, really. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever done a gig which felt like a real turning point in our careers as such. There did seem to be a good feeling towards the band in Australia at that point, which was really nice. <em>Yes, U</em> was being <a href="/news/2029698">well-received</a> and all that. I suppose playing at single-stage festivals like Meredith means that people who wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily see you, get to see you, for better or worse. All in all, it was a fun show, and a really good period within the band. If Devastations emerge again from deep-freeze, we&#8217;d definitely love to do it again. Maybe not at 11am, but we&#8217;d do it again.?</p>

<strong>Their recollections:</strong> ?I remember being really nervous. We sat backstage while the City of Ballarat Brass Band played and I got increasingly nervous. Kieran [Ryan, guitar/vocals] went on stage first and played a solo song while I drank some beer and ate a Tim Tam. I can&#8217;t remember the actual gig very well. All I remember is finding it hard to connect with Kieran, to lock into what he was playing. When we walked off stage I felt a little bit disappointed. Later, as I walked around the festival, a bunch of people told me how much they liked our set and that made me feel a lot better. I remember being surprised at the lack of bogans. Everyone seemed to be indie-fresh and good looking. In terms of bands Thee Oh Sees and Kes Band were probably my favourites.?</p>
<p><strong>What they were doing at the time:</strong> ?During 2009 we toured a lot and I found it really difficult to keep a job. During our tours I&#8217;d try to come back to Melbourne at the start of each week and work Mondays and Tuesdays. I got fired a couple of times within a month and soon after that the touring stopped. Around the time of Meredith I was pretty much just going to job network appointments and getting depressed.?</p>
<p><strong>What it meant in the context of their career:</strong> ?It was the first festival we played and we were excited to be part of it. I don&#8217;t know what it meant for our career and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever use the word ?career? to describe our musical endeavors. We got to play in front of thousands of people so I guess we felt like what we were doing meant something.?</p>

<p><strong>Will this be your first Meredith?</strong> ?Yes! I&#8217;ve never been ballot lucky.?</p>
<p><strong>Their expectations:</strong> ?I&#8217;ve heard the story of The Dirty Three playing at dusk in front of a lightning storm and everyone in the audience having a religious experience. I&#8217;m now expecting the whole festival to be like that.?</p>
<p><strong>Are you aware of the bands that have occupied that 11am slot over the years?</strong> ?No, I had no idea! Some of my favourite bands are on there though, and that&#8217;s making me nervous.?</p>
<p><strong>When was the last time you played so early?</strong> ?At school assemblies.?</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning on having an early one on Friday night?</strong> ?No! We&#8217;re a little bit granny at times, but I think we might just let our hair down.?</p>
