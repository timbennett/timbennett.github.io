                <h3>Ahead of an eight-day acoustic sojourn, Gareth Liddiard from The Drones tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> that he&#8217;s readying a solo disc &#8211; even though he&#8217;s done about five already.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002720/440x681-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="681"/><br/>
<strong>What prompted this current batch of solo shows? I imagine being in a band like The Drones would get a little all-encompassing at times.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a weird one. The more you enjoy it the better you are at it &#8211; So to go around doing it to death isn&#8217;t very helpful, but you kind of have to. The main reason for this bunch of shows is I like doing them and there was an opening on the calendar before the drones get working for the next straight year.</p>
<p><strong>Do these tours tend to re-energise you? Or make you more weary?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve never done a solo tour so I&#8217;m about to find out. When I do the shows in Melbourne they can go either way. They can leave you feeling good, or you start to wish you had a band behind you if things aren&#8217;t going well.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re playing at some beautiful theatres for the upcoming tour including Thornbury Theatre in Melbourne and Theatre Royal in Castlemaine. Did you handpick these venues?</strong><br/>
I guess so. I just figured I hadn&#8217;t played solo at any of them. The only one I&#8217;ve played in at all is the one in Brisbane [The Troubadour]. I&#8217;ve never seen the others.</p>
<p><strong>Does the setting of a show effect the way you approach it?</strong><br/>
Yeah, for sure. But it&#8217;s more about the human setting if you catch my drift. When you&#8217;re doing something that is just an acoustic guitar and a voice and a song, you can&#8217;t really fight indifference like you can with a band. So it helps to have people who listen to begin with. They have to make the first move. No one&#8217;s getting laid if they don&#8217;t. I like to make love to the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Are we likely to see a solo album anytime soon?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m starting one now I think. I&#8217;ve always wanted to, but I&#8217;ve finally found the will. From my point of view though I&#8217;ve made five already. What&#8217;s a solo record really? You write a bunch of tunes and get players you like to play them with you. I&#8217;ve been there before, but we have a band name rather than &#8220;Gareth Liddiard and The Whatevers?. That&#8217;s the only difference there unless your talking about Lenny Kravitz. It&#8217;s kind of confusing, so with the record that&#8217;s coming, it&#8217;ll just be me and an acoustic. It&#8217;s a very solo record. Don&#8217;t ask me when it&#8217;ll come out though.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the set-list going to draw on? Will there be some new material? Maybe some covers?</strong><br/>
There won&#8217;t be anything new. I have about six billion new tunes on the guitar but fuck-all words to go with them. I wish someone would offer me a soundtrack. It&#8217;s already finished. Covers? Maybe, I haven&#8217;t thought about that yet. I&#8217;ll try and play a bunch of stuff that usually doesn&#8217;t get to see much daylight. That&#8217;ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>The Drones&#8217; muscular twin-guitar attack sometimes overwhelms the lyrics. Do you see these shows as an opportunity to highlight the words?</strong><br/>
Yeah, for sure. And a chance to showcase these velvet pipes. It&#8217;s nice to play the songs with their words up front though. They seem to work okay both ways most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>As a solo performer, there&#8217;s naturally more of an emphasis on between-song audience interaction. Is it difficult having to be a stand-up comedian, a storyteller and a musician all in one?</strong><br/>
It just depends on your mood. I was a smartarse in class when I was little and there&#8217;s not a lot of difference between that and being onstage. If you&#8217;re in a shit mood, it&#8217;s a real drag; a real drag for everyone. </p>
<p>The oddest thing is during a good show, when everyone&#8217;s listening and you&#8217;re not thinking about anything other than what you&#8217;re meant to be doing, it can suddenly strike you how very alone and silly you seem, crapping on about a pile of depressing shit in front of a room full of people trying to have a Saturday night. It&#8217;s not that different to making a speech at school assemblies and feeling very awkward. But that&#8217;s when it can get funny, cause you feel like such a goose you start acting like one.</p>
<p><strong>Is the transition from Drones frontman to solo performer seamless, or do you have to put a lot of thought into it?</strong><br/>
The less thought the better. If you think too much, you just lock up. I run through the tunes quickly beforehand just to remember if i&#8217;ve forgotten anything. I tune up. That&#8217;s about it really.</p>
<blockquote><p>?During a good show &#8211; it can suddenly strike you how very alone and silly you seem, crapping on about a pile of depressing shit in front of a room full of people trying to have a Saturday night.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is there any solo performer that you look to as a benchmark?</strong><br/>
There are lots of good ones but my favorite solo thing would be the record <em>Live at the Old Quarter</em> by Townes Van Zandt. He could cast this really delicate spell and he does it on that record. It&#8217;s all quite brutal, clinically depressed stuff but it could be gone like a web in the morning, you know? And I really dig stuff like Sabicas and Toumani Diabate too. They don&#8217;t sing or anything, but they get the party started with no one&#8217;s help but their own. They are the real musicians. Sabicas especially, he is the greatest and there&#8217;s not a lot else to it.</p>
<p><strong>The Drones have released three albums in four years. Do you consider yourself a particularly prolific songwriter?</strong><br/>
No, I&#8217;m either useless or we tour too much. Or both. I always feel like we&#8217;re falling behind in the new song department. I feel guilty about it all. Then I get drunk and lash out at the band. Then I feel okay again.</p>
<p><strong>Are you working on a follow-up to <em>Havilah</em>? And when can we expect it?</strong><br/>
Yes and no. I&#8217;m getting an idea of what I don&#8217;t want to do next, so that&#8217;s gotta count for something. And if i&#8217;m starting out on a solo record, then certain odds and sods I come up with will be relegated to Drones-ness, the rest to the solo thing. You&#8217;re always working on something, only a coma could change that. I&#8217;m speaking for myself here, but I&#8217;m sure something similar is happening to the other three. Or other four. Burke [Reid, producer/engineer] is off and racing already, looking for somewhere fun to record. This week it&#8217;s Cuba. He certainly has the initiative. That&#8217;s all you need. Like with <em>Havilah</em>, he didn&#8217;t wait to be asked.</p>
<p><strong><em>Havilah</em> placed second in our critics and readers polls. Does that endorsement mean much to you? And do you consider the album a &#8220;success&#8221;?</strong><br/>
The endorsement&#8217;s great. Anything like that is a vindication but ultimately it&#8217;s not good to pay it that much mind. We started out doing exactly what we wanted which is what the people who invented music in caves did. We did that under the radar and it was easier to do when no one else was making a fuss. If you start listening to anything but the tick of your own clock then your going to suck ass. It just wouldn&#8217;t sound that good, so I don&#8217;t like to pay too much attention to it all.</p>
<p>Do I consider it [<em>Havilah</em>] a success? No. It&#8217;s just another in a long line of flops for The Drones. But I like it too.</p>
<p><strong>In hindsight, do you think your comments about rock critics in <a href=" http://www.messandnoise.com/news/3404868"><em>ampersand</em></a> were perhaps a little harsh? And what prompted them? I can count the amount of negative Drones reviews on one hand.</strong><br/>
Well, what I wrote should have been read and left in context. Do you sing the praises of all the other music publications and the individuals who write for them in the world? I doubt it. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.ampersandmagazine.com.au/files/Snapshots%20of%20Edition%20Zero.pdf">link</a> (pdf) for anyone who&#8217;s interested. I&#8217;d make a note of all of the bold print to start with. A journalist wrote that, it doesn&#8217;t actually have anything to do with Oxford uni.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can&#8217;t believe anyone would take anything in this article that seriously, because once you&#8217;ve read it you can also accuse me of being (among other things):</p>
<p>a. A proponent of Nazi Eugenics.<br/>
b. A nudist that hates music festivals.<br/>
c. A theatrophobic drunk with ADHD.<br/>
d. A rock&#8217;n?roller who thinks &#8220;rock&#8217;n?roll is pretty retarded&#8221;.<br/>
e. Chuck D&#8217;s friend.<br/>
f. A fairly intolerant guy all round.<br/>
g: A funny cunt.</p>
