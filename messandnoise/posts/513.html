                <h3>As they enter their 19th year, Sydney&#8217;s finest slackers Smudge have never been busier, drummer Alison Galloway tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014726/426x640-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Smudge&#8217;s drummer Alison Galloway has a half-an-hour window before she has to pick up her daughter from childcare. The former Waterfront Records mainstay and host of MTV&#8217;s <em>Didge Indie</em> is peppy, congenial and has a sing-song quality to her voice that suggests she&#8217;s been spending a lot of time with a toddler.</p>
<p>?I&#8217;ve got my three-year-old daughter at home most days, who I hang out with,? says Galloway, who also works part-time at a high school teaching kids with disabilities and special needs.</p>
<p>Smudge&#8217;s sporadic schedule suits Galloway down to the ground &#8211; even though they&#8217;ve been particularly active as they enter their 19th year. With bass player Adam Yee busy with his booking agency Mobile Industries and singer and chief songwriter Tom Morgan back in his hometown of Maitland, along the Hunter River in NSW, the band only reconvene ?randomly? to work on new material or play the odd show. </p>
<p>?Tom has been living back in Maitland, where he&#8217;s from &#8211; it&#8217;s near Newcastle &#8211; with his wife Leti [Leticia Nischang], who&#8217;s from Barcelona originally. He lives the quiet life now, and writes some songs every now and then. He&#8217;s written a few new Smudge songs, so we&#8217;re hoping to do a new recording next year.?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s under similarly haphazard circumstances that Smudge found themselves in Europe in May for their first European tour in 16 years &#8211; although calling it a ?tour? is a bit of a misnomer. Galloway was holidaying with her family, so Yee and Morgan decided to join her for a couple shows. ?My family and I went on a three-month trip to Europe recently, so the guys came over and joined us. We did four shows in the UK and three shows in Spain. It was excellent fun.?</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3014727/448x299-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It&#8217;s a fitting modus operandi for a band that came to embody the ?90s slacker aesthetic. Slapped together in 1991 for a Half A Cow compilation called <em>Slice*, Smudge wrote classic pop songs that transcended their couch potato ambitions. Morgan had a way of elevating the everyday into the extraordinary &#8211; whether musing on teen jitters in ?Eighteen In A Week? or writing the best song inspired by a Turkish pizza restaurant *ever</em> (?Divan?). </p>
<p>In the early ?90s he found musical kinship with The Lemonheads? Evan Dando, playing a significant role in their watershed album <em>It&#8217;s A Shame About Ray</em>. For better or worse, the bands have been inseparable ever since. ?We get asked about it [The Lemonheads connection] a lot and it doesn&#8217;t really bother me, I have to say. We don&#8217;t have any gripes about it at all,? says Galloway, who says she&#8217;s still in contact with Dando, albeit sporadically. ?I saw him when he came out last year and I think he and Tom talk all the time.?</p>
<p>In October, Smudge will embark on their first national tour since 1999 in support of their newly released ?best of? <em>This Smudge Is True</em>. Out through Half A Cow &#8211; whose founder Nic Dalton has always been their sort of ?Fifth Beatle? &#8211; it features 27 tracks over an hour, including a trilogy of food-related songs under 30 seconds (?Focaccia?, ?Babaganouj? and ?Steak &amp; Chips?), and classic single ?Don&#8217;t Want To Be Grant McLennan?, which rightly put them on the map.</p>
<blockquote><p>?[Touring] tends to take a bit of the magic out of it: the repetition, the driving, the sitting around. Once you&#8217;re on stage it&#8217;s great, but all that stuff in between is hard work!?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The tour press release opens with the line, ?Smudge never broke up?. Did you ever come close?</strong><br/>
Never. We didn&#8217;t really know what was going to happen when I went overseas [Galloway travelled the world between 1999 and 2002], but we never actually said, ?This is the end.? We&#8217;ve never really had a fight or anything.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s kept you together for so long?</strong><br/>
I think it&#8217;s the fact that there&#8217;s no pressure on us. There&#8217;s no pressure on us from labels or bookers or anything &#8211; We don&#8217;t put pressure on ourselves: we just do things if we&#8217;re all in agreement and we&#8217;re all into it. If one of us is not into it, then we don&#8217;t do it. We know each other very well. I guess we&#8217;re pretty lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Has it always been that like that?</strong><br/>
Oh, definitely. I guess that&#8217;s Tom&#8217;s attitude in general. It worked well with Adam and I because we had our full-time jobs and other things going on in our life. It [Smudge] wasn&#8217;t the be-all and end-all for us. None of us wanted to make a career out of this, or make money out of it. A. That&#8217;s really unrealistic; and B. It was never our agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Was it ever a possibility, I guess, in the mid-1990s?</strong><br/>
I suppose so &#8211; But as much as we love doing what we do, it&#8217;s hardcore. I don&#8217;t know how anyone really does that for their full-time job. The two weeks that we did in Europe touring was really fine, but I was thinking, ?I just don&#8217;t know how people do this for a long time.? It tends to take a bit of the magic out of it: the repetition, the driving, the sitting around. Once you&#8217;re on stage it&#8217;s great, but all that stuff in between is hard work! [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p><strong>Is the magic still there when you get back together and play?</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s always fun. I always stress out, ?Oh, we need heaps of practices before the gig?, but we never really do. We know the songs back-to-front by now. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I think you actually sound better when you&#8217;re sloppier.</strong><br/>
Well, that&#8217;s the other thing too. That&#8217;s always been our shtick. Hey, why change it now? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been particularly active in your 19th year. Why now?</strong><br/>
It just kind of happened that way. Like everything in life, there&#8217;s lulls and peaks. It&#8217;s a natural thing, really.</p>
<p><strong>I ask because there&#8217;s been a real wave of ?90s nostalgia at the moment.</strong><br/>
Yes, isn&#8217;t it good! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think that is? And did it feel like you were part of a golden age of Australian indie guitar pop?</strong><br/>
Look, I&#8217;m still stuck in the ?90s. If you look at my CD collection there&#8217;s not a lot from the past decade. [<em>Laughs</em>] All I can say is that it was some of the best music ever, and I can&#8217;t really step outside and say, ?Is that because it really is? Or was it just my age at that time?? That was my era &#8211; I feel really luck to be part of all that, definitely.</p>
<p><em>There was that whole ?turn up and play? attitude that a lot of bands now could learn from.*</em><br/>
Well, yeah. But that goes in cycles too. That was the punk thing in the ?70s and it kinda got lost again in the ?80s, and then came back in the ?90s. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll come around again.</p>
<p><strong>How much new material is there?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got about three new songs, well I guess they&#8217;re not so new anymore. We&#8217;ll hopefully rustle up a few more, and while we&#8217;re on this trajectory, try and do some recording next year.</p>
<p><strong>For a full-length album?</strong><br/>
Yeah, we may as well. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>What are the songs sounding like?</strong><br/>
They&#8217;re quite different, actually. The three songs are different to each other and two of them, to me, are not your typical Tom Morgan songs &#8211; I can&#8217;t actually describe what they&#8217;re like. They&#8217;re unique. There&#8217;s definitely a change of style there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that has something to do with Tom being involved in other projects [he plays in Bambino Koresh with his wife Leticia]?</strong><br/>
It could be. It could just be old age. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>This is your first national tour since 1999?</strong><br/>
We did play Melbourne a couple years ago, but I wouldn&#8217;t count that as a tour.</p>
<p><strong>Do you recall the last national tour?</strong><br/>
Nah! Sorry. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3014725/640x200-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>I want to move on to the ?best of? [<em>This Smudge Is True</em>]. I love how you&#8217;ve got three songs in there under 30 seconds &#8211; and they&#8217;re all about food.</strong><br/>
We had to put those in! [<em>Laughs</em>] I think it was my idea. It was a big process of picking which songs were going to go in, and then which versions, and trying to remember all the versions, and all the B-sides and all that. Then we had some publishing problems, which held us up for a while. We were supposed to have more songs on there, but due to a certain record company still owning a bunch of our songs and wanting to sell them back to us at a crazy high price, we had to cut a few out?</p>
<p><strong>Who was responsible for the tracklisting?</strong><br/>
We chose all the songs and the running order, and Nic [Dalton, Half A Cow Records] put the package together. We all had to go through and find all our old clippings. Nic had written the Smudge story &#8211; and at the last minute he said, ?I want you guys to do some track-by-track liner notes like The Bee Gees.? So we had emails going all over the place, you know, who&#8217;s going to do what song. We had to do it really quickly to take overseas, so there was this last minute freak-out: ?It&#8217;s due, it&#8217;s due, c&#8217;mon!? And, of course, trying to remember things about the actual recordings &#8211; I was really wracking my brains, but it was heaps of fun in the end. We&#8217;d send them to each other when we&#8217;d finished them and I&#8217;d just laugh at the other guys. It was interesting to see their perspectives; things I&#8217;d forgotten, funny stories I&#8217;d forgotten. I&#8217;m glad he [Nic] made us do it.</p>
<p><strong>So I take it you&#8217;re not the archivist in the band?</strong><br/>
Well, I&#8217;ve kept a lot of stuff, but my memory is shocking. Tom&#8217;s got a fantastic memory, it&#8217;s scary, and Adam&#8217;s is pretty good too. I don&#8217;t know why they make me do the interviews: I can&#8217;t remember anything. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Maybe it&#8217;s because of your media profile?</strong><br/>
I guess I&#8217;m the one that talks the most. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that Tom wrote the liner notes for ?Alison?.</strong><br/>
Well, I was going to do it!</p>
<p><strong>Of the two ?Alison? songs [?Alison? by Smudge and ?Alison&#8217;s Starting To Happen? by The Lemonheads], which one&#8217;s your favourite?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t consider either of them as being about me, they just happen to have my name. They&#8217;re both fantastic, what can I say? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
