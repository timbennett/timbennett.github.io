                <h3>Back home in Melbourne, <strong>PIKELET</strong> (aka Evelyn Morris) reflects on a grueling four months overseas in this, the final installment of her four-part tour diary.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006631/440x523-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Time to wrap this tour up. I&#8217;ve been back in Melbourne now for more than two weeks, and it&#8217;s hanging over my head that I haven&#8217;t even begun to tell you about Europe. First though I&#8217;ll finish the States.</p>
<h2>Portland</h2>
<p>Played a show at a small DIY space called The Wail with Grouper and Josh Armistead. Josh just happened to be over here in America at the same time as me so I was lucky enough to play a show with two of my favourite musicians. Both Grouper and Josh played mesmerising sets.  The following day I traveled to Annacortes to play a show at The Department of Safety (DOS). It&#8217;s a great all-ages space that used to be a fire station.</p>
<p>At the DOS show I was joined by Gus Franklin, who was doing a performance of the music he wrote while in residency at the DOS last summer. Seeing as it was the fourth of July there were fireworks and some light-cone activities outside the venue.</p>
<p>I returned to Portland the next day.  Played a venue called Valentines, in the heart of Portland city. Once again I&#8217;m joined by Josh Armistead, along with Katy Davidson (Dear Nora) and Carcrashlander. I was so pleased with the show all-round, and had a great time playing as well.<br/>
After the Valentines show I finally had a few days off to rest and re-coup after the extensive and exhausting American tour. It was so nice to spend a few days in Portland riding a bike around and socialising with lovely people I met there.</p>
<p>#New York City</p>
<p>At New Jersey airport I was met by my good friend Jeffrey Lewis, who showed me to the bus that took us all the way to his house in Brooklyn.  We spent a couple of days wandering around, and he showed me some of his favourite spots.</p>
<p>I played three more shows in New York. The first at ?Huggabroomstock?, which was held at a venue called Goodbye Blue Monday. I was playing there alongside about 20 other bands as part of this little mini- festival organised by some of Jeffrey&#8217;s friends. I guess people call it the ?anti-folk scene?. Two of my favourite acts at this event were Peter Dizozza and Purple Organ. The following night I played at a venue called Bruar Falls, which is a new(ish) venue in Brooklyn run by the some people that run The Cake Shop in Manhattan. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006632/440x483-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I was particularly excited about this show, as I had managed to land a show with one of my favourite bedroom artists R. Stevie Moore. I had stars in my eyes. If you haven&#8217;t heard any R.Stevie Moore, well, I&#8217;m sorry to say you have a massive journey ahead of you. Even the most dedicated fans probably don&#8217;t own everything he&#8217;s ever made, and he&#8217;s making new stuff every day. Nevertheless, check this <a href="http://www.wtv-zone.com/rsmko/">link</a> and start the magical journey if you dare. I also wrote and recorded a song while in Manhattan. There was a sweet old Wurlitzer at Jeff&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house and I couldn&#8217;t resist. </p>
<h2>Portugal </h2>
<p>Portugal is where I met up with Joseph Foley aka Extreme Wheeze. I was so very glad to see him. We met in Lisbon and spent some time catching up and enjoying Portugal before playing our first show together at a venue called Maximes, which was an old strip club. It was very lavish, with lots of red velvet everywhere. I managed to explode my mixing desk at this show which put me in a little bit of financial stress. Live and learn, I guess.</p>
<p>We then had the delightful pleasure of playing with Jens Lekman in Coimbra and Porto. These shows were organised by some friends in a collective called Lugar Comum. They did such an amazing job and the shows were a blast. We all had a great time, making lots of new friends, eating the most delicious food, and even having a drunken sing-along after the last show.</p>

<h2>France/Spain</h2>
<p>Joe and I navigated our way on the train from Porto to Paris and then Paris to Tours. There we met Jeffrey Lewis, who arrived quite late due to some serious trouble with a hired van, resulting in hitchhiking and all sorts of ridiculousness. After the show in Tours everyone stayed up late at a house we stayed at in the country, with Joe playing ukulele around a bonfire until 5am.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006634/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We then drove to Dijon after stopping in at the local radio station in Tours. In Dijon we met with Jeffrey&#8217;s bass player brother Jack and his drummer Dave Beauchamp. Over the following two weeks we played in Dijon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Barcelona (two shows in one night), Clermont-Ferrand and Lille. We also stayed in Hyeres in the southeast of France for a festival called Mono, which Jeffrey and co played. While there we had a lovely time meeting lots of other bands and going swimming at the beaches. The bands that caught my attention the most there were The Wave Pictures and Mahjongg. We also ran into New Zealand sweethearts The Little Pictures.</p>
<p>The whole tour of France with Jeff et al was hilarious fun. We had obligatory gigantic-sized van issues and excellent food.  Joe and I also played in Saintes and Saint Etienne once the rest of the crew had left. Some notable experiences were a hippy festival near Saintes, spending time with the delightful Ladybird dudes and some peddle-boat rides on a beautiful body of water in Sainte Etienne.   </p>

<h2>Germany</h2>
<p>Joe and I only played two shows in Berlin while in Germany. We were there for three days, with Joe&#8217;s birthday nicely sandwiched on the second day, meaning that we enjoyed a whole three days of the best party-fun that Berlin had to offer. Not much sleep was had. We were taken care of by friends old and new, and overdid it in the most spectacular fashion. Both shows were well attended and excellent energy-wise. There is so much more I&#8217;d love to say about our stay in Berlin but I am trying to conserve words.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3006636/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<h2>Ireland</h2>
<p>We had a one-night-only rock&#8217;n?roll style stop in Dublin, with the delightful folk from Crayonsmith as our gracious hosts. Joe and I arrived there in a not-so terrific state. This, however, did not deter us from our attempts to drink Guinness the way it&#8217;s meant to be drunk &#8211; in large volumes. However, I must admit that after Joe had managed to down six pints of the black liquid there were some serious after-effects the next day that made traveling on a plane with him to Sweden somewhat less enjoyable. He is only human after all. Sometimes I forget that what with all the amazing super-human qualities he exudes.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3006637/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<h2>Sweden</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006638/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Met with Sarah Blasko in Stockholm at a venue called Landet. Had some trouble getting bags from the plane, however, we managed to borrow gear from all the other bands, and the show went really well. Sarah&#8217;s set was excellent; a stripped-back kinda jazz band feel. A day later we played an entirely acoustic show at a bookstore called Izzy&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzy_Young">Folklore Centrum</a>. Both Sarah and I were extremely nervous at this show, as it was such an intimate and quiet setting, with an incredible history to live up to.</p>
<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
<p>London is unfortunately the final stop for Joe. We play one last show together at The Windmill and say a teary goodbye the following morning.  It was such an honour to have him on tour with me. I couldn&#8217;t even imagine continuing on without him &#8211; cheering me up and charming everyone we met. What a guy. I spent a day feeling miserable and lonely, and then pulled myself back together again, remembering all the splendid things we had shared in the last four weeks. I have about five days off in London after one more show on my own, at a venue called The Good Ship. I spent time in London catching up with the folks from Batrider, drinking yummy coffees (all made by ex-pat Aussies and New Zealanders it seemed) and generally relaxing. </p>

<img class="c" data-src="/images/3006640/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/></p>
<h2>Estonia</h2>
<p>Flew in to Tallinn and was met by my favourite Estonian Tauno. There were two shows in Estonia. The first in Tartu, at a caf?/venue that felt like an old-school gym; and back in Tallinn at an arts space called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture<em>Factory</em>Polymer">Polymer</a>, where I also wound up staying for a few days.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006641/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Polymer was a doll-making factory back in Soviet times. It&#8217;s now been an arts space for several years. The complex is gigantic, with all kinds of artists staying and working there. There is a giant sauna built in one of the galleries as part of an exhibition and a piano with only one key. On the final evening of the Global Container Festival there were naked men wearing gimp masks walking around and a three-level seesaw. It was quite a bizarre mind-boggling place.</p>
<h2>Latvia</h2>
<p>I did a quick little one-night-only stop in Riga in the middle of my Estonia stay. There was a bus ride, a show, a night at a hostel, an interview with the local community radio station and then a bus ride back to Tallinn. It was literally that simple. Got hustled by a taxi driver, but I didn&#8217;t mind too much. The show was definitely worth it.</p>

<h2>Finland</h2>
<p>From Tallinn I got on a ferry to Helsinki. Mikko, who organised the shows and is an old friend, met me there. He drove me to Tampere where I played a show with three hardcore bands. One of the bands, Can Can Heads, impressed me a great deal with their original take on post-hardcore. I was a little scared that people wouldn&#8217;t get into my set at all, as everyone was seriously decked out in crust-punk and old-school punk gear. Played anyway, and ended up having one of the most enjoyable sets of the tour, selling all my CDs and a good chunk of merch. Mikko explained to me that as Tampere has quite a small population it&#8217;s very common for all kinds of bands to get thrown together on the same bill, and as a consequence people are very open to hearing all kinds of music. This warmed my heart somewhat and made me think of Melbourne. I was getting pretty anxious for home by this stage. </p>
<p>One final show in Helsinki, with an amazing surf/exotica/experimental band, a singer-songwriter who sang in Finnish, and an experimental performer who had some kind of crocheted synthesizer that involved putting strings of beads into glasses of water. </p>
<p>What a delightful ending.</p>
<p>I flew home via LA and San Francisco if you can believe it. End of tour party in San Francisco with some new friends left me slightly rattled and confused. (In a good way.) It might have been the partying, but it also may have been more to do with the completion of a long and epic journey filled with emotional ups and downs, lessons learned, friends made, trains/planes/buses and ferries caught/missed, money made, mistakes made, money spent and, of course, some music now and then.</p>
