Since forming in Sydney in 1987, The Necks have refined their slow-burning improvisational explorations across some 16 albums, with last year&#8217;s <em><a href="/releases/2000987">Mindset</a></em> their most recent. Band members Chris Abrahams (piano, keyboards), Tony Buck (drums, percussion) and Lloyd Swanton (bass) meet for just a few weeks each year and are currently touring across Australia.</p>
<p>Borne from silence, The Necks? music invites the listener into a sparse landscape that may appear stark or austere, until fertile patterns of melodic or rhythmic development begin to slowly unfurl in time, like creepers or vines. </p>
<p><strong>What are your strongest memories of the earliest days of The Necks?</strong><br/>
Probably all of the workshopping that we did at Sydney University&#8217;s music department. We would often play with the lights off, in a pitch-dark rehearsal room. Playing that way was a pretty intense way to kick things off. Then we would lie around on the benches afterwards, talking about how the music was working out or what it needed. Anyone walking in on us during that process probably thought it looked a little weird. </p>
<p>We did months of that, six months I think. The band was only going to be a laboratory experiment, not even a recording entity, so it felt appropriate to talk about what it was we were doing. It gave it shape. Soon it felt that we were generating the kind of music we&#8217;d hoped for and that matched our intentions.</p>
<p><strong>What were those intentions and how have they changed over the years?</strong><br/>
The main objective was purely musical: creating music more spontaneously and more creatively than we&#8217;d sometimes felt in other projects, with only a few ground rules. The other objective was that this was never going to be a public performing band. Over time our feelings changed and we did start playing live but our objectives for public performance were completely different to what we wanted from the studio. </p>
<p>Originally our thoughts were that our live shows would never be recorded and that they should just disappear into the ether. There was much discussion about this. We had concerns that releasing live records would generate expectations in peoples? minds, that this is what The Necks? live experience is always like. We didn&#8217;t want to quash our ability to experiment and take things in a different direction every time we get onstage. Realistically that objective &#8211; impermanence &#8211; was possible back then but nowadays it wouldn&#8217;t be, as someone in the audience would just record it and put it out on the net. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>The three of you only get together for brief periods each year. Do you trade ideas before you meet up or do you save them up until you&#8217;re actually in a room together?</strong><br/>
Mostly the latter. We like to wait and see what happens when we&#8217;re all together. There have been times that we&#8217;ve booked a recording studio with the intent of doing an album and we&#8217;ve discussed our intentions by email in the weeks and months leading up to it. Way back in our earliest years, we would sometimes spend a few hours rehearsing ideas before recording. Actually for <em>Mindset</em> we revisited that approach, though I&#8217;m not sure if it counts really as it was so brief; just half an hour at a soundcheck.</p>
<p>Getting The Necks together for only a few weeks each year keeps things fresh, it&#8217;s always a happy reunion and we&#8217;re never sick of each other. But in saying that, we&#8217;re ever so gradually pushing the boundaries of how much of each other we can stand. [<em>Laughs</em>] We recently did a tour of Europe that was 19 shows, with 17 on consecutive nights. We survived that and are still talking to each other because everyone&#8217;s learned to pull their heads in and just get the job done. Perhaps that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, given B.B. King used to average 320 shows a year &#8211; well, that would test The Necks. Also creatively, for us it would get a bit stale. We need to go away and regenerate.</p>
<p><strong>What new things come out of repeatedly playing live together over a short duration?</strong><br/>
Themes emerge from night to night and, without us even having to talk about it, we recognise the elements that might make up our next new work, they suggest themselves. That can be a real surprise for us as much as anyone else. Like with the shows we just did in Canberra at The Street Theatre, in the second set on Sunday night we started playing with genre, slipping from jazz into electric rock but with a mid-tempo bossa groove. While it was a little bit retro it went to some pretty weird places and was really nice to explore. God knows where that came from; maybe that&#8217;s Canberra. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>The Necks still start every live show with a few minutes of silence, right?</strong><br/>
Yep. Crowd willing. </p>
<p><strong>Is that important for the band to get into a particular mind state, or is it to make the crowd more receptive?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s just to get the whole room on the same page. I&#8217;m surprised more musicians don&#8217;t do the same; I think it&#8217;s a logical, normal way to start a gig. Just stand there, wait for everyone to get quiet, and once you&#8217;ve achieved that silence &#8211; which after all is what everything is going to build from &#8211; then any idea you have is going to have this incredible framework of silence around it, which will give it so much more dignity and impact. </p>
<p><strong>You never know which of you is going to start playing first, do you?</strong><br/>
No, we never discuss it. Occasionally patterns emerge; after one person has been tending to start more often then someone might jump in as if to say, ?Nah, it&#8217;s my turn guys.? [<em>Laughs</em>] But I wouldn&#8217;t want to label it or for you to think that it&#8217;s tit for tat or anything. We generally don&#8217;t even notice. Because the beginning is anyone&#8217;s, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Given the unplanned nature, has the start of a show ever gone horribly wrong?</strong><br/>
Well, there was one show in Belgium where Chris and I literally came in at the very same moment. I had my eyes closed and he had his back to me so there was no way we could have known. Miraculously, we were in much the same key and it sounded fine so hey, fantastic, it had to be. Then just the other night, again in Canberra, I had picked up the bow and was just starting to play but Chris came in right at the same time. What I was going to play didn&#8217;t work with what he was doing so I put the bow away and had to rethink.</p>
<p>But one of the really important lessons we&#8217;ve learned is not to panic. The Necks are a band that has a reputation for making music that may take 45 minutes or an hour to evolve, but occasionally we still need to remind ourselves that there&#8217;s plenty of time to make it go where we want. Sometimes in the early days we got ourselves in a terrible tangle because we slipped into playing at cross-purposes, and then we found ourselves going into so-called damage control. If there&#8217;s one lesson I&#8217;ve learnt from my time in The Necks, which can be applied to all music making, it&#8217;s ?don&#8217;t panic?, stick with what you&#8217;re doing. It might cause the odd raised eyebrow for a minute or two, but sooner or later it is going to click and someone&#8217;s going to play something full of ideas that open it all up and then it&#8217;ll be, ?BANG! Here we go?. </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ll play something that either explains what&#8217;s just happened or will take it somewhere else?</strong><br/>
Yeah, that&#8217;s it, whereas if all three of us play like we are scrabbling for a solution, well, what exactly are we making a solution for? If all of us change what we were doing, then what Chris was doing is no longer relevant to what Tony was doing and so on, we&#8217;ll never find it. It&#8217;s better to just stick to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Also I find as a creative artist I get some good ideas but realistically I don&#8217;t get loads and loads of them. [<em>Laughs</em>] I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s OK not to have great new ideas all of the time, but if I just keep going with what I have then that will be sufficient for a spell, until the moment when I finally do have a grand idea and can drop it in. But if I don&#8217;t, then that&#8217;s still OK; it&#8217;s not like I have to shut up, instead I just have to fulfill my role, and that in itself will allow one of the others to take the music where it needs to go. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s move from live performance back to The Necks? recording process now. Can you describe the differences in approach?</strong><br/>
When The Necks record we&#8217;re taking our live approach to time and creation and going back over it, layering and layering, over a period of a week or more. Then we&#8217;re looking at that big slab of music we&#8217;ve created and, in the mixing process, deleting much of it, peeling it down to some very basic textures. By this point it&#8217;s apparent what the shape of the overall piece is. By doing almost everything in real time and using very little sequencing it gives us the opportunity to really get acquainted with what it is we&#8217;ve got. If everything was made up of short edits and we were like, ?Just program this bit in and that bit in and we&#8217;ll do a final run of it all at the end of the session?, then that wouldn&#8217;t work for us. We wouldn&#8217;t know what it is we had got. </p>
<p><strong>So that&#8217;s a very different way of recording improvised music and assembling it into a whole than, say, Teo Macero&#8217;s work with Miles Davis?</strong><br/>
Yes, well Macero and Davis used a lot of sequential splicing, with a lot of edits from different takes, which was a great way to work for them. While [The Necks] tend to lay down a bed track of some sort and then layer sounds over it, after we&#8217;ve already established the length of the piece, that it&#8217;s an hour long or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the albums in your discography that don&#8217;t fit that model. What prompts the band to move away from hour-long mood pieces to albums with lots of shorter tracks, like <em>Next* [1990] or *The Boys* [1998] or ones that drop the listener straight in, like *Chemist* [2004] or *Mindset</em> rather than evolving slowly?</strong><br/>
Taking it on a case-by-case basis, it&#8217;s funny because after having released our debut LP, <em>Sex* [1989], our main objective for *Next* was to not become stereotyped as ?the-band-that-does-hour-long songs?. So we did six shorter pieces that time; then went straight back to hour-long pieces again. [*Laughs*] Well, that&#8217;s debatable actually, as our next album after that, *Aquatic</em> [1994], featured two separate but complementary pieces smashed together, which followed the Teo Macero approach really.</p>
<p>Having lots of different tracks on <em>The Boys* was just the practical consequences of working on music for a film soundtrack. I don&#8217;t think we gave the film crew any song or texture that was longer than 10 minutes, because they generally weren&#8217;t going to need anything longer than a few seconds. So we played just long enough to lay down music that went into some interesting areas that then offered different possibilities to the filmmakers. With *Chemist*, I think doing three 20 tracks just amused us. Can it still feel like The Necks and not feel rushed? While with *Mindset</em> we quite specifically decided to do an LP record, so wanted two sidelong tracks, which is why the CD is exactly the same and doesn&#8217;t have any extra tracks or whatever even though the album is short by The Necks? standards. In a way you could say we have just released a new LP, which is also available on CD. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a quote from Chris that I wanted to talk with you about: ?The Necks? studio albums generally have an overarching concept that is decided before we begin?.</strong><br/>
I can agree with that in terms of whatever we&#8217;re working on, we&#8217;d be looking at what our output had been thus far, as we tend not to do two very similar recordings in a row. Our albums tend to be a reaction against what the previous one or two were.</p>
<p><strong>So with a record like <em>Silent Night</em> [1996] and the track ?Black?, for instance, which was heavily dependent on sampling, then you wouldn&#8217;t use samples on the next album?</strong><br/>
Right. If you look at <em>Hanging Gardens* [1999], followed by *Aether* [2001], followed by *Drive By* [2003] they&#8217;re all very different records. Some people think *Drive By* is very similar to *Sex</em>, which I personally don&#8217;t hear but a lot of people say that to me, so that&#8217;s our eighth studio album connecting back to the approach of our first. </p>
<p><strong>What do you think the records reveal about the specific circumstances of their creation?</strong><br/>
The Necks? recordings are very much focused on questions of sound and perception and the passing of time &#8211; what you might call psycho-acoustic experiences, where you&#8217;re hearing things that aren&#8217;t necessarily the sounds that are actually being made. How sounds collide and create the illusion of other sounds, we&#8217;re into that sort of thing. So the records reveal whatever combinations of elements tend to be fascinating us at the time. That might come from what we are listening to, sometimes from the other people that we&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>However we&#8217;re not real big on emotion in music. Some might fall to the floor in shock at that revelation, because for many people music and emotion are synonymous. In a lot of music that is the case but our music is very free of sentiment and not dependent on our personal lives. People might say you can&#8217;t have anything bigger than human emotion; well, there is the universe [<em>laughs</em>]. Without wanting to sound like a hippy, there is that line [by William Blake] that you can find eternity in a grain of sand. We&#8217;ve all had that experience, of focusing on something really small that is giving us an insight into something enormous, namely the universe or infinity. The fundamentals of physics as applied to music are endlessly inspiring and I don&#8217;t think any musician who is swept up by that can be accused of being unemotional. </p>
<p><strong>Have you noticed any geographical particularities in how The Necks? music is received? Do different countries respond in different ways?</strong><br/>
Not really; just little things like in America people always want to talk to me about the cut-down double bass I use, while in other countries that doesn&#8217;t happen. Our audiences in Australia are much more spread across every demographic, but I think that&#8217;s partly because we&#8217;re so much more established here and have grown up with the audience, so we&#8217;re literally seeing the children of those who listened to us twenty five years ago coming along to the concerts now. People who were conceived to our first album come up and tell us that. </p>
<blockquote><p>?We would often play with the lights off, in a pitch-dark rehearsal room.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Given the title and duration of your debut, that must happen a fair bit?</strong><br/>
Oh yeah, all sorts of people tell us that. <em>Sex* must be the most useful record I&#8217;ve ever played on. But not just for the obvious, as every one of the life stages seems to be represented, whether it&#8217;s people who work at birthing clinics who use it to soundtrack what they do or someone telling me they played it at their dad&#8217;s funeral, which is all lovely to hear. *Sex</em> is also one of the few of my own records to serve a really useful purpose personally, domestically, as we noticed it worked as a lullaby to send our own child to sleep. To the point where I can&#8217;t really listen to it anymore, I&#8217;ve heard it too much.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re talking about the utility of music now, which is something that Brian Eno has written and spoken of in detail. The Necks have worked with Eno a few times [in Sydney and Brighton]. How was that and how does your work compare and contrast with what he does?</strong><br/>
I had never really listened to Eno&#8217;s albums when I was younger but I was very aware of what he was about. I will state categorically that The Necks wouldn&#8217;t have made the decision to start making the sort of music we do if Brian Eno hadn&#8217;t been following his own investigations in music 10 or 20 years beforehand, because his work affected the whole musical environment. While I think The Necks are doing something quite different to what he does, he set the stage that we, and others, play on. </p>
<p>There hasn&#8217;t been a whole lot of ongoing dialogue with him or anything &#8211; Brian is a very busy man [<em>laughs*] &#8211; but extremely approachable in the context of a specific project, he&#8217;s totally into it and there&#8217;s absolutely no hierarchy, he&#8217;s incredibly down to earth. I believe his father was a postman and I wonder if that has a lot more to do with who he is and what he does with music than a lot of other things people write and talk about [*laughs</em>] </p>
<p>For me, it was exciting to play with Eno because of his consummate professionalism and the way he related to people on a personal level, rather than having any great revelations about music that I&#8217;d never thought of before. He&#8217;s renowned as a collaborator because he knows how to bring out the best in the people that he works with.</p>
<p><strong>Now we spoke briefly about the band&#8217;s soundtrack to <em>The Boys</em> before. Given that was 15 years ago and you haven&#8217;t done one since, are you no longer interested in creating music for film?</strong><br/>
We haven&#8217;t chased doing more soundtracks and nothing has really come to us, though we will consider any new project on its own merits. I don&#8217;t actually think that The Necks? music is an automatic fit for most cinema or television. I guess it depends on what aspect of The Necks we&#8217;re talking about; because the band that gets up onstage and does a one-hour improvisation isn&#8217;t really going to fit with contemporary soundtrack requirements. Getting back to what we were talking about music and emotion &#8211; and its cousin, drama &#8211; what we&#8217;re about is not necessarily sufficiently dramatic in order to aurally sum up plot points that turn on a pin. </p>

<p/>
<p>But the three of us aren&#8217;t always in The Necks of course, so Chris and I have done some other TV soundtrack work separately. The first project, <em>A Case for the Coroner* for ABC TV about 10 years ago, was a raging success; it was fantastic. Chris and I tried to create something that was completely commercial and mainstream but the producers thought that what we came up with was radical and different, while we thought we&#8217;d come up with something populist enough to be used for the Channel 7 News theme. [*Laughs</em>] On the strength of that we ended up getting another job with Channel 9 and that didn&#8217;t work, it was just the wrong choice for all concerned. They shouldn&#8217;t have chosen us and we shouldn&#8217;t have said yes.</p>
<p>Rowan Woods, who directed <em>The Boys*, approached us to do music for his next film after that, *Little Fish</em>, and that would have been great. After seeing the film I must admit to wondering what we could have done with that, but we simply couldn&#8217;t make our schedules fit together. </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next for The Necks now?</strong><br/>
The shows in Australia have been going really well, with more to come, and we&#8217;ll then take a break before going back into the studio to mix one or more live albums, which will be our next release or releases. Possibly as a digital download only, possibly as a box set or a double album &#8211; we don&#8217;t know yet, rather than make that decision now we&#8217;ll wait and see what we think of the live tapes we go through.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;ll all become clearer in time?</strong><br/>
Exactly. </p>
