                <h3>Emboldened by a new incarnation and an upcoming box set, ?80s pop heroes Models have begun writing and recording new material. Sean Kelly opens up about the band&#8217;s storied past, present and future to <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3037936/440x320-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
When Models extended their initial 1978-1988 lifespan with another new incarnation in <a href="/news/4602622">mid-2013</a>, the most pressing question was which era of the band would be best represented. The prickly quirk-pop and New Wave jitters of 1980?s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf">mouthful of a debut</a> and 1981?s <em>Local and/or General*? The James Freud-influenced brooding of 1983?s *The Pleasure of Your Company* and 1985?s mainstream breakthrough *Out of Mind, Out of Sight*? The more overtly commercial direction of 1986?s swan song *Models? Media</em>?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the current lineup &#8211; Sean Kelly, Andrew Duffield, Barton Price and Mark Ferrie &#8211; cuts across various eras of the band. Ferrie and Duffield were both members from 1979 to 1982, while Duffield did an extra two years and Price spanned 1982 to 1988. Kelly remains the constant, and to his ear this configuration most strongly evokes the band&#8217;s middle albums, which are being prepped for an upcoming box set that might grow to include all five full-lengths.</p>
<p>Not solely in archival mode, they&#8217;re finishing up an EP of new material too. ?It sounds like a mature version of our [middle] period,? Kelly confirms, later adding, ?It remind[s] me of our early-?80s period, but with our late-?80s big beat.?</p>
<p>From their early cult presence around Melbourne to their smash national hits in 1983 &#8211; they hit #1 and #2, respectively, for Freud&#8217;s ?Out of Mind, Out of Sight? and the Freud/Duffield co-write ?Barbados? &#8211; Models remain an integral part of Australia&#8217;s 1980s canon. And better yet, for that decade, they&#8217;ve emerged as something to be admired rather than be embarrassed by. They were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2010, just days before the <a href="/news/4110489">sudden death</a> of James Freud, and have since seen <em>Out of Mind, Out of Sight</em> reissued and met with renewed respect for its eerie dark/light duality.</p>
<p>Ahead of the box set and with more gigs on the immediate horizon, Kelly spoke at length to <em>M+N</em> about the vagaries of Models, over the years and today.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose the middle three albums for the <em>Magnetic</em> box set?</strong><br/>
I think we decided it was the most representative &#8211; not the most representative, but &#8211; gee, that&#8217;s a bloody tough question. It&#8217;s because we have this lineup that&#8217;s a hybrid of an early lineup and a later lineup. If anything, the extent version of the band is more representative of that middle period.</p>
<p>But I should inform you that Warner Brothers &#8211; who are now the record company for Models; Mushroom on-sold the catalogue whenever it was &#8211; are seriously considering putting [all] five albums in the box now. It&#8217;s been really encouraging that they&#8217;re prepared to assist us with repackaging everything and getting the product out there again. I&#8217;m still not sure if it was our fault that we missed the [previous] deadline for the three-album box or whether something happened at their end, but I suspect it was the former.</p>
<blockquote><p>?There&#8217;s definitely a CD of so-called ?rarities?. We&#8217;ve got our original demo of ?Barbados?.?</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve actually been, apart from all being involved in other projects, focusing on producing and working on our new stuff for the last month. And, indeed, trying to streamline our live sort of thing. Gosh, that&#8217;s a really bad way of putting it. So we haven&#8217;t actually had a lot of contact with them over the last month or so, but the plan was to reschedule it for early in the new year. Initially it was really quite disappointing that the box set wasn&#8217;t going to come out mid-December, but eventually the penny dropped with me that in fact we&#8217;re possibly only talking about a delay of a month or two. But as I&#8217;ve said, we&#8217;ve entered into a dialogue about perhaps making it a more expansive edition.</p>
<p>At this stage, we&#8217;re still planning on calling the collection <em>Magnetic* and we&#8217;ll probably go with the artwork we almost completed. We just need to expand it a bit. We might even squeeze <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_Lunch">1981?s] *[Cut Lunch</a></em> EP in there as well.</p>
<p><strong>Will the box set collect B-sides, demos, outtakes and all that ephemera too?</strong><br/>
Well, there&#8217;s definitely a CD of so-called ?rarities? to be included. We pretty much compiled that [already] &#8211; gosh, I wish I had the list somewhere. It&#8217;s basically alternative takes of songs. For example, we re-recorded ?Two Cabs to the Toucan? when we went over to London to record [1981?s] <em>Local and/or General*. So we&#8217;ve got an alternative &#8211; in my opinion, pretty good &#8211; rendition from virtually the same period as the original. I in particular am glad that one&#8217;s being included, because I&#8217;ve always thought our *Cut Lunch</em> rendition of ?Two Cabs? sounded a bit bizarre. So it&#8217;s good to have an alternative version. It&#8217;s similar but perhaps a little more cohesive from go to woe. We&#8217;ve got our original demo of ?Barbados??</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U5SXucIJhFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>That&#8217;d be really interesting to hear.</strong><br/>
Well, yeah, it&#8217;s got a slightly different chorus and all these extra backing vocals. I had to check with James? family to make sure they didn&#8217;t have a problem with us using it and seeing if they thought James [would have] thought it was a good idea. Because basically it&#8217;s a prototype, almost, of the song. For example, the verse lyrics are different. So I think that&#8217;s interesting. But you hear it and it&#8217;s obviously the same song.</p>
<p><strong>I interviewed Mark Opitz <a href="/icons/4367877">a while back</a>. We talked about him working with Models and specifically about ?Barbados?.</strong><br/>
Yeah, well, before Mark was involved with ?Barbados? we had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Lucas">Reggie Lucas</a>, the producer from New Jersey who worked on it with us. We didn&#8217;t like a lot of what he did and we ended up finishing it off with Mark&#8217;s assistance. But, in fact, the version that&#8217;s due to appear on the bonus disc is a completely different rendition.</p>
<p>They say with artistic endeavours that quite often your first idea is the best. I know when I&#8217;m in the writing process, it&#8217;s always a good rule of thumb &#8211; y&#8217;know, if you end up labouring over the creation of some work, it&#8217;s always helpful at some point to remind oneself of what one actually intended in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s an absolute, but it certainly works a lot for me.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wB5Ae8Iiims" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>I have a 12? of ?Barbados? with the extended dance version. It&#8217;s got some other cool songs on it, like covers of ?Blue Moon? and ?Steam Roller Blues?. Are those going to be in the box set?</strong><br/>
They were certainly on the list, and we haven&#8217;t really finalised it yet. We were very close; we missed our deadline by a hair. We did have a list of about 11 or 12 songs, and ?Blue Moon? and ?Steam Roller Blues? were certainly considered. But I think I might have put the kibosh on those, for pretty banal reasons. ?Blue Moon?, it&#8217;s just we haven&#8217;t even tried to play that one in 20 years or something. It was always a bit of a throwaway.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like a lark &#8211; something you just did on the side for fun.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Certainly there&#8217;s interest in it?</p>
<p><strong>I couldn&#8217;t find it online, on YouTube or anything.</strong><br/>
I used to own a cassette called <em>Elvis Blue*. It was a compilation of Elvis Presley singing songs that had ?blue? in the title. Yes, they were able to compile a whole album. [*Laughs</em>] That&#8217;s where both of those songs came from. We were playing ?Steam Roller Blues? &#8211; it was almost a staple of our set in the early ?80s. I didn&#8217;t even know it was a James Taylor song; I just thought it was this cool Elvis song. It&#8217;s got the bongos and he does this little falsetto improvisation.</p>
<p>So yeah, I was pretty amazed when I discovered that Elvis was in fact doing a James Taylor song. But then, I have to admit I didn&#8217;t know half as much about Elvis then as I do now. And, of course, we know that he would just about cover anything, from Tony Joe White to Barry Gibb. </p>

<p><strong>You guys have been on hiatus for a while. What was everyone doing in those intervening years?</strong><br/>
Well, of course, Mark Ferrie has been ensconced in <em>RocKwiz* in the band for 10 years or something. Andrew Duffield&#8217;s been studying and teaching music and piano and, indeed, electronic music. I&#8217;ve been involved in various other bands and solo projects plus honing my skills as a storeman and forklift driver. I&#8217;m happy to have that behind me. Does anybody like getting up at 6:30 and having to dispatch goods in a freezing warehouse? [*Laughs</em>] Barton Price has been living in New Zealand and raising a family. That&#8217;s probably it, in a nutshell.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Absent Friends did a tour of Europe with INXS. We did a couple of Wembley Stadiums. They were kind of peaking.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the status of the solo stuff you did?</strong><br/>
Well, the closest I came to a release from my sojourns into the world of solo stuff was probably in 2006 &#8211; I was one of the artists who did an acoustic album <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Sean-Kelly-Moons-Of-Jupiter/release/3294324"><em>[Moons of Jupiter</a>*] for the Liberation Blue series. Also, I was living in Sydney for 10 years and I had a band up there called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Dukes</em>(Australian_band">The Dukes</a>). Geoffrey Stapleton from GANGgajang was my main cowriter in that band, but we had a full-time horn section too. We were involved in a few film soundtracks [including 1993?s *Reckless Kelly</em>] and toured a bit.</p>
<p>There was of course the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absent<em>Friends</em>(band">Absent Friends</a>) thing: after the <em>Models? Media</em> album [in 1986], I actually started a band with Wendy Matthews, who&#8217;d been doing backups with Models. We ended up touring Europe with that band. We did a tour of Europe guesting with INXS that lasted a couple months. We did a couple of Wembley Stadiums with them. They were kind of peaking, I think. That was interesting.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/y1G3qlSIotw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Did Models have much success overseas? I know you had the international deal with A&amp;M?</strong><br/>
Well, the A&amp;M thing was pretty much at the start of our recording adventure. After our <em>Cut Lunch* EP, we ended up touring Australia as guests of The Police. They had some of their record company around and so we actually, yes, signed to A&amp;M. It&#8217;s fair to say we didn&#8217;t make a great impression in London and Europe, although we did get some memorable reviews for some of our work. [*Laughs*] But then much later, around the time we had our *Out of Mind, Out of Sight</em> album [in 1985], we actually got signed to Geffen Records in Los Angeles. So we toured the States a bit. We travelled around America as the support act for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD).</p>
<blockquote><p>?We were lampooned for daring to put out such a commercial-sounding release.?</p></blockquote>
<p>When <em>Out of Mind, Out of Sight* came out, we also did our own little tour that basically took in a pretty broad range of cities around the States. All the major places. Our single ?Out of Mind, Out of Sight? went to #36 on the Billboard 100, so we did make a bit of an impression. The interesting thing about the *Out of Mind, Out of Sight</em> release in America is that it was actually available as an import on a lot of campus radios. It was picked up almost as an indie import and played, which has got to be the most amazing irony because, y&#8217;know, back here in Australia when we put that album out, we were really lampooned in some ways for daring to put out such a commercial-sounding release. It was a big hit here, which was nice, but, geez, it&#8217;s hard to forget when you have the media and all sorts of critics putting the boots into you.</p>
<p>So it was ironic that, elsewhere in the world, it was perceived as being quite arty and alternative.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L7dnvxvcGRc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the interesting thing about the band: revisiting the albums, they do get more commercial as they progress, but there&#8217;s such a quirkiness in all of it. Especially in the beginning, like the first couple records, it&#8217;s really strange stuff. But still poppy and New Wave-y?</strong><br/>
Well, if you listen to our first album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf">1980?s <em>[Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf</a>*], which is something I haven&#8217;t done for a very long time <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Models/album/Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf/track/Two<em>People</em>Per<em>Sq.</em>Km./">*Laughs</em>], there&#8217;s a track called [?Two People Per km??</a>. We probably should have called that song ?Dancing Makes Me Seasick?, which was in fact the chorus lyrics. I would suggest that it&#8217;s possibly the most bubblegum, poppy thing we ever recorded, and that was on our first album.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve just had this &#8211; well, I was going to say we&#8217;ve always been described as too poppy and, I don&#8217;t know, a sell-out or something, so it was amusing when James joined the band. I think he, to a certain extent, was able to distil the sound of the band with his writing. People acted as if we&#8217;d never attempted to play any pop music in our lives, which was amazing. And things haven&#8217;t really changed. I really love improvisation and I&#8217;m quite into alternative music myself, but I tend to write poppy stuff to go with the darker sort of material &#8211; and always have. It may be my influence, in fact, that has made the band such a &#8211; oh, what&#8217;s the word? &#8211; such a <em>contradiction</em>. There&#8217;s something anomalous about us.</p>
<p><strong>Did you write that song ?God Bless America? from <em>The Pleasure of Your Company</em>?</strong><br/>
Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I managed to come up with some pretty good lyrics &#8211; I probably dreamt them.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>That one really stood out to me as I was revisiting the records. It&#8217;s very catchy.</strong><br/>
Thanks. Yeah, people really love that one. To this day, I&#8217;ve always thought we maybe &#8211; how can I put it? The way we recorded it, it&#8217;s got a real choppy, stop-start-y, edited sort of feel, whereas I personally really love things that groove along, like a dance beat. The other thing is that my guitar part in the chorus is so &#8211; well, it used to be that I couldn&#8217;t actually play and sing the bloody chorus line at the same time. So we stopped playing that one after a while.</p>
<p>But I managed to come up with some pretty good lyrics in that one. Over the years I&#8217;d had comments about the lyrics. Specifically, people like the verse lyric ?I&#8217;m Gene Autry in Lincoln&#8217;s shoes.? This was during the Reagan era, so obviously it was a bit of a portrait of what was going on over there. Plus the chorus has these lyrics: ?I have this recurring dream where I&#8217;m in control.? I don&#8217;t know, I probably just ripped them off from somewhere. No &#8211; probably dreamt them. But they do still resonate in some way.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ClBu6Pxb-PQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve talked about different versions of songs like ?Barbados?. When you play them live now, do you get to finally do songs the way you want to? Sort of rewrite history, in a way?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s kind of a mix. Sometimes we just ignore our recorded version and play it with an updated groove. And then there are other instances where we deliberately try and make them sound like the original recordings. You get a feeling that people want to hear some of the more memorable songs from our repertoire, and of course you want it to sound like the record. Bob Dylan is a great example of this &#8211; the amount of times I&#8217;ve heard people say, ?Yeah, he did ?Like a Rolling Stone? but it was virtually unrecognisable? &#8211; I guess that&#8217;d be interesting, but it&#8217;d be good to hear him sing the chorus a bit like it is on the record.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s always a balance. He takes it to the one extreme, and then there&#8217;s complete faithfulness at the other end.</strong><br/>
Yeah. We&#8217;ve been around so long that we&#8217;ve kind of tried anything. Actually, ?Big on Love? is a really good example because on that one the producer &#8211; Reggie Lucas, the same guy who was involved with ?Barbados? &#8211; played the guitar on the single. I was really pissed off about it and argued. I wanted it to be <em>my* guitar on *my* song on *my* record in *my* band. [*Laughs</em>] But he was one of those old-school producers who would not so much want to put their own imprint on a band&#8217;s sound, but he had an idea of how he thought this composition should sound and he was gonna do anything to get it to sound like that. Even if it meant having to replace the guitarist&#8217;s parts.</p>
<p>I know I should get over it, and in fact I have; I just think it&#8217;s a good example of this sort of shit. To this day I struggle when we have to play the song because, over the years, I&#8217;ve just flat-out refused to play his heavy rock riff that he put on the song. But then inevitably I might do a guest spot with a backing band who have had to learn my material and, sure enough, they&#8217;ll learn it exactly like the record, right down to the heavy, ham-fisted rock guitar sound. More recently we&#8217;ve been playing it, and I&#8217;ve just found myself &#8211; I basically worked out exactly what he played and now I&#8217;ve started playing it. Just over the last year. [<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve come around to it, begrudgingly?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] I still don&#8217;t like it. I just figure that&#8217;s what people are familiar with, and they probably want to hear that.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s the new material sounding, and how far along is it?</strong><br/>
Well, Andrew came over here yesterday with, basically, a rough of the five-track EP. It&#8217;s called <em>GTK*, which is named after a very &#8211; not quite forgotten, but there was a little pop-music TV show in the ?60s &#8211; it used to be on the ABC &#8211; called *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK<em>(TV</em>series">GTK</a>)*. It would come on late-afternoon and they&#8217;d just play one film clip by a band. GTK stands for ?get to know.? So we&#8217;ve stolen that name and it has five tracks on it. I think they&#8217;ve come up really well, but of course it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if people hated it. It&#8217;s a very eclectic mix. I think it sounds like a mature version of our *Cut Lunch/Local and/or General/Pleasure of the Company</em> period.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We have this unique chemistry. I mean, it&#8217;s the same band.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Until now, Mark Ferrie and Barton Price had not actually recorded together with the band, because Barton originally joined during a period when Mark wasn&#8217;t in the band. Mark Ferrie was our bass player until James replaced him, basically. So it&#8217;s a strange kind of circular, cyclical thing in that Mark has now replaced James. So we have this unique chemistry. I mean, it&#8217;s the same band; the material actually does remind me of our early-?80s period, but with our late-?80s big beat.</p>
<p><strong>When you see a band whose records cover different eras, you always wonder what you&#8217;re going to get.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I&#8217;m really delighted that we&#8217;re able to do what we&#8217;re doing these days, because I&#8217;m actually a closet percussionist. I started off on drums when I was about 12 years old. But by the time I was 14 or 15 I&#8217;d switched to guitar, because I&#8217;d decided I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to write songs on the drums. Plus I was considered to be a pretty good singer even back then. I used to work in choirs and stuff. So I just love rhythm, percussion, drumming. Barton Price &#8211; he&#8217;s the dude. He&#8217;s my man. I think his preference is to hit the things really hard and stomp out a big kind of rock beat, but the fact is he&#8217;s from a family of jazz drummers. He can play anything, and for me that&#8217;s an exciting prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Are you singing all the songs now when you guys play live?</strong><br/>
Not quite. Almost. In fact, it&#8217;s always been the case that I&#8217;ve been the main singer and we&#8217;ve just had sort of cameos from the other band members. Both Mark Ferrie and Andrew Duffield sang lead [in places] on every album they were involved with. Andrew&#8217;s always taken a lead spot &#8211; maybe not for a whole song &#8211; but Mark Ferrie certainly has sung lead vocals. He sang a song called ?Pull the Pin? on our first album. He sang ?Unhappy? on <em>Local and/or General</em>.</p>
<p>So when we play live, it&#8217;s not just me. And, indeed, when James Freud was around, for a while he was perceived as the band&#8217;s lead singer because a couple of the tunes that he sang were arguably monster hits. But I&#8217;m still the guy who&#8217;s notched up the most flying hours as the vocalist in the band. And that&#8217;s still the case.</p>
<p><strong>Do you sing James? songs live now?</strong><br/>
I do. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Is that strange, or hard?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it is. I refused emphatically to sing them initially. Then I was involved in a kind of <a href="http://antonk.com/2013/06/09/absolutely-80s-live-shows/">?80s showcase</a> where singers from the ?80s would be backed by a backing band. I was working with Brian Mannix and Scott Carne from Uncanny X-Men and Kids in the Kitchen, respectively. They were already playing ?Out of Mind, Out of Sight? and sharing the lead vocals around, so I suddenly found myself singing a verse. This is when James was still around. And then, on one of those tours, we were in Perth and the promoter didn&#8217;t quite threaten not to pay me if I didn&#8217;t sing ?Barbados?, but he just drove me nuts with the fact that this was his favourite song and would I sing it please.</p>
<p>So eventually I did, and we just kept doing it in that ?80s show when we left Perth. It just seemed obvious to have a crack at it with Models. So yeah, I&#8217;m singing James? songs. It&#8217;s actually really spooky.</p>
<p><strong>That song has the line that became the title of his <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/book/index.aspx&#8217;isbn=9780732274405">memoir</a>: ?I am the voice left from drinking.? It must be especially eerie to sing that.</strong><br/>
It is. But it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m halfway through singing that and I think, ?Oh my god, he&#8217;s gone!? Y&#8217;know, I think about him all the time. So if anything, it&#8217;s kind of nice to be able to perform a little tribute to my lost brother, to my lost comrade.</p>
