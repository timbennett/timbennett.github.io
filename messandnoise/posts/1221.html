                <h3>M+N are asking bands about classic Australian albums &#8211; both the idea of a classic and some prime examples &#8211; as well as posing a few polite questions.
</h3>
<p>Answering this week is Simon Connolly, who plays guitar and sings in Arrester alongside bassist Joe Foley and drummer Jacqui Brannelly. The <a href="/news/4647372">newish</a> Melbourne trio released their five-song debut EP <em><a href="http://arrester.bandcamp.com/album/lift-a-lonely-spell">Lift a Lonely Spell</a></em> this week. It was recorded and mixed by Connolly, who does live sound for a living. They launch the EP on Thursday, July 31 at The Old Bar with support from Gus Rigby and Triple Denim. It&#8217;s $10 at the door from 8:30pm.</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p><strong>a. How did the band come together, beyond the <a href="/search/?q=aleks">Aleks &amp; The Ramps</a> and <a href="/releases/2000426">Potential Falcon</a> connection?</strong><br/>
Basically by late 2012 both those bands had entered a netherworld of hiatus/break up or something and I was still writing songs. I was listening to a lot of Buffalo Tom and Led Zeppelin and Nirvana and keeping an eye out for a good drummer. I knew I&#8217;d do something with Joe again because we basically share a brain after all these years when it comes to music. I mixed Jacqui&#8217;s previous band <a href="http://pourparlour.bandcamp.com/">Pourparlour</a> a few times and she immediately struck me as one of the most compelling drummers I&#8217;d seen in forever. She hits the kick drum so goddamned hard! In August last year I contacted her about playing with Joe and I and it turned out Pourparlour were out of action so the timing was perfect.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>b. Why the name Arrester? Is there a story behind it?</strong><br/>
I was on tour mixing Clubfeet and doing the drive from Melbourne to Adelaide. As you come down through the Adelaide Hills, there are these runoff lanes filled with gravel for vehicles suffering brake failure called ?arrester beds?. I just thought it was a cool sounding word that you don&#8217;t see very often. Also, naming a band is hands down the hardest thing about being in one.</p>
<p><strong>c. ?Teenage Hell? is a real standout on the EP. How personal or autobiographical is it?</strong><br/>
Not really all that personal, more like a series of feelings about early to mid-twenties ennui. Though I definitely spent my teens waiting for ?real life? to begin and cool shit to happen, only to find that life as a functioning adult member of society isn&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. It&#8217;s cool though: I work in the music industry so ?adult life? is still a kind of alien concept. After writing this I joked to Joe that lyrically it was my dolewave track.</p>

<p/>
<h2>What Makes a Classic?</h2>
<p><strong>a. What are some defining qualities that make a classic record?</strong><br/>
Something like a band firing on all cylinders, coupled with a producer/engineer who has a clear vision for the project, probably before the band is too famous. So not much is expected of them by the listening public and they don&#8217;t have too much of an ego going on. If all of that is present and it somehow becomes more than the sum of its parts then you have the making of a classic. I&#8217;d say <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter&#8217;s_Songs">Deserter&#8217;s Songs</a></em> by Mercury Rev is a good example of that. A band at the end of its tether believing they were making their final album but pulling out something timeless.</p>
<p><strong>b. Name a recent Australian record that already feels like a classic.</strong><br/>
Adalita&#8217;s <em><a href="/releases/2001286 ">All Day Venus</a></em>, I reckon. There&#8217;s not a dud track on it, it&#8217;s got a really clear and universally accessible theme and the production makes it sound like you could have released it any time in the last 25 years and it would feel right at home. I listened to it repeatedly when it came out and then went on tour mixing the band and it still sounds fresh to me.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bvrOagQU1iQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>c. What was the first classic Australian record someone introduced you to?</strong><br/>
The first one that I kind of recognised as a classic was probably You Am I&#8217;s <em><a href="/releases/2001214">Hourly Daily</a></em>. I&#8217;d heard plenty of classic Aussie albums prior to that but even at 15 years of age, when that came out it was clearly a VERY IMPORTANT RECORD.</p>
<p><strong>d. Is there a classic ?Australian sound?? If so, what is it?</strong><br/>
The kind of stuff that feels distinctly Australian to me is anything with a real sense of space. Some embodiment of vast distances and empty spaces. It can be achieved through a variety of different production styles, from Triffids-type stuff through to The Fauves? <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_Highways">Lazy Highways</a></em> or anything by <a href=" articles/244834">Bluebottle Kiss</a>, but to paraphrase what Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography, you know it when you hear it.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nu8NOcATtl0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>e. Who&#8217;s your favourite Australian producer, past or present?</strong><br/>
Ah, a trick question! I have to say <a href="/articles/3875654">Simon&#8217;s uncle] Wayne Connolly; he just makes really good records. If [Casey Rice</a> qualifies as Australian yet, I&#8217;d say him too, as far as non-family members go. He is so great at coaxing powerful but natural-sounding records out of bands. Witch Hats? <em><a href="/releases/2000959">Pleasure Syndrome</a></em> sounds so great, and so Australian, to me.</p>
<h2>Five Classics</h2>
<p>Tell us what these five classic Australian albums mean to you:</p>
<p><strong>Bluebottle Kiss</strong> <em>Higher Up the Firetrails</em> (1995)<br/>
Is this one a classic? It&#8217;s a great record and contains all the ingredients of later BBK records but they did release better stuff. When I was in my early teens and starting to get interested in music I would always hassle Wayne to give me stuff to listen to whenever we&#8217;d visit him in Sydney. I remember him giving me a cassette copy of this and telling me it was something he&#8217;d worked on. At the time I probably had one other cassette, that ?Weird Al? Yankovic one with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=FklUAoZ6KxY">Nirvana parody</a> on it. Mum had bought it to go with the Walkman I got for a birthday present or something. I remember thinking there was something wrong with the BBK tape at the time, like it was warped or something &#8211; I&#8217;d never heard anything that noisy and it was tough to wrap my head around. I love the way Jamie Hutchings enunciates (or doesn&#8217;t) and the scrappy Afghan Whigs-style guitar playing that would define their middle period. I wish I could sing or play like that but it&#8217;s never suited me.</p>
<p><strong>The Hummingbirds</strong> <em>LoveBUZZ</em> (1989)<br/>
I should really know this one but I don&#8217;t. Other than ?Blush?, of course.</p>
<p><iframe width="630" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fi35p21eICM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>The Church</strong> <em>Starfish</em> (1988)<br/>
I&#8217;ve never heard this one in full before, just ?Reptile? and ?Under the Milky Way?. I looked up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_(album">Wikipedia article</a>) on it and it says they replaced Richard Ploog&#8217;s drum track with a session musician for ?Under the Milky Way?. That&#8217;s gotta burn! I guess he knows how Ringo and Peter Criss feel. I was about to say I can&#8217;t imagine ever doing something like that but then I remembered I&#8217;ve totally re-recorded people&#8217;s parts before, either ?cause it was too much of a hassle to get them in to do it again or because they just weren&#8217;t cutting it. Usually without saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>Underground Lovers</strong> <em>Rushall Station</em> (1996)<br/>
Another Wayne-produced record. I don&#8217;t know it but it&#8217;s funny, Richard Andrew was a real fixture (not that he&#8217;d know) in my life when I first moved to Melbourne. We were both part of a loose scene that coalesced around a house on Kerr Street in Fitzroy for a number of years. I never knew he was in the band until I was mixing World&#8217;s End Press supporting Manic Street Preachers and they were also on the bill.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qHzWqQcIbTY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Paul Kelly &amp; The Coloured Girls</strong> <em>Gossip</em> (1986)<br/>
This record was one of the few that lived permanently in my family&#8217;s car in the late ?80s and early ?90s, along with R.E.M.?s <em>Green</em>, a Gadflys record and the Violent Femmes? first one. I remember thinking for so long that ?The Coloured Girls? were girls in colourful dresses or something (I am white and middle class) and that Paul Kelly and the Messengers was a wholly different line-up. When I first moved to Melbourne, I worked for a year as a dental assistant; the owner of the practice knew I was a musician and always had me assist when he had a famous music-industry figure as a patient. So I assisted a few times when Mr. Kelly came in. Roughly a decade later, when mixing supports for a Paul Kelly show at The Corner Hotel, I went up and said hi to him and mentioned that I used to work on his teeth with (name redacted). He was very awkward and standoffish, for some reason.</p>
