                <h3>Canberra lynchpin <strong>JORDAN RODGER</strong> (Cinnamon Records) hand-picks five of the most promising bands from the city that brought the world TV Colours. 
</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to fall into a trap of mentioning the Canberra clich&#8217;s when introducing this feature, but its reputation as a small, sad and underappreciated city precedes it. Being so small means that musicians are scarce and spread very thin and venues are few and far between. I myself play in three bands (Primary Colours, Wives, TV Colours) and run a small label called <a href="http://www.cinnamonrecordsmusic.com/">Cinnamon Records</a>, which made writing this an enjoyable challenge, but in the past few months Canberra has blossomed with new music. Old projects have ended, meaning new ones can rise from their ashes, and our principle venue (<a href="http://lovethephoenix.com/">The Phoenix Pub</a>) has reopened, which has give everyone new hope. Maybe we can shake the ?underdog city? chip off our shoulder.</p>
<h2>Mind Blanks</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040531/640x360-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Mind Blanks are a guitarist&#8217;s wet dream, filling the stage with huge walls of fuzz, feedback and, of course, more guitar amps than necessary. Taking you to the warm happy grunge place everyone has secretly in their heart. They have just popped up on the radar, playing only a handful of shows so far, however the band members are no strangers to the Canberra music scene.</p>
<p>Peter is the guitarist, vocalist and instigator of this new project and a much-loved Canberra multi-instrumentalist, playing in a long string of bands including Condorcet, Voss, Fig Newlies, Shopgirl, Hutt River Province and the list could go on. Drummer Tim made up one half of the infamous <a href="http://assassins.bandcamp.com/">Assassins 88</a>, and currently also plays in <a href="/articles/4637287">TV Colours</a> (as does bass player Robin) and <a href="http://cinnamonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/wives-buried">Wives</a>. Nicholas M is the new kid on the block, but his controlled and direct guitar style, coupled with Peter&#8217;s larger-than-life chords, help to create powerful sheets of sound, which wrap up the neat vocal hooks that give the songs a sort of pop sensibility. It&#8217;d be easy to blindly compare Mind Blanks to MBV or Dinosaur Jr., but through paying their respects to the ?90s noise-guitar gods the band aren&#8217;t emulating; they&#8217;re creating something new and exciting.</p>

<h2>California Girls</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040530/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Picture a man on stage bashing an almost toy-like drum pad, creating layers of melodic guitar loops and singing his heart out about love and lust, and you&#8217;ll almost get a sense of what California Girls is about. Gus McGrath is a Canberra super musician currently playing in Wives, Primary Colours and Nature Kids, and formerly in Oxen and Beach Slut. California Girls is his solo venture, through which he gets to take control and combine his love of ?80s synth-pop, dance and New Wave with thoughtful guitar lines that wink at his heroes New Order, but that are also reminiscent of ?60s pop in their potency.</p>
<p>McGrath&#8217;s strength as a live artist is his charm on stage as he draws the audience in with throbbing grooves, which sound positively antique due to his equipment but also innovative due to his skills as a drummer. It&#8217;s impressive to watch the loops develop, which can sometimes be a tedious task for other solo acts, and it&#8217;s easy to see that McGrath is completely enthralled and entranced during each song. The debut California Girls cassette <em><a href="http://cinnamonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/california-girls-age-of-consent-ep">Age of Consent</a></em> is out through Cinnamon Records, and there&#8217;s no doubt that there are only good things to come.</p>

<p/>
<h2>Alphamale</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040529/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The music Hannah de Feyter makes is hard to pinpoint in that it&#8217;s constantly shifting and growing, much like the sounds she creates with her viola, voice and effects pedals. I hesitate to use the genre tag ?noise? or ?experimental?, as it usually deems the artist to be difficult listening by most, which in Alphamale&#8217;s case is quite the opposite.  Her soundscapes can be anything from the gentle pulse of a treated viola, which is instantly recognisable as de Feyter&#8217;s sound, to a powerful wall of tones and feedback which avoid being abrasive and instead envelop the room in a strangely comforting way.</p>
<p>Alphamale&#8217;s performances are often shy ones, but this adds to the mysterious nature of the sounds she creates. Although the music is completely improvised, the tone of de Feyter&#8217;s viola and her approach to manipulating its sound are unique. This can be a rare quality in an ?experimental? musician and it&#8217;s one of the many things that makes Alphamale an act to watch out for in the future. De Feyter is currently making music in New York and plans to release a new cassette when she returns to the Nation&#8217;s Capital later this year.</p>

<p/>
<h2>New Age Group</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040532/594x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>?We&#8217;re New Age Group! We&#8217;re a new breed of men!? is the first thing to come from Dominic Shanahan&#8217;s mouth at the first New Age Group show before they launch into a two-minute burst of energetic, honest and incredibly catchy punk and power-pop combination. Dom is kind of Canberra music royalty, having played in Are The Brave All Dead and fronting <a href="/releases/2000972">The Fighting League</a>. He&#8217;s joined by Owen Fischbein, usually seen in a heavier light playing as part of <a href="http://hygiene-cbr.bandcamp.com/">Hygiene</a>, Peter (Mind Blanks) and all-round good bloke Chris Malone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to completely sum up the band, having only played one show, but it seems fitting to include New Age Group as a band to watch. Their debut set was full of wit and charm, all backed up by strong yet simple tunes. The chunky guitar sound and blistering lead from Peter is coupled with Dom&#8217;s jangling chords and unmistakeable voice, which always manages to bring a smile to faces in the audience. The bass lines are distorted and fast but still melodic, and Chris? drumming is pounding with urgency (think <em>Pink Flag</em>-era Wire. Be on the lookout for a debut release from New Age Group; I&#8217;m definitely excited to see and hear more.</p>

<h2>Raus</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040533/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Raus is the project of Rory Stenning, who sings and controls synths and other electronic elements, and Luke Keenan-Brown, who drums and has his own fair share of pads and electronics. All too often it&#8217;s easy to stereotype ?electronic? music as just being a body and a laptop, but Raus manages to avoid these clich&#8217;s by combining a live drum kit and percussion (Stenning plays a mean cowbell) with the throbs and glitches of their synths. Although this isn&#8217;t a new formula, Raus have a mesmerising and hypnotic presence on stage and a musical unpredictability that makes them an undeniably strong live act.</p>
<p>The debut record from Raus, <em><a href="/articles/4670987">LP</a>*, is divided in two distinct parts. Side A features three shorter, vocal-orientated tracks which prove Stenning&#8217;s strength as both a songwriter and a vocalist. He croons his easily hummable melodies in a register that most male singers can only dream about. The duo also have a strong improvisational side and comfortably drift into cosmic Krautrock jams which explore their obvious love of groove; this is documented on Side B of *LP</em> with dreamy saxophone loops and spacey static. Watch out for Raus.</p>
