                <h3>An unexpected detour in the world of children&#8217;s music has inspired the loose, improvisational feel of Holly Throsby&#8217;s new album &#8216;Team&#8217;, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3019322/448x296-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
You can tell a lot about someone&#8217;s sensibilities based on what member of The Beatles, or what song off <em>69 Love Songs</em> they prefer. Holly Throsby&#8217;s favourite is ?The Book Of Love?, Stephin Merritt&#8217;s stark and intimate mediation on the irrationalities of love: ?The book of love is long and boring/No one can lift the damn thing/It&#8217;s full of charts and facts and figures/And instructions for dancing/But I love it when you read to me.?</p>
<p>?It&#8217;s a beautiful song,? says Throsby, who&#8217;s been creating similarly hushed pop statements since 2004 debut <em>On Night*. New album *Team* continues in a similar vein, but there&#8217;s a organic and loose feel to it that Throsby says was inspired by the children&#8217;s album she made around the same time. Laden with zany sound effects and a natural joie de vivre, *See!* was recorded in the same 19th-century sandstone church in Wildes Meadow, NSW, where she paired up with friend and producer Tony Dup? for *Team</em>.</p>
<p>The pair had previously collaborated on <em>On Night* and 2006?s *Under The Town*, but were estranged for 2008?s ARIA-nominated *A Loud Call*, which was recorded in Nashville by Mark Nevers (Lambchop, Andrew Bird). *Team</em> features noticeably pared-back contributions by Throsby&#8217;s band The Hello Tigers (Bree van Reyk on drums and percussion and Jens Birchall on cello, bass and mandolin), as well as Dup? (organ, string arrangements) and violinist Veronique Serret (of Joanna Newsom&#8217;s band). It was later mixed at Sydney&#8217;s BJB Studios and the Old General Store in Jumbunna, Victoria, by Burke Reid and Machine Translations? J. Walker, respectively.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We felt loose and free after we&#8217;d done the children&#8217;s album, and we carried that over into making this one.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;re back [working] with Tony?</strong><br/>
It was a happy accident, really. Gearing up to the recording, I wanted to make the children&#8217;s album and I wanted to make this album, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how or where to do either of them. He literally just showed up on my doorstep, because he&#8217;d been in Berlin for some time. </p>
<p>Tony&#8217;s a bit hopeless on email &#8211; we&#8217;ll have a really great informative email every six months &#8211; so I hadn&#8217;t seen him for a long time. He decided to come back to Sydney, and arrived and said, ?Can I stay here?? He ended up staying at my house for a couple weeks, which was really nice for me at the time, because we were both in a similar headspace. We reconnected and had this nice time. He was about to find somewhere to set up the studio, was looking on Domain [www.domain.com.au] on the computer, and found this church. I looked at the pictures, and it looked great. I thought he&#8217;d be a great person to do the children&#8217;s album, let alone the <em>Team</em> album. I think we both felt like doing something different. I went down [to the church] to do the kids? album and as soon as I arrived there, I knew that was where I wanted to do both of them.</p>
<p><strong>What prompted the children&#8217;s album?</strong><br/>
It was something I was thinking about for a couple years, more as a joke than anything. I thought it&#8217;d be fun to make one for friends who had kids. I have a goddaughter who&#8217;s going to be five in March and she has a little brother, and lots of my friends have kids. Just hanging out with them, and babysitting them, and driving around in the car listening to this children&#8217;s music that just made me want to stab my ears out [<em>laughs</em>], I thought it&#8217;d be a nice idea to make an album that wasn&#8217;t like warbling ?Itsy Bitsy Spider? over a really bad background &#8211; I thought the children deserved more than that. </p>
<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s music out there for kids that people are making with a similar aesthetic to the way they make their own music. In America, there&#8217;s a little scene of musicians who are in big bands, who have a kids side project, probably because they have kids or hang out with kids. That&#8217;s where it came from for me: I wanted to be a diligent godmother and make this album. As we went along, we got more and more into it. We did sound effects and recorded children and their voices and went to schools. I went to a lot of children&#8217;s birthday parties, and I&#8217;d get all the kids around a recorder in the living room and ask them to say things. It was a really fun project that Tony and I got more and more involved in and excited about. It certainly put us in a good mood.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider the two albums companion pieces?</strong><br/>
Absolutely not. [<em>Laughs*] After we finished the kids album, I went overseas for a few weeks. I had an 80th birthday, actually, a family friend in Arizona. I came back and we started making *Team*. I think one informed the other: we felt loose and free after we&#8217;d done the children&#8217;s album, and we carried that over into making this one. Even though it sounds completely different, considering our tendency to be particular sometimes, I feel that with a lot of the songs on *Team</em>, the arrangements are improvised, the singing and the vocal takes and the overlapping of various things are something that we just wanted to let happen and leave as it was. That was a nice experience to make it that way.</p>
<p><strong>Was <em>See</em> a more constructed record?</strong><br/>
No, it was a very live record and really played. The thing that was constructed about it was arranging the sound effects and all the voices. Luckily, that was such a fun thing to arrange. The arrangements are actually quite intricate and you can really tell we tried our hardest to make them as bursting with life as we could. That was really fun. It was one of those processes where it also relied on a random nature to do all that kind of stuff: one time throwing a lot of stuff at it; and another time, just letting all the stuff exist together and be a little crazy and weird. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the status of that record?</strong><br/>
I can&#8217;t believe you missed it. It&#8217;s out already! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s weird. We didn&#8217;t receive any promo copies.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughter*] I don&#8217;t think they thought *Mess+Noise* would review it! It came out on ABC [Music] last October. It&#8217;s funny, Aaron [Curnow] at Spunk has a couple kids now and he&#8217;s really supportive of the record. He thought it was a funny, stupid thing to do. [*Laughs</em>] But he was like, ?How the hell are Spunk going to do a kids? album?? He helped A&amp;R it for me with ABC. He called them up, but they didn&#8217;t really understand at first why he was calling. Aaron&#8217;s a great guy and he really believed in it, but also didn&#8217;t know what the hell to do with it on his own label. We thought it [ABC] would be the right place for it. But it&#8217;s a different world. You get letters from toddlers. It&#8217;s really cute.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Have your adult fans warmed to the record too?</strong><br/>
I think it&#8217;s an entirely different thing. The ones with kids really appreciate it, and I&#8217;ve had some lovely responses. But obviously a lot of people that own that record have know idea what else I do. They probably just think I&#8217;m a children&#8217;s artist. The kind of media that covered the record, I didn&#8217;t even know existed. I don&#8217;t read parenting magazines! [<em>Laughs</em>] It was a funny experience. I said to ABC when it came out that I&#8217;m not a children&#8217;s entertainer, I&#8217;m not going to do a tour or anything. They seemed very understanding already, which was nice of them. I just wanted to have kids on the cover and kids on the video, just a nice informative record of funny sounds and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Going back to <em>Team*, the approach sounds incredibly naturalistic. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard The Magnetic Fields album *Realism</em>?</strong><br/>
No, I haven&#8217;t actually. Should I have?</p>
<p><strong>Well, it&#8217;s got a similar approach: just organic, acoustic, wooden instruments.</strong><br/>
I know <em>69 Love Songs</em> well. I really love the song, ?The Book Of Love?. It&#8217;s a beautiful song. Obviously with this album, there&#8217;s a degree of technical trickery, but done in a very organic way. We use loops sometimes, but we always record things and make a loop out of that. Everyone has their own idiosyncratic rhythm. One of the songs that&#8217;s looped is just a half bar of me singing. We looped that to get a rhythm that is in the song &#8211; you can&#8217;t just do that with making a click out of anything. If we start a song that way, that thing needs to be born naturally. With the other arrangements, it&#8217;s mainly improvised and with acoustic instruments.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>With Tony do you have that sort of relationship where you don&#8217;t even need to look at each other; things just tend to happen.</strong><br/>
We do. He certainly knows what I like, and I think we have the same taste. I really trust him, especially with the arrangements. He has a lovely sensibility. With this album, we discussed it quite a lot in terms of the vocals. I don&#8217;t demo anything. I&#8217;m not very good at recording stuff &#8211; I just use my iPhone&#8217;s voice recorder, I can&#8217;t use Pro Tools or anything like that. But I had to demo this album because of all the different vocal parts. I used GarageBand &#8211; so I had these arrangements set in place for the vocals. Even though they changed heaps, it was just a general idea for how they would work. It was a different thing to bring to Tony, because he then wanted to do a similar thing with the instruments: have Jens [Birchall] do a group of cello passes and bring them together and have them work in the same way as the vocals did. Of course, as you&#8217;re recording, it&#8217;s not like you stick to this rule, but it was a nice approach to begin with it went from there.</p>
<p><strong>Was that layered vocal approach inspired by anything in particular?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I really like that first Pinback album, <em>This Is Pinback</em> [1999]. Apparently they [Armistead Burwell Smith IV and Rob Crow] both had an instrumental track they would write, and then both would write a song over that with lyrics and a melody, and then they&#8217;d combine the two songs. A lot of my favourite songs on that start with a pattern and then another vocal will overlap it. I thought about it a lot and how much I liked that. With this album, one of the first songs I wrote was ?We Are Glowing?. I decided to use that approach and liked how it turned out, so I applied it to a lot of the songs like ?Here Is My Co-Pilot? or ?To See You Out? and ?What I Thought Of You?. I like the blend that you get. Because you sing the different parts in different ways it&#8217;s like various things being said to you at once. It&#8217;s a nicely confusing thing to hear in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Your earlier albums were written at a time of despair, but with this one I feel like you&#8217;re in a happier place.</strong><br/>
Ah, do you think? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>To me it&#8217;s a very poignant record, and I think the cover image really lends that feel to it.</strong><br/>
I think everybody hears something different, but there is a certain amount of optimism. The single [?Here Is My Co-Pilot?] is very unlike the rest of the record in a lot of ways &#8211; even though it was done at the same time. But everyone hears things differently.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>So I was totally wrong?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] No, not at all. Some people say, ?Gosh, this album&#8217;s bleak?, and there&#8217;s others that say, ?You&#8217;ve found your happy place.? It&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a thread of optimism that comes through quite strong for me anyway.</strong><br/>
Well, that&#8217;s good. It does for me as well.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the lyrical preoccupation with ?teams? come from?</strong><br/>
Oh, I don&#8217;t even know! [<em>Laughs</em>] I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking about at the time, but it wasn&#8217;t sport that&#8217;s for sure. I was always doing non-sport [at school], where you had to sit in a room while everyone else was doing sport. It was non-scripture in primary school, which was my favourite class because you just got to do nothing. But, yeah, I don&#8217;t know where that come from.</p>
<p><strong>Was it a concept that guided the record?</strong><br/>
No, I think it was something that people, or I maybe noticed later. I like the way different parts work together, but that&#8217;s what happens with every record. I just try and not think about it too much, but when you listen to all the songs in a row it kinda makes sense together.</p>
