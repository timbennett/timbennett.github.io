                <h3>Acres of space, sunshine and performances by The Clean, Os Mutantes and Joanna Newsom &#8211; <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>* reports on a very fine day one of the fifth annual Golden Plains. Photos by *</em>MATTHEW HARDING</strong>.
</h3>
<h2>Saturday, March 12</h2>
<p>?Space for you,? promised the eloquently worded introduction in the souvenir handbook for this year&#8217;s Golden Plains. Five years down the track, it&#8217;s still the thing that sets the festival apart from its big sister Meredith. Perhaps it was the $350 ticket price (hefty, until you consider Golden Plains has no commercial involvement), or the summer festival hangover, but there were still tickets available at the gate for the first time in history. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a reflection on the line-up, which featured some genuine icons from all corners of the globe &#8211; New Zealand&#8217;s The Clean, Brazil&#8217;s Os Mutantes, Victoria&#8217;s Cosmic Psychos, Brisbane&#8217;s favourite son Robert Forster, Hawkwind from the UK and, of course, Meredith&#8217;s own <a href="http://2011.goldenplains.com.au/what-goes-on/silence-wedge/">Silence Wedge</a>.</p>
<p>Even when at capacity &#8211; 8900 people, as opposed to Meredith&#8217;s 11,500 &#8211; Golden Plains is still one of the least stressful experiences on the Australian festival circuit. Driving in at 11am, we used our staff vehicle pass to overtake exactly four cars, while watching a band from the front of the Supernatural Amphitheatre didn&#8217;t require any nifty maneuvering or elbow grease. (There was even room to dance.)</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3019119/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>A long blink from festival co-founder Chris Nolan kicked things off at 2pm. Nolan, as everyone&#8217;s probably well aware, is severely disabled (blinking is his only way of communicating with the world), but he&#8217;s still very much the pulse of this festival and it&#8217;s always a pleasure seeing him on stage or in his ?pavilion? at the back of the Amphitheatre. (The Nolans had something extra to celebrate this year, with mum Mary part of the Australia Day honours list. She&#8217;s now officially Mary Nolan AM.)</p>
<p>It seems cliche to talk about the weather, but given the whole thing takes place outdoors and hasn&#8217;t exactly enjoyed the best conditions in recent years, it&#8217;d be remiss not to mention how perfect day one was. There was no <a href="/news/4144863">?extreme sogginess?</a>. No <a href="/events/9774#review_448319">heat waves</a>. No <a href="/articles/3436968">torrential downpour</a>. Just 30-odd degrees and clear blue skies; an anomalous year in Meredith&#8217;s life-span, and most of us returned with sunburn as a souvenir.</p>
<p>San Francisco&#8217;s <strong>Sonny &amp; The Sunsets?</strong> scrappy, carefree jams would&#8217;ve been much better served on Sunday afternoon, but as late additions to the bill they didn&#8217;t get much of a say. Great songs though, especially ?Too Young To Burn? and ?Planet Of Women?, which is set (appropriately) in space.</p>
<p>?Not much changes over 24 years,? said <strong>Cosmic Psychos?</strong> bass player/singer Ross Knight in his best ocker voice. ?We started out as young grumpy cunts and now we&#8217;re old grumpy cunts.? The passage of time has done little to tarnish the Psychos? ferocity either, with Knight&#8217;s hyper bogan snarls pairing like a pie and sauce with John ?Mad Macka? McKeering&#8217;s incessant wah wailing. The Psychos were just the VB-swilling primer the crowd were after, and my lukewarm green apple UDL seemed an inappropriate drink. They ended the set with ?Dead In A Ditch?, which is exactly how I&#8217;d feel come first thing Sunday morning. Psychos <em>and</em> psychic.</p>
<p>The less said about Memphis? <strong>Magic Kids<em>* the better &#8211; they literally cleared the Amphitheatre &#8211; while *</em>Justin Townes Earle</strong> earned the first boot of the weekend for his classy, countrified set and cover of The Replacements? ?Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait? (sans sax solo unfortunately). The boot is one of Golden Plains? most loved traditions &#8211; it was <a href="http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/27673/The-story-behind-the-Golden-Plains-Boot&#8217;page=1">started by Cherry Bar co-owner James Young</a> at the first Golden Plains in 2007 during Comets on Fire &#8211; but it&#8217;s getting a bit out of hand. When three acts &#8211; Townes Earle, Graveyard Train and The Besnard Lakes &#8211; collectively cop the boot, it kinda defeats the purpose, doesn&#8217;t it? We need consensus, people, if this wonderful and organic tradition is going to become a fixture. (Much to the chagrin of a flame-haired friend, one Golden Plains tradition that looks set to continue is the ginger flash-mob at the Red Tree. Although, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/gingers-extinct-in-100-years-say-scientists/story-e6frfkp9-1111114243424">genetics will reportedly take care of that</a> in 100 years.)</p>
<p>Playing for the first time in Australia for 22 years, New Zealand&#8217;s <strong>The Clean</strong> were wonderfully shambolic &#8211; even though I have a sneaking suspicion they could play a tight set of prog if they wanted to. They ended 10 minutes early with an abrasive bit of noise that shows just how indebted bands like Eddy Current are to them.</p>

<p>If there was an anti-boot award it&#8217;d have to go to <strong>Joanna Newsom</strong>, the diminutive American harpist who confounded most of the crowd with a strange and divisive set. It wasn&#8217;t that Newsom was bad &#8211; no matter what you thought of her music, she was a captivating presence, seamlessly gliding between harp and piano &#8211; it&#8217;s more that no one wants to be challenged when the sun&#8217;s going down and the poison&#8217;s kicking in on the first night of a festival. (A fun fact: Newsom was the first artist to ever soundcheck at either Meredith or Golden Plains. She apparently drove down and set up her harp on Friday, playing a few songs out into an empty field. I would&#8217;ve liked to have been there for that.)</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3019111/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Midway through Newsom&#8217;s set &#8211; around the time her yelps started to become grating &#8211; I watched the sun set at Inspiration Point, a rock garden just past the food stalls to the left of the stage. Aunty Meredith describes the place as ?secluded? and ?romantic? &#8211; that must&#8217;ve been before people decided to use it as a driving range.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, <strong>Os Mutantes</strong> helped usher in an artistic revolution in Brazil; more than 40 years later they battled to get a bunch of hipsters to dance. The crowd (at least the section I was in) were strangely subdued for a set that took in a world of music &#8211; from rock&#8217;n?roll to baroque pop, bastardised bossa nova (Caetano Veloso&#8217;s ?Baby?) to psychedelia. ?Minha Menina? &#8211; a song used in a McDonald&#8217;s commercial and famously covered by UK rock band, The Bees &#8211; sounded naked without the original&#8217;s fuzz, while ?Bat Macumba? finally got the crowd moving, sparking an on-stage dance off featuring one of the Brown sisters from Otouto.</p>

<p>New York&#8217;s <strong>The Hold Steady</strong> triggered a bracket of party rock and meaty riffs that continued with Warrnambool&#8217;s Airbourne and wound up at 1.30am with San Diego&#8217;s Wavves. Spasmodic and seemingly possessed, The Hold Steady&#8217;s bespectacled lead singer Craig Finn spat out his Bukwoski-isms over a relentless twin-guitar attack (was his third guitar, a Gibson, even plugged in?), with the band tackling the set as if it were a medley. By the time they finished with ?Your Little Hoodrat Friend? from 2005?s <em>Separation Sunday</em>, there was a heaving mosh at the front of the stage.</p>
<p>Is there any band on the planet more committed to the aging bloated carcass of classic rock than <strong>Airbourne<em>*? The band embrace every well-worn clich? like a badge of honour, and there&#8217;s something endearingly stupid about the way Joel O&#8217;Keeffe does his banter in falsetto. ?Shirrrrazzzzz from the Barossa Valleyyyy,? he squealed while necking what was probably a bottle of $10 Rawson&#8217;s Retreat. Fuck yeah. *</em>Wavves</strong> continued the big dumb riffs, but for a 45-minute set the whole thing seemed to drag on for hours. The pay-off was closing single ?Post Acid?, which was preceded by singer Nathan Williams berating a security guard for some supposedly heavy-handed tactics. He hasn&#8217;t been seen since.</p>
