                <h3><strong>A.H. CAYLEY<em>* reports on day two of the fifth annual Golden Plains festival in Meredith, Victoria, which saw ?Booty-worthy? performances by the likes of The Besnard Lakes, Graveyard Train, Imelda May, Pulled Apart By Horses, and pretty much everyone else who played.

<p>Having slept through the emergency warning system that usually serves as a wake up call, we walk from our campsite, on the top-most right hand corner of map, at the end of the road named Happy Endings. On the other side of the festival boundary a large light stack stands lifeless, though the night before it attracted hundreds and hundreds of swirling moths as it illuminated our campsite, each creature lit up both individually and as a part of the whole. I remember noting that it was the most beautiful thing I&#8217;d ever seen in my entire life before ripping off the sequins on my face because they couldn&#8217;t compare, an admission that probably gives some indication as to why I slept through the emergency warning system this morning.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3019141/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Onstage, futurist <strong>Dr Peter Ellyard</strong> presents the keynote address, a take on the topic of Golden Plains 2050. I wish I could make money by reading current trends to loosely ?predict? future ones. Sociological cold reading. Nothing new is covered here &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s safe to say most people at this festival do care about the environment (good insight, bro!) &#8211; except for Ellyard&#8217;s explanations of how he approaches these concepts that are not new. He presents an optimistic future, which is a nice thing to wake up to, and it&#8217;s interesting enough, but when he uses the word ?destiny? without any irony, I realise just how much I don&#8217;t care and head off to the Community Tucker Tent for two bacon-and-egg sandwiches and a coffee.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any band could have woken the crowd as well as <strong>Graveyard Train</strong>, particularly with lead singer Nick Finch screaming ?WAKE UP!? to much laughter. A singalong of ?Move Like a Mummy? spreads among the crowd, particularly exciting the sole shoulder-sitter who&#8217;s toilet papered himself for the occasion. He even receives kudos later on as Finch sings a staccato, ?This is a song for the guy with all the toilet paper on?, and once the crowd disperses it&#8217;s clear just how popular Graveyard Train has become. Two-ply dude isn&#8217;t the only one &#8211; about a dozen D&#8217;a de los Muertos get-ups of varying effort levels pass by on their way back to bush camp, as well as two zombies (including a sexy nurse zombie) and a corpse bride. By the time Finch enters into one of the best set closers I&#8217;ve seen so early in the day at this festival (?Everyone one of us will die; there will be nothing left of your lives, so enjoy it while you can &#8211; everybody up the front, you&#8217;re all gonna fucking die, it&#8217;s gonna be awful! Enjoy yourselves! This is our hippy philosophy in Graveyard Train. We&#8217;re like the Polyphonic Spree up here&#8221;) the majority of the crowd is standing, holding their hands in the air (?Raise your hands, raise your voices,?) and for a few, holding their footwear too. It won&#8217;t be the last time today.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3019140/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>Boy and Bear</strong> are surprisingly good in this setting, though it doesn&#8217;t seem as powerful coming after Graveyard Train. Still, it&#8217;s lovely music for sitting under the unseasonably clear sky with a pink flamingo in hand, making new friends at the bar. (Hi, Peter and Jess.) I only hope the band can create a more distinctive sound for themselves. A cover of Crowded House&#8217;s ?Fall At Your Feet? &#8211; Boy and Bear&#8217;s biggest hit so far &#8211; receives the most recognition of their entire set, and even then it&#8217;s nowhere near the reaction earned by Neil Finn&#8217;s rendition <a href="/articles/4149029">of the same song in this same place</a> just three months ago.</p>
<p>Pre-noon flamingos finished, we find our friends among the crowd by their beer can trident held aloft. <strong>Wildbird and Peacedrums</strong> begin a beautiful and powerful set, as we settle into an inflatable lounge and get handed cups of ?buzz juice?, a cocktail so irresponsible I can&#8217;t conscionably publish its ingredients here. You always know you&#8217;re in for a good festival when there&#8217;s a skull and crossbone smoking a giant doobie on the label. Onstage, Mariam Wallentin&#8217;s voice leads her husband Andreas Werliin&#8217;s slowly stomping bass drones, her steel drums adding a brightness of colour without lessening the haunting effect. It becomes more joyous as the keys kick in and the drums get bashed, but it still maintains a hint of darkness. The weather turns moody with the music, and for the first time this weekend, the clouds seem to threaten rain. Golden Plains starts to feel normal again.</p>
<p>Fitting in a lavatory break before The Middle East, I notice a pile of toilet paper bundles in the corner of my cubicle. May I suggest the installation of sanitary bins next year? With the signs inside the composting toilets requesting no foreign objects be thrown inside, menstruating women are left with few disposal choices. Throwing a pad, tampon or liner into the toilet would ruin the entire process, while leaving their used products in a heap in the corner really isn&#8217;t the nicest option for the volunteers charged with the upkeep of the toilets. </p>
<p><strong>The Middle East</strong> play a set much harder than the standard melodic folk rock set that was expected, and really give it their all. Those up the front jump and dance along, while those up the back laze around on sofas, tarps and arm chairs and create their own soundtracked fun. An inflatable UFO is thrown around to cheers from the crowd. It gets caught in an air current before slowly gliding all the way down again, seemingly in time with the ?la la las? coming from the stage. A new acquaintance describes it as blissful, and I can only smile and nod in my inability to find a more apt word. Take another sip of buzz juice, stretch out, close your eyes. Just blissful.</p>

<p>Most bands have a singer; they sing over the music. This isn&#8217;t the case with <strong>Besnard Lakes</strong>. Here, the voice is an instrument, played not on top of the music but as a part of it. It&#8217;s only used as often as is necessary, too &#8211; instrumental psych jams make up a good portion of the set, also never extending longer than is necessary. Even the inflatable UFO seems to float with more power behind it, and soon bassist Olga Goreas can be heard saying she&#8217;s never seen a sea of shoes before. Again, this is not the last time today there will be attempts to award ?The Boot?, though this instance seems to be the strongest. I keep my boots on, but only because my socks are already dirty and fucked up enough from trying to reward Os Mutantes last night (it didn&#8217;t happen). </p>
<p>There are those suggesting that, through overuse, The Boot is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=YlGqN3AKOsA">OVER</a>, but is it really such a big deal? It&#8217;s a shoe in the air, people. It was an amazing, organic piece of crowd interaction that became part of the GP mythology and has now become commonplace. This was bound to happen. Incidentally, did you know more than 3000 people died in Japan last week?</p>
<p><strong>Pulled Apart By Horses</strong> do a quick mic check while I enjoy a life-affirming yellow lentil roti under a poncho on the ground. I almost choke on it in laughter as lead singer Tom Hudson screams ?CHOP YA KNOB OFF?, and from that point on I wish I enjoyed their music more. It&#8217;s a hard punk set, and perfect to jump up and down to, but it all just sounds the same, each song to the other and every song to any other hardcore act. It&#8217;s the banter that wins them over, be it declaring everyone at the festival smells like a rapist, screaming ?LET&#8217;S SHIT ON SAWDUST!? before launching into another stock-standard song, or in congratulating everyone involved with Golden Plains ?for kicking everybody else&#8217;s dicks in?. A topless man and woman run past with tuxedos painted onto their torsos, and Hudson orders everyone to high five the person next to them, which everyone does, and it&#8217;s audible. The set ends with Hudson crowd surfing to the sound desk to much applause, getting sprayed by countless cans of shaken beer upon arrival. Boots are held up.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of derision reserved for <strong>Best Coast</strong> among so many &#8211; perhaps a direct reaction to the hype previously thrown their way. Still, I don&#8217;t quite get it. They play an inoffensively standard garage rock set of sunny party jams that gets people dancing and having fun (with a little girl on tambo invited onstage to sing along). But it&#8217;s nothing new, the dissenters say. They sound like every other surf rock garage band. So why doesn&#8217;t every other surf rock garage band get the same scorn? It&#8217;s Super Wild Horses Syndrome. If you&#8217;re different in appearance, you&#8217;re expected to be different in sound, too, and I&#8217;m sorry, only men are allowed to play the same lazy stuff that&#8217;s been churned out for years to welcoming listeners. Thankfully, SWH have now risen above it all, to some acclaim. Good luck to you, Best Coast. I don&#8217;t love you, but I don&#8217;t hate you either.</p>

<p>DL: The <a href="/icons/3960955">iconic</a> <strong>Robert Forster</strong> is dressed like a hip high school principal. He&#8217;s wearing a casual sportscoat and an open-neck shirt, which prompted the guys behind me to dream up a fictional band called ?Bob Forster and The Staff Lounge Swingers?, in which he fronts a combo formed of high school teachers playing an end-of-year dinner-dance. It was a comment based on appearance, not the quality of performance, however, which was understated and classy and as memorable as you&#8217;d expect. Forster was gracious and funny. He busted out some great interpretive dance moves during ?Darlinghurst Nights?, and announced, ?Here comes a guitar solo?, before stumbling through one of the worst I&#8217;ve ever heard &#8211; presumably on purpose &#8211; to much amusement from the crowd. Highlights were the Go-Bees classics: ?Spring Rain?, which foreshadowed a few light afternoon showers; the wonderfully laconic ?Head Full of Steam?; ?Surfing Magazines?, which was accompanied by a crowd singalong; and set closer, ?Here Comes A City?. There was nothing but reverence and smiles from the crowd.</p>

<p>AC: Things get a bit fuzzy here. My notes show just one line about <strong>Imelda May</strong>: I think I&#8217;m going to describe her as ?sassy?. Critic in-joke. She too receives plenty of boots, her strong voice and fierce character commanding attention from everyone who gleefully moves along with her. She&#8217;s most endearing in her banter &#8211; a polite, utterly grateful Irish girl beaming at her crowd. A cover of ?Tainted Love? is not the karaoke fest is could have been, and she takes the entire crowd from silence to blasting volume in a call and answer of the ?woah ohs?. By now the night is really beginning, and everyone throws caution to the wind.</p>
<p>One thing that always sets both Golden Plains and Meredith apart is the care and support from organisers towards punters. With regular reminders before housekeeping (for which the clean up song is DMX&#8217;s ?Party Up (Up In Here)?) that the first aid staff will not dob anyone in for drug use, and that everyone should look out for each other, it&#8217;s no surprise no serious freak-outs or meltdowns have been reported.</p>
<p>While <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> take to the stage, a man in a yellow jumpsuit with a Charlie Sheen quote taped to he back walks past, asking everyone if they&#8217;re ?winning?. The answer is a yes from all. Onstage, lead singer Stuart Murdoch spies two girls at the very back standing on the shoulders of others, and asks them to walk on the heads of the crowd to get to the front. ?I must have them.? They both take one step and are swallowed up. It could have been a moment. The band plays a joyous cover of The Kinks? ?Victoria? in honour of the state we&#8217;re all in. Really, we&#8217;re all in a few states. Friends of mine cradle a cordial bottle full of $6 port. They&#8217;re somewhere else completely.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie Lidell&#8217;s</strong> quite divisive. Friends tell me it&#8217;s the set of the night for them. Others say it&#8217;s the worst. I sit somewhere in between, but on the more positive side. My world hasn&#8217;t been changed, but his technique of layered vocal melodies and percussion underneath his own soul lyrics is fascinating, and so well done that it&#8217;s easy to miss, particularly with his band providing such a good backdrop to his theatrics. I can&#8217;t quite make out the nature of his outfit but it&#8217;s fabulous either way.</p>
<p>While the stage is set up for <strong>Architecture in Helsinki</strong>, one of those joyful, beautiful Golden Plains moments occurs. From beneath the massive pine to the left of the sound desk, an entire box of ready-cracked glowsticks is thrown into the air. More are thrown back in retaliation from the other side of the crowd. More and more are thrown around, in large bunches or individually, the crowd cheering with the makeshift fireworks display. It&#8217;s glorious, the whole scene &#8211; the stage lights, the lanterns, the string of bulbs from tree to tree &#8211; coming together in technicolour. It peters out as the band comes on, clad entirely in white tail suits but for Kellie Sutherland, in a green sequin disco dress, matching the bow ties or lapel details of the suits. </p>

<p>Seen from the Pink Flamingo, it&#8217;s a fun set in a gorgeous scene. From the middle of the crowd, it&#8217;s something else entirely. Their cover of Londonbeat&#8217;s ?I&#8217;ve Been Thinking About You? strips the original of all its tack to become a song of absolute affirmation, while ?Heart It Races? commands those three words from almost every throat. With Boots being so liberally handed out all weekend, I&#8217;m amazed they don&#8217;t get more. AiH have never bothered me too much &#8211; in fact, they&#8217;ve pretty much passed me by &#8211; but tonight I became a raving fan.</p>

<p>?Buy our merch,? is the first thing <strong>Hawkwind</strong> lead singer David St Hubbins says before his band even plays a note. The band introduces every song in the style of a mystical rock opera, with two young women dancing, scantily clad and for no decipherable purpose, around the group of lascivious old men. What&#8217;s wrong with being sexy? Lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel makes the odd decision of a keytar solo, emphasised in a single spotlight while bass player Derek Smalls and the band&#8217;s newest drummer moves aside to give him the moment. Deciding the inside of my eyelids are more relevant, my boyfriend narrates the rest of the set for me. ?The dancing girls are wearing masks,? he says, before leaning back down a few moments later to add: ??and they&#8217;re doing robotics.? Of course they are. For the most part the set is lame but does no harm, until St Hubbins decides to intro a song by speaking, in the same Druids-style tone, about the horrors occurring in Japan. ?A mighty waaaaaaaave??? You fucking cunt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <strong>World&#8217;s End Press</strong> bring it all back. It&#8217;s an exultant, powerful set, and the crowd singalong on ?Faithful? can be heard back in the campsites. Fatigue&#8217;s setting in quickly for so many, and it&#8217;s a shame their set sees a smaller crowd than many others throughout the day, but they&#8217;ve got in the palm of their hands the most appreciative and excitable group of people remaining. More boots are held up high by those with the energy to do so, and it&#8217;s a fitting end to the bands.</p>
<p>As the DJs begin and many emigrate to the Pink Flamingo, my inflatable camp bed calls to me from the end of the road named Happy Endings. The moths are gone, but the joy remains.</p>
