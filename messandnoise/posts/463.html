                <h3>Australia&#8217;s independent music community pays tribute to Sound&amp;Fury founder and longtime ?M+N? contributor Adam D Mills, who passed away on May 31. Compiled by <strong>ANWYN CRAWFORD<em>* and *</em>SHAUN PRESCOTT</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3011814/440x355-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
With the death of Adam D Mills &#8211; ?the D is for danger?, he once joked &#8211; on May 31, <em>Mess+Noise* has lost one of our own. The impact has been immediate, and enormous, and devastating. So many people here knew Adam personally, professionally, virtually, that barely a person has gone unaffected by his passing. Adam was a long-time writer for *M+N</em>, a prolific contributor to the message boards, the impresario behind a much-loved independent label &#8211; and that&#8217;s just to begin listing his contributions to a musical community that he helped to bring alive.</p>
<p>Adam was born on August 21, 1980, in south-west Sydney, near Campbelltown, and it was the Sydney music community to which he first and most lastingly dedicated himself. He began working at Utopia Records, then on George Street, during 2003. Utopia is a metal specialist, and metal would continue to be a musical love of Adam&#8217;s, but his appetite for new music from across all genres was voracious, and he eventually took on the huge task of opening his own store. </p>
<p>Adam&#8217;s record store, Sound&amp;Fury, opened in early 2005. He named it after the saddest soliloquy in <em>Macbeth*: literature mattered as much to Adam as music did. Although it proved to be short-lived, the store, situated at the Oxford Street end of Bourke Street, Surry Hills, acted as both a breeding ground and stalwart support for Sydney&#8217;s otherwise well-hidden community of underground musicians. In an early advertisement which Adam took out in Sydney street press *The Drum Media</em>, he admitted that Sound&amp;Fury stocked (then in-vogue) Scottish indie darlings Franz Ferdinand, but that this was a concession to get people through the doors. Exposing ears to new sounds was Sound&amp;Fury&#8217;s real agenda and Adam pursued it without compromise, with a large section of the store devoted to local and international private press labels specialising in everything from folk music to noise. Adam also hosted regular in-store shows &#8211; on the provision that even his favourite noise bands keep the volume discreet, to avoid unwelcome police attention. Most people would express amazement and gratitude at Sound&amp;Fury&#8217;s audacity, before admitting that it probably wouldn&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>Which it didn&#8217;t: mid-2006 saw its demise. Adam announced in a Sound&amp;Fury mail-out that &#8220;the reasons behind this are many and complex: terrorism, bird flu, the wheat scandal, oil prices, big brother, Gnarls Barkley. Or, to put it another way: we&#8217;re broke.&#8221; After a short tenure at Dymocks, Adam began working at Red Eye Records, which by then was just about the last independent record store in Sydney left standing. Before he arrived, Red Eye&#8217;s experimental section was an almost bare shelf of dead stock. When Adam arrived and took charge of the section, beginning with a good amount of leftover stock from Sound&amp;Fury, Red Eye became the better for it.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with all these jobs, Adam was also running Sound&amp;Fury as a record label, and working as a music critic. The first two CD-Rs featured live in-store recordings of performances at Sound&amp;Fury by Castings and Yellow Swans respectively, both of which were released shortly before the shop&#8217;s closure. The label became even more active after the store&#8217;s demise, going on to release <a href="http://www.soundandfury.net.au/releases.html">25 CDs and CD-Rs in total</a> including works by Onani, Blarke Bayer, Scissor Lock and more. Adam&#8217;s writing also began to feature more frequently in <em>The Drum Media</em> after the shop&#8217;s closure, and in July 2007, Adam&#8217;s first contributions to Mess+Noise appeared.</p>
<p>His <a href="/articles/1283390">profile</a> of Sydney bedroom-pop trio Soft Tigers appeared in the magazine&#8217;s penultimate issue, along with his review of Moonmilk&#8217;s <em>The Winter Sun Has Teeth*, which he described as &#8220;shimmering plateaus of ambient drone&#8221;. Issue 15, the final print edition of *M+N</em>, featured several examples of his work, including album reviews, a <a href="/articles/1335595">feature article</a> on Guns Are For Kids and an ?On Play? column dealing with the slew of Australian post-punk retrospectives being issued at the time. Adam continued to contribute regularly when the magazine moved permanently online. Adam&#8217;s writing celebrated sound for its own sake: his was a refreshingly straightforward approach to criticism, often infused with a deadpan humour and determinedly above fads and reductive crit-speak. Adam was always on point.</p>
<p>Adam followed his dream of abandoning the city in 2008, beginning a new life in the small NSW town of Nimmitabel with his partner, Penelope Joy. Along with a larger beard and an ark load of pets, the move saw an upswing in activity from Sound&amp;Fury. What followed were a series of CD-Rs, a compilation entitled <em>Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow*, and a new black metal imprint called Foul is Fair (which spawned his last release, Bleakwood&#8217;s *Blood &amp; Faith</em>). Adam also set in motion a Sound&amp;Fury subscriber series called ?Passeridae?, with no less an aim than to unite the best Australian experimental musicians with their foreign counterparts across a dozen split-7? records. Sadly, only two physical releases were completed. More recently, Adam was living in Cooma, in the Snowy Mountains, and dreaming of becoming a National Park ranger.</p>
<p>The past week has brought many tears, deep shock, a storm of emotions &#8211; so many of us are grieving. But it has also brought stories, memories and tributes to Adam in great number: a genuine outpouring of love and respect for the man. If anything positive can be said to have come in the awful wake of Adam&#8217;s death, it&#8217;s in knowing that this community to which he was so central really is a community: it exists, and Adam was one person who, without doubt, brought it into being. And now we have to find a way to carry on without him. It won&#8217;t be the same, but we can only try to be worthy of his legacy.  </p>
<p>Gathered below are a number of tributes to Adam from friends and colleagues who worked alongside him in some of the numerous projects that he was a part of. These are individual reflections, but they add up to give us at least some sense of Adam&#8217;s life, a life worth celebrating and honouring.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Cameron Webb</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Seaworthy</b></p>
<p>I first met Adam not long after the opening of the Sound&amp;Fury store. He&#8217;d been kind enough to get in touch and ask if he could stock some Seaworthy releases and, to be honest, I was initially kind of suspicious. Who wants to open a store selling this kind of stuff? Walking into that store for the first time was mind-blowing. The range of music was incredible, particularly all the Australian and New Zealand experimental drone/noise CD-Rs. Would there have been another store in the world at the time where you could have walked out with half a dozen Celebrate Psi Phenomenon CD-Rs?</p>
<p>Adam immediately came across as friendly, knowledgeable and passionate. It was probably only minutes into our first meeting that he&#8217;d pulled down a limited edition hand-made Tarentel release and was enthusiastically extolling the virtues of the packaging and music alike. He was incredibly generous in his desire to share the music he loved, and it become quite clear that the store was about providing an opportunity to share all this amazing music with Sydney. Even in those last few days of chaos before the store closed, Adam was still pulling down records from the shelf behind the desk to show me. I should have bought that My Cat is An Alien LP.</p>
<p>On reflection, the role Adam played with Sound&amp;Fury was pivotal in establishing a community of experimental sound artists and supporters &#8211; whether through stocking releases that no other store would generally touch, hosting in-stores for local and touring bands and promoting local shows. The legacy lives on today, with Adam and Sound&amp;Fury a common link between many local artists, many of whom started out by attending those in-stores.</p>
<p>As far as his professional work with the label goes, the collection of a dozen or more CD-R releases that sit comfortably together on my shelf will be a constant reminder of his dedication to sharing music and supporting artists. Each carefully folded card package with its wax seal and individually typed inner sleeve and photos represented a slice of Adam&#8217;s life, his passion, his creativity and his generosity. I feel privileged to have been part of this series.  </p>
<p>One of my favourite memories of Adam will be of him at a Grouper show in Sydney a few years back. His excitement at getting to finally see Liz Harris play live was obvious and pretty infectious. This infectious passion for music never waned in the time I knew him, despite the fact that this passion for, and ambition to release, music caused numerous headaches and setbacks over the years. You&#8217;d forgive anyone for giving up but Adam kept plugging away. We&#8217;d been chatting pretty regularly over the past few months about future releases with Sound&amp;Fury including the Seaworthy/Tarentel split 7? in the ?Passeridae? series and a reissue of an earlier Seaworthy CD-R. He never suffered from a shortage of ideas. </p>
<p>Last time I saw him was a chilly afternoon in a Canberra cafe last year. I thought of it as perfect ?Adam weather?. He was happy and almost as enthused about life in the country as he was about the latest Sound&amp;Fury project. I had only seen him a handful of times since he moved out of the city but I was never greeted by anything other than a warm smile. I don&#8217;t think we ever had a disagreement but he did express some disappointment when I shaved off my beard.<br/>
I&#8217;ll certainly miss him and have no doubt we&#8217;re all a little worse off for his tragic passing.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Shoeb Ahmad</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Spartak</b></p>
<p>Adam was a great dude to be around. Seeing the energy he put into his store and label motivated me to make my own label hellosQuare into something more than it was. It upsets me that I won&#8217;t have the chance to tell him how inspiring he was.</p>
<p>Sound&amp;Fury helped me get through a year of living away from home, and gave me my first opportunity to talk to someone else about the things I was interested in musically. I&#8217;m sure I bugged him a little bit at that time, but he was kind enough to let me loiter around the shop for whole afternoons. </p>
<p>We&#8217;d often slip in and out of touch with each other, but whenever I wondered about how he and his partner Pene were going, I would get an email from him with an update on life in the country. </p>
<p>The last two times I saw Adam are entangled with two very important memories in my life. The first is when Evan Dorrian and I drove out to make the Spartak record <em>Verona</em>. We stopped at Adam&#8217;s house in Nimmitabel on our way to the coast. He and Pene had recently acquired some new pets and a farm animal or two, and we watched their cat eat through a block of parmesan cheese that was sitting on the kitchen top. I spent a whole afternoon in his company and enjoyed hearing about how much he and Pene loved living there, and how Sydney had bored him so much. I think he also mentioned how he thought The Triffids were overrated after he saw them support Leonard Cohen at a ?Day On The Green?.</p>
<p>The other memory is of my wedding reception in Canberra in March. I was very keen on making sure that he and Pene came up for the reception and bugged him like crazy. Sure enough they were there, and it meant a lot to me as I knew he liked to spend a lot of time at home. They had a great time and Adam got to catch up with a few musician types from Sydney. He also looked quite sharp. I would&#8217;ve been happy for him to come in his customary jeans and a hoodie, but to see him in a slightly formal outfit made me realise that our friendship had gone beyond just music. Also, a lot of my relatives kept asking me if he was an ?Australian? friend who had converted to Islam. They were quite impressed with the size of his beard.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Laura Imbruglia</h2>
<p><b>Musician; Co-worker, Utopia Records</b></p>
<p>Adam and I worked together at Utopia Records on George St before he left to open Sound&amp;Fury. I guess it was probably around 2003 when I met him. I remember when he started working, I found him very hard to pigeonhole as a music fan. Here is this lovely quiet guy walking around in a Radiohead T-shirt, fawning over Tori Amos bootlegs, and getting excited about the Mayhem show he&#8217;s about to see where they&#8217;ll have REAL pigs&#8217; heads on stakes!</p>
<p>He always had gorgeous girls coming in to visit him and dorky old avant-garde music fans chewing his ear off about whatever their latest discovery was. Adam would happily oblige them. For my 21st birthday Adam and his then-girlfriend Laura gave me a Siamese fighter fish to go with another one I already had. I told him I was having trouble naming it, as the other one was ugly (I named it ?Mong?) and this one was so beautiful. He suggested I call it ?Itchycoo? after the lyric, &#8220;It&#8217;s all too beautiful&#8221;, from The Small Faces&#8217; ?Itchycoo Park?. So I did.</p>
<p>Adam would always be drumming along with his hands on his torso to music he liked. I remember him borrowing a drum-kit from Eli of Stockholm Syndrome (one of his favourite Sydney bands at the time). He really wanted to learn the drums and I wonder if he ever did.</p>
<p>Being a fellow disgruntled Utopia staff member, Adam was super-excited to be opening his very own store, which he set up exactly as he wanted it. I went to the launch show for Sound&amp;Fury, which was held at Excelsior in Surry Hills. I think Stockholm Syndrome and Nunchukka Superfly played. Adam and Laura (who co-ran the store with him) dutifully stood at the merch desk all night grinning from ear to ear. Adam put his all into the store and made sure he was always getting great, interesting acts to do in-store shows. I was really sad to receive an email from him one day telling me that they&#8217;d run out of money and the store was closing down. </p>
<p>After Sound&amp;Fury&#8217;s close, Adam worked at Dymocks for a while and I would occasionally go to visit him. He told me he didn&#8217;t want anything to do with music ever again. I didn&#8217;t believe him. I recommended that Red Eye hire him as a suitable replacement for Oren Ambarchi (their resident avant-garde freak who had stopped working there recently) and soon enough, they did. It was there that Adam met Pene, his future girlfriend.</p>
<p>After a while, Adam and Pene moved out to the bush and I kind of lost touch with him. I ran into him at a show once and was really glad to see him. As always, he had a self-made bootleg of someone&#8217;s band in his hand ready to give to a buddy he was expecting to see. </p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Craig Mathieson</h2>
<p><b>Former editor, <em>Mess+Noise</em></b></p>
<p>I was Adam&#8217;s first editor at <em>Mess+Noise</em>. He emailed me, out of the blue, to suggest that he start contributing and that he could do good work. Like the copy that followed it was to the point, articulate about the matter at hand and quite correct. He was a pleasure to edit: you read it, fussed around the edges for no real reason, and sent it onwards. </p>
<p>There are numerous good writers and many people with truly detailed music knowledge, but it&#8217;s rare to combine the two. Adam was both. In certain ways Adam summed up what we had hoped for with <em>Mess+Noise</em>. He reviewed and he posted; he was a critic and he was an advocate. He shared his life on the threads, firstly about music and then many other topics &#8211; like a lot of people I automatically opened every thread he started. He could be quick to correct online errors &#8211; he had standards &#8211; but he also made people laugh. I think he liked to make converts, or at least redeem the disbelievers. He convinced me to reconsider Nine Inch Nails with the last album and he was right. We swapped emails a while back, after his last residential move, and he assured me that whatever he did next, he planned to keep on writing about music.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Mark Nielsen</h2>
<p><b>Editor, <em>The Drum Media</em></b></p>
<p>The thing that radiated most for me about Adam was his passion for music, and I know I am not alone in this thought. He would always give an honest opinion and, especially when he was writing about something he loved, you got the feeling that his writing would take you to whatever place he went to himself when he listened to the music. Such is the talent of a great writer, which is what Adam was, and I am glad so many of his pieces appeared in <em>The Drum Media</em>. Adam may no longer be with us, but his words will live on.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Anna Vo</h2>
<p><b>Musician</b></p>
<p>Adam was my friend. My incredible, sweet, soft, honest, warm, idealistic friend. He believed in love, and fate, and forevers. He was always surprised at his own ability and capacity, but had no reason to be, because he was limitless. When most people would stop trying or caring after the blows he was dealt, he remained compelled by his faith and enthusiasm for beautiful and valuable cultural artefacts. He wanted to share with everyone else what he could see: in music, film, and print.  </p>
<p>My favourite recollection at this moment is Adam showing me his multiple copies of each <em>McSweeney&#8217;s Quarterly</em>: different presses, different versions, different colours on the cover jackets &#8211; &#8220;You see here?&#8221; He also taught me never, ever to crack the spine of a soft-cover book. I see him every time I look at my bookshelf, and associate with him almost every song I listen to.</p>
<p>We bonded over a scarily parallel taste in music, and also, similar ambitions. One thing we did was start a two-piece doom band &#8211; he was a great drummer, conflicted by shyness. He had no idea how much the world would appreciate him if he had just kept going.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Marcus Whale</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Scissor Lock</b></p>
<p>I have never met anyone as passionate about music as Adam. I don&#8217;t think I ever will. It&#8217;s obvious in his writing, but that doesn&#8217;t quite match the obsessive, emotional commitment Adam made to the Sound&amp;Fury label and its short-lived store. Several times, Adam tried to cut down his output, but it was this passion that overcame him when he came out with yet another spate of releases, sometimes beyond his financial means. I was first exposed to him via the Surry Hills store. I didn&#8217;t know him then. He stocked an incredible release by Seaworthy called <em>Needle vs Thread</em>, packaged in a handmade bag which was limited to about 20 copies. I was in a remote part of Sydney on a Sunday and phoned in to see if any copies were left &#8211; there was one. I hurried off and arrived just as Adam was locking up. Of course, I was too intimidated by his beard to knock on the door.</p>
<p>The Sound&amp;Fury label was, in my opinion, the best expression of who Adam was. From the first I heard of the CD-Rs I was hooked on the series. I remember grabbing my first goodie bag of releases &#8211; Onani, Shoeb Ahmad and All Bears &#8211; from him in the upstairs section of Red Eye. I have around seven of the wax sealed CD-Rs in my CD drawer and they remain the most beautiful objects there. In 2007, I sent him a whole bunch of music of mine, which until then had pretty much been kept in my bedroom. He was the first person to put enough faith in my music to slave for hours over a hand-made CD-R of mine, <em>Thawing Voices</em>, in August 2008. I was completely elated &#8211; it was one of the first times anyone had truly invested themselves in my music. Because of this, I&#8217;d say Sound&amp;Fury is responsible for why I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m doing now. And I&#8217;m certain there are many other stories like mine, of music that, without Adam&#8217;s passion, would have stayed isolated and unheard. We owe so much to you, Adam. I will miss you terribly.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Peter Hollo</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Raven/FourPlay; Presenter, FBi</b></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I was close to Adam as a friend, but I had many connections to him &#8211; as a broadcaster and a musician, a music fan, and a &#8220;chat&#8221; on the <em>Mess+Noise</em> forums. My first memory of him dates from when he started Sound&amp;Fury on Bourke Street: an incredibly audacious idea that couldn&#8217;t quite find the support it needed in Sydney. That the Popfrenzy kids&#8217; Gifted shop closed around the same time as Sound&amp;Fury is testament to the fact that it was not for Adam&#8217;s want of trying, and the many in-stores held and the cornucopia of unusual music stocked there will be dearly held in people&#8217;s memories for ages to come.</p>
<p>I got to know him better as he started releasing more music under the Sound&amp;Fury label. When he announced the ?Passeridae? series and the <em>Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow</em> compilation (Volume 1! Oh, Adam&#8230;), I dared to send off an email asking if he&#8217;d consider my music, attaching some very old and crap recordings of processed cello. He was immediately interested, and there&#8217;s no doubt that without his openness I would not have found the self-motivation to start making solo music again. The track I wrote for Passeridae (?Cold Afternoon?) has a kind of quietude that&#8217;s open to emotional interpretation, and I know I won&#8217;t be able to listen to it (or perhaps perform it) without tears again.</p>
<p>Even if Sound&amp;Fury&#8217;s ambitions were greater than its achievements, there&#8217;s an incredible legacy there, mostly wrapped in lovely envelopes with Sound&amp;Fury wax seals. The loss of Adam, felt whenever I look at my Sound&amp;Fury tote bag, listen to all this music, or see his threads bumped on the <em>M+N</em> board, is a great one for the Australian music community as a whole, and for many, many musicians, bands and fans.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Chris Hearn</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Alps</b></p>
<p>My first recollection of Adam is of seeing him at a Sydney warehouse called Iraq. My punk band Bene Gesserit had released a hand-made CD-R split with another Sydney punk band, Brand Disloyalty, that we were selling for donations. Adam bought the whole pile of them to put in his shop, which was to open in a few weeks. </p>
<p>A couple months later I had put out the Alps demo and sent Adam a few copies. He sold one to Nick Senger from Castings, who I had seen play a bunch of times but never talked to. I guess Adam gave him my number too, as Senger texted me to tell me all about it, and thus began a number of lasting friendships. I went to a few shows at Sound&amp;Fury and played at a few. Adam put me on bills with other people who were also playing electronic and experimental music: having come from the punk/underground indie scene myself, up until then all the early Alps shows were with guitar bands like Kiosk, French Horns and My Disco.</p>
<p>Sometime during 2005, I recorded the first Alps LP, and announced via a MySpace bulletin that I&#8217;d be putting out the CD soon myself, and there wouldn&#8217;t be any vinyl pressing unless anyone else put up their hand to do it. I got a message back from Adam, coolly offering to press the LP. I was ecstatic: it was my first appearance on record, and this had been a lifelong dream. I had been pretty down in the dumps and not sure if the music was even any good, but Adam made everything turn around very quickly. I know a lot of people who had similar experiences with Adam. He believed in us, in what we were doing, that it was important and worth documenting, sharing and remembering. He continued to put his entire life into making this happen for people like me, my friends, people who would later become my friends, and bands I hadn&#8217;t heard of that I am still listening to today. Adam was a man who lived for his passion, fought for it, kept getting up when he was knocked down. We should be taking his cues.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Eliza Sarlos</h2>
<p><b>Radio presenter, FBi; Contributor, <em>Mess+Noise</em></b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling to find the words that, from me, would be fitting for Adam. I think I first met him when I awkwardly fumbled my way through the heavenly Sound&amp;Fury, a record store I still can&#8217;t quite believe managed to exist in Sydney. As the years progressed I would read anything with a byline of Adam D Mills, knowing that &#8211; irrespective of the topic &#8211; whatever would be said was worth reading. It&#8217;s rare you find those people who you can rely on, in any sense, and over the years ADM never did disappoint. His passion and intelligence for music was something I looked forward to, something that invigorated my mind and ears, and something I felt privileged to have access to. And I know it wasn&#8217;t just <em>my</em> mind and ears &#8211; the impact Adam had on the music community in Australia was edifying, and the work he did with S&amp;F when it turned from store to label has facilitated the development of so much music that, in Australia, wouldn&#8217;t have been heard but for Adam. </p>
<p>His contribution to this community will keep growing as the work of those he supported continues to shape the Australian musical landscape, for which we are all the better for. I feel sad to know that Adam won&#8217;t be here to witness it, and with that same sadness, and with love, and admiration, I say a reluctant goodbye to this incredible soul.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Anwyn Crawford</h2>
<p><b>Writer, <em>Cyclic Defrost*; Former contributor, *Mess+Noise</em></b></p>
<p>Adam was the only man I&#8217;ve ever met &#8211; perhaps the only man I&#8217;ll ever meet &#8211; who could wear both nail polish and a beard at the same time. He took great pride in cultivating his mid-western Americana country-rock beard, and his nail polish of choice was generally black, and a little chipped at the edges. He was also the only man &#8211; scratch that, the only <em>person</em> &#8211; I&#8217;ve ever met who loved Pearl Jam and Yellow Swans equally. But that&#8217;s how Adam was: a man whose passions were both disparate and seemingly inexhaustible.</p>
<p>I associate the four or five years during which I knew Adam with a rare high point in the perpetually fluctuating fortunes of the independent Sydney music community. But that&#8217;s no accident, because Adam helped to make that community &#8211; he was vital to it. Sound&amp;Fury might not have lasted as a store, but we had venues: Lanfranchi&#8217;s, Yvonne Ruve, The Pitz; we had musicians to play in them: Seaworthy, Castings, Moonmilk, a dozen others; we had <em>Mess+Noise</em> &#8211; which Adam and I both wrote for &#8211; to cover the shows and the releases, and we had Adam&#8217;s record label putting out those releases. And we had Adam.</p>
<p>One of Adam&#8217;s greatest talents &#8211; perhaps his greatest talent &#8211; was his ability to forge connections between people, particularly between musicians and listeners. He possessed two of the best qualities that a critic and a label-owner can: open-mindedness and generosity of spirit. It&#8217;s easy to become jaded and cynical in this industry, but I don&#8217;t believe Adam ever did. His enthusiasm was unbeatable, and he had no time for tastemakers. Adam didn&#8217;t care if an artist was obscure, obvious, or otherwise: if he thought the music was worthwhile he would champion it loyally. Not to mention the fact that he was a great writer. And he had a record label putting out beautiful CD-Rs in lovingly hand-assembled packaging, every one put together by Adam. How many of us can boast of half so much achieved? </p>
<p>Adam was shy &#8211; it could be hard to persuade him into attending a show, but when he did turn up it would inevitably be with a wide smile on his face underneath that beard, and a canvas tote bag full of his latest musical discoveries. I remember being particularly chuffed at getting him to come along to a show I had organised at the Hopetoun in 2007, where one of his favourite Sydney bands &#8211; Rand &amp; Holland &#8211; were playing.</p>
<p>I last saw Adam in person around mid-2008, not long before we both moved away from Sydney: I to New York and he to Nimmitabel. We shared lunch at my house. I waved him goodbye at the bus stop. He was wearing his beard, and his nail polish. The last email exchange we had was just three weeks ago. <em>Simpsons</em> jokes. Detailed descriptions of feeding his pet snake, Persephone. Those self-deprecating late-night email exchanges when we were both on deadline and furiously procrastinating from our work. Mix tapes and CD-Rs he gave me. The times we&#8217;d get ourselves worked up to a great pitch of expectation before a Bluebottle Kiss show, practically laying bets on the set list. Beautiful man, you cannot be replaced.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Andrew Tuttle</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Anonymeye</b></p>
<p>I was first introduced to Adam in early 2007 via email. At that point I was aware of the shop and label, however I never ended up making it to Sydney when the store was around. A mutual friend of ours had put us in contact, and with Adam as always keen to hear new music he suggested that I should send something to him. I did, and he wrote back almost immediately offering to put something out on Sound&amp;Fury, which was so exciting for me &#8211; the first time anyone had wanted to release more than a compilation track of mine, and at a time when I was feeling a bit directionless in terms of making music. </p>
<p>Adam ended up putting out a few Anonymeye releases (an album, two 3? CD-Rs and a track on a compilation) on Sound&amp;Fury between 2007 and 2009. In each case I was drawn to his openness, creative instinct and aesthetic. Having someone so passionate about music be interested in what I was doing inspired me creatively.</p>
<p>The only time we met in person was at All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties at Mt Buller last year. It was a brief hello between sets and we made plans to catch up, however they got lost in the weekend, as did so many other plans. In our brief meeting his genuineness was apparent, and it further reconfirmed my happiness with releasing music on Sound&amp;Fury.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d always admired Adam&#8217;s various schemes, plans and aims for world domination. Even though his plans didn&#8217;t always turn out as anticipated, it was still inspiring to work with a dreamer. Creatively, I&#8217;d rather a dreamer than a pragmatist, any day. I&#8217;ll miss him heaps.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Shaun Prescott</h2>
<p><b>Contributor, <em>Mess+Noise/Cyclic Defrost</em></b></p>
<p>Sound&amp;Fury advertised their stock replenishments in <em>Drum Media</em> every now and again. Having moved to Sydney in 2005, I was intrigued by some of the ridiculous names that would crop up. Ashtray Navigations, Starving Weirdos and Wolf Eyes? Fuck Pete Larsen are a few examples. So one afternoon I trekked to the eastern suburbs, resigned to the fact that I&#8217;d spend a lot of my savings. I bought a Swans album and a Lightning Bolt album, as well as Nora Keyes? only album. Adam asked me whether I&#8217;d heard Swans before, and I thought it was a trick. It wasn&#8217;t &#8211; he just wanted to have a chat about what I&#8217;d soon learn was one of our mutual favourite bands. And so we did, and it was nice. Adam wasn&#8217;t a snob.</p>
<p>It was Adam&#8217;s store that put me onto some of my favourite bands: Castings, Seaworthy, Moonmilk, Alps and countless other weird local bands I&#8217;d never read about in the street press. Music communities need people like Adam to attract and recruit people like me, and Adam was indirectly responsible for cultivating the obsessions that have since come to dominate my album collection and much of my writing.</p>
<p>I was quite intimidated by him then, and desperately wanted to be his friend. Thankfully we did eventually become friends, though I would liked to have been closer, as we all do with people we admire. He was calm, and nodded when you spoke with him. He was very good at eye contact. He was unapologetic about his tastes, and generous with his passion: it invariably involved people on a community level. It was something to be shared, and something he instinctively remained involved with, even after his efforts to make a living off it proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>When Michael Gira of Swans toured Australia early last year, I received an email in my inbox with the subject heading ?MICHAEL FUCKING GIRA?. It was Adam, wanting to share a conniption fit about one of our mutual favourite bands. That email trail is very, very long.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Mark Leacy</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Spanish Magic/Castings</b></p>
<p>Adam was a man who had a rare, uncompromising willingness to support the music that he loved &#8211; and he expected nothing in return! Sound No Sound, Castings, Spanish Magic, Yvonne Ruve are forever grateful for the support he showed us in the five years we had the pleasure of knowing him. Thank you Adam for opening a great record store and putting on shows. Thank you for putting out a Castings record when no one else gave a shit and also for being an all round great fellow with such kind words to say.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Lia Tsamaglou</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Moonmilk/Melodie Nelson</b></p>
<p>All of my visual memories of Adam are of his huge smile and sparkly eyes. He was a sweet, gentle human, who I was always excited to see. He was passionate about music but he also had an impressive collection of first edition novels and <em>Simpsons</em> DVD box sets.</p>
<p>Adam stocked our very first Moonmilk tapes. These were home-dubbed, with hand-painted butterfly covers that were quite pretty to look at. I&#8217;m fairly sure we made seven copies, and Adam bought one of them. He later recounted a story to us, of a Japanese girl who came into Sound&amp;Fury store and pointed at our tape, and so assuming she wanted to buy one, Adam showed her the cassette inside. She looked astonished and almost upset and replied &#8220;I cannot play this!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember once while I was working at Sound&amp;Fury with Adam, he told me that he had an impressive collection of <em>Wire</em> magazines and that years before the store opened, he had noted what releases he wanted to buy for the shop. He was such a nerd.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Kell Derrig-Hall</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Moonmilk/Tired Hands</b></p>
<p>Adam was a passionate and articulate advocate for adventurous and ambitious music. His friendship and support had a huge impact on my music and me. I know his presence was an inspiration to a lot of talented musicians who were not getting a lot of acknowledgement elsewhere. This was in that weird ?new rock? period. Oxford Street was still shaking with Strokes wannabes. Adam had the vision and the guts to open a store that saw beyond fashion and artifice in music. Looking back it was an incredibly brave move and one that says a lot about how selfless Adam was. </p>
<p>The shop invited people to share in their passion for music in a very personal way and it was an enormous breath of fresh air. It&#8217;s easy to forget that Sound&amp;Fury wasn&#8217;t a vanity project for Adam. He put himself on the line to release recordings that he knew deserved to be heard. He was genuinely excited about the music that was happening around him and worked really hard to put Australian experimental music on a global stage. Adam&#8217;s contribution to the underground scene in Australia and particularly in Sydney should not be underestimated. It was massive. He encouraged all kinds of people, cliques, and collectives to give their art the attention it deserved.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Darren Levin and Danny Bos</h2>
<p><b>Co-editors, <em>Mess+Noise</em></b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to put into words your feelings for someone you&#8217;ve never met in person, and yet one could absolutely get a sense of Adam&#8217;s personality and passion from the words he contributed to <em>Mess+Noise</em>. Adam was a brave and articulate writer, an incisive interviewer and a consummate professional. Sometimes his inability to mince words caused a few headaches &#8211;  a less than glowing review of a Firekites record caused a long-running ?cold war? with their label &#8211; but he was that rare kind of writer you&#8217;d back without reservation. We&#8217;ll certainly miss sending out those weird 7?s &#8211; the ones no one else wanted to review &#8211; to a magical, faraway place called Nimmitabel.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Ben Andrews</h2>
<p><b>Musician, Blarke Bayer/My Disco</b></p>
<p>I knew Adam, as many did, through his work at Sound&amp;Fury records. It seems like forever ago now that this store existed, but I remember walking in and meeting him back in 2005, I guess it was. I instantly fell in love with the place! It was like no other record store in the country. Instead, it reminded me of what I love about those big city American record stores: it had an intimate space for concerts, listening booths (with good quality headphones!) mounted on the walls, a larger than usual amount of experimental records, and it was in a part of Sydney that I&#8217;ve always loved, with decent coffee right next door. </p>
<p>Adam came across as a shy and down to earth guy, and we struck up a friendship over the years. He helped me out with the Yellow Swans shows in Sydney &#8211; a particular favorite of mine was the Sound&amp;Fury in-store where 30 or so people sat around while the band did a mellow set, so as to not kill his reputation with the neighbours. One of my favorite solo releases is the <em>Meniere&#8217;s Disease</em> CD-R he did for me. With little effort from my part, he put in a lot of work, great attention to detail and an obvious love for the music and art of self-releasing small run, outsider music. </p>
<p>The last time I saw Adam was at ATP on Mt Buller. We both had just seen Micheal Gira play and were blown away. A few weeks later, he sent me a recording of Gira&#8217;s sideshow at The Basement, instinctively knowing that I&#8217;d really appreciate it. It sounded perfect. It&#8217;s this kind of passion and dedication to community that will be greatly missed with his passing. Goodnight brother.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Jon Tjhia</h2>
<p><b>Musician, ii/Aleks and The Ramps</b></p>
<p>I met Adam D Mills over the counter at Sound&amp;Fury when he was an enthusiastic, clean-shaven guy who had freshly founded a record store and label, both boutique &#8211; the teenage dream of any noise nerd or music fanatic. Those were his passions, and he put everything on the line for them: his reputation, his every penny, his sanity.  People don&#8217;t forget that stuff. </p>
<p>Adam was a sweet guy, insightful and keen to boot. I met his beard over drinks one afternoon when he visited Melbourne. He was always talking about his new ideas, or ideas generally. I remember when a phone interview with my bandmate Alex and I turned into a long, tangential conversation about the fundamental assumptions of personality in improvised music; a rambling discussion about the insights pop could provide to experimentalism, as Al and I passed the phone to and fro. Adam was always much more interested than a music journalist typically is. He didn&#8217;t have the same filter a lot of people do, and he had the knowledge that a lot of people don&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>He later invited us to be a part of his label&#8217;s ?Passeridae? project, which he saw as a way of linking Australia&#8217;s underground to the broader experimental scene beyond our shores. It would have been great had the resources been there, and the customers been as forthcoming as the artists. The same could be said of his store, around which much of Australia&#8217;s noise and experimental music gathered during its short life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll remember him most for his gregariousness, patience and perseverance; for his belief in sharing the value of whatever he felt was valuable. I&#8217;ll miss his unstoppable initiative and his deep knowledge. He contributed a great deal to us, whoever &#8220;we&#8221; are.  I hope Audrey Sylvain is singing him to sleep.</p>
