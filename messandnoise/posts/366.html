                <h3>Not content to rest on their Australian Music Prize-winning laurels, The Mess Hall continue to push the limits of the two-piece format on new album &#8216;For The Birds&#8217;, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>

After releasing the AMP-winning <em>Devils Elbow</em> in 2007, The Mess Hall &#8211; singer/guitarist Jed Kurzel and drummer Cec Condon &#8211; began purging themselves of the influences that inspired its creation. </p>
<p>?I don&#8217;t think we had it in us to make [another] rock record,? confesses Kurzel down the phone from the band&#8217;s home base of Sydney. ?We didn&#8217;t want to repeat <em>Devils</em> and I guess our tastes in music kinda changed as well.?</p>
<p>The duo spent three years filling themselves up with new source material &#8211; from the novels of New York author Paul Auster to the obscure gems spun by Bob Dylan and The Cramps? Lux Interior on their respective radio shows. The result is <em>For The Birds*, their most expansive and creatively ambitious outing to date; a reverb-drenched and often claustrophobic listen, punctuated by driving piano and packed with Lynchian references and surrealist imagery. Recorded at BJB Studios in Sydney with producer Burke Reid (who worked with the band on *Devils</em>), it was created spontaneously in the studio without any pre-recorded demos to fall back on. And it&#8217;s this devil-may-care approach to life in the studio, says Kurzel, that continues to keeps things fresh.</p>
<p>?I don&#8217;t ever want to be bored by playing music and I&#8217;d stop if it ever got like that; if it was just part of some sort of machine,? he explains. ?There&#8217;d be no point going into the studio and fucking about with songs that you&#8217;d been demoing for the past year or something like that.?</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the feeling like before an album comes out?</strong><br/>
I guess, really good. I haven&#8217;t really listened to it that much [<em>laughs*] and I&#8217;m kinda getting my head around playing them [the new songs] now. The other day, for about the first time in two years, I listened to our last record, *Devils Elbow</em>, and finally heard it with foreign ears without all the images of being in the studio. I thought it was really good. I guess I&#8217;ll only be able to say how I feel about this one in a couple years. </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s quite a departure from your last record. Are there any apprehensions about how it&#8217;ll be received?</strong><br/>
Not really. You go one way you can&#8217;t win; you go another way you can&#8217;t win. If people don&#8217;t want a departure, it&#8217;s up to them.</p>
<p><strong>What are the genesis of these songs?</strong><br/>
We used a lot of the AMP [Australian Music Prize] money to hire out a rehearsal space that we could use day in, day out, and go in at our leisure. We never sat down and thought, ?Let&#8217;s make an album.? We just played a few days a week and recorded everything &#8211; The way we do things now is we play play play; gather up a pile of stuff; and by the time we decide to make a record, some of it might be finished, some might not, some might not even exist; and then we go into the studio and let it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Did you cull a lot of songs from the initial batch?</strong><br/>
Yeah, there were a few that we thought were going to make it and then when we started recording them, they didn&#8217;t feel right or they didn&#8217;t stack up against something else. I guess as we worked through it, we tailored them to fit a particular world.</p>
<p><strong>Have you guys been working on this for the past three years since the last album. Or have you taken a bit of time off?</strong><br/>
We took a bit of time off, but I guess I call working on it listening to [other] music and reading books. When you finish an album you empty yourself of all of that and you start filling yourself up with whatever you can find again. Hopefully, that filters through whatever Cec and I do.</p>
<p><strong>Were you listening to or reading anything in particular?</strong><br/>
I was reading a lot of Paul Auster, but I don&#8217;t know how much of an influence that had. Cec and I were listening a lot to Bob Dylan&#8217;s radio show [<em>Theme Time Radio Hour*]. What was great about that was he&#8217;d play something you&#8217;d never heard and then you could go off and look into it as much as you wanted &#8211; And then just before we went into the studio there was a compilation that Lux Interior had done of obscure rockabilly and big band stuff [*The Purple Knif Show*] &#8211; We just read things and listened to stuff and, rather than making any grand plans, we just thought, ?It&#8217;s all in the headbox. Hopefully something good will come out.? [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<blockquote><p>?We just read things and listened to stuff and, rather than making any grand plans, we just thought, &#8216;It&#8217;s all in the headbox. Hopefully something good will come out.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s fair to say you go into the studio with a fairly loose agenda?</strong><br/>
Yeah, absolutely. But we have ideas &#8211; although we never really talk about them in terms of music, it&#8217;s characters most of the time. With certain instruments, we&#8217;re always kind of saying, ?Oh, this guy&#8217;s gotta walk into the room now and no one wants him there.? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Burke&#8217;s role in the process? Is he a collaborator as well?</strong><br/>
Cec and I might sit in the room and play for a while and he [Burke] will be at the desk or moving microphones around and pulling different sounds. As we go along that will lead us into other areas. We&#8217;ll probably get the spark of an idea and then start following it. Sometimes that happens in the first hour we get in, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t happen until the last couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>He&#8217;s a real chameleon producer, isn&#8217;t he? I mean you just have to look at your album stacked up against stuff he&#8217;s done for bands like The Drones.</strong><br/>
Yeah, and he&#8217;s very good at pushing you further than what you&#8217;d normally do. If you&#8217;re being lazy, he&#8217;ll highlight that.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a really groove-based and reverb-drenched record.</strong><br/>
A lot of the kind of music we were listening to had reverb and tremolo and things like that. I guess those kind of things put something in its own world. I like records that really feel like they&#8217;re stuck in their own world.</p>
<p><strong>And you&#8217;ve brought some guest musicians on board for this record?</strong><br/>
No, it was pretty much Cec and I.</p>
<p><strong>What about the female vocals?</strong><br/>
Oh, sorry. I forgot about those! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Was that Loene Carmen [who sang on <em>Devils Elbow</em>] again?</strong><br/>
No, no. That was Cec&#8217;s girlfriend Anna Young. We wanted a female vocal on a couple songs [?Marlene? and ?My Villain?] and he said she could do it. Luckily, she was fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>And those piano overdubs?</strong><br/>
I did all of those &#8211; I just like the sound of low piano notes. It substitutes the bass in some ways, but I like the fact that they&#8217;re there, but not there at the same time. They create another mood and work really well with the reverb. I&#8217;ve never really been a piano player, so I kind of just sit there and bang away at it. We get what we get. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>The interesting thing about the album is that there are a lot of overdubs and a lot of things going on, but it&#8217;s quite sparse at the same time. Is it difficult to strike that balance?</strong><br/>
Yeah, definitely. I&#8217;m not into music where people are just throwing stuff at songs. You know, that song would&#8217;ve given me the exact same feeling if it didn&#8217;t have violins. If we do add something, it&#8217;d really have to serve a purpose. It&#8217;d have to be something interesting. It can&#8217;t just be a guitar lick or something like that, it has to be within the mood of the song.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3007966/440x320-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>On the flipside, I think most bands who head into the studio just want to get the best approximation of themselves live. Whereas The Mess Hall view it as a chance to experiment.</strong><br/>
The idea of demoing and re-recording songs never made sense to me. I can&#8217;t get my head around that. It seems like an idea that was set up by a music system in terms of a business idea: ?If I know how these songs are going to turn out, then I won&#8217;t lose my job.? [<em>Laughs</em>]. That for me doesn&#8217;t serve the music at all, and I don&#8217;t know how many demos I&#8217;ve heard that are better than the album. That&#8217;s because the birth of the idea was captured in the demo. Of course, it sounds better and has more energy. People were more excited playing it.</p>
<p><strong>In that sense, are you a one- or two-take kinda band?</strong><br/>
Pretty much, yeah. We&#8217;ll just kind of run through it, and once we feel like we&#8217;ve got it, we&#8217;ll just go for the takes.</p>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s obviously more about feel than perfection?</strong><br/>
Totally. That&#8217;s another thing Burke&#8217;s really talented at. He can walk into to a room and say, ?I really like that one.? He&#8217;s got a good feel.</p>
<p><strong>Given how much you experiment in the studio, would you ever consider expanding the two-piece format live?</strong><br/>
For the last few shows, we&#8217;ve had a third person on stage doing the piano parts. I don&#8217;t think being a two-piece and not having someone else is some sort of an important thing. It&#8217;s not a rule at all. If the song needs it, then it needs it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to change the dynamic of the show [<em>laughs</em>]. We could play these shows as a duo if we wanted to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Piano&#8217;s such an integral part of this record, though.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I guess. The piano thing is an interesting one &#8211; For a while there we were looking at buying a piano and hauling it up the stairs and having it sit in the studio for a while, so we could keep experimenting. But I don&#8217;t think we had the finances in the end [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m sure you get this question all the time, but do you find the two-piece format limiting?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t in the studio, because the limitations &#8211; I mean, they can be incredibly frustrating &#8211; but they also make for some interesting decisions. We don&#8217;t really have a rule like The White Stripes or something, where it&#8217;s gotta be this, or it&#8217;s gotta be that. That&#8217;s a bit kinda gimmicky I think. If the song needs something else, you put it on there and think about how to get around it later. If we need more people on stage, we need more people on stage.</p>
<p><strong>Is a full-scale album tour on the cards?</strong><br/>
I think we&#8217;ll go on an extended tour in February. </p>
<p><strong>After the album&#8217;s sunk in?</strong><br/>
Definitely, yeah.</p>
