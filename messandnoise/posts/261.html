                <h3>Despite a somewhat inglorious start, Kid Sam&#8217;s recent east-coast tour with McKisko and Fergus Brown ends up with an on-stage singalong about the female anatomy. <strong>KIERAN RYAN</strong> reports.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004742/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
One thing before we start: until now Kid Sam (my cousin Kishore Ryan and I) have been a strictly Melbourne-only band. We had never played outside Melbourne, let alone Victoria. I thought about this as I sat in Bon Amici Cafe, Toowoomba. We&#8217;d gone on tour for the first time: to play a few shows with McKisko from Brisbane and Fergus Brown from Sydney; all of us with debut albums just released, rotating the headlining spot depending on whose city it was. </p>
<p>Someone (I can&#8217;t remember who) had the idea of convoying out to Toowoomba in rural Queensland, a couple of days before the Brisbane gig. It&#8217;s a small uni town apparently and therefore easy to get a few bored students down to almost anything. The thing was, everyone thought someone else would take care of promotion, so the extent of it ended up being one poster up at Bon Amici with ?tonight? scrawled across it in texta. We soon realised that no-one was going to come. This was our first show outside of Melbourne. </p>
<p>Helen (McKisko) got up first and played a beautiful set. At one point a small CWA tour came in for coffee. The coffee machine grinded loudly over her wonderful voice. We got up and played next. A couple of teenagers who looked like they knew the sound guy wandered in and sat down. They stayed while Fergus Brown and band got up and played a great set. A drunk woman in her 60s, wearing a bright red trilby, came in and sat down next to me. As Fergus played she sang along loudly. Well done, Fergus, I thought. Fans in Towoomba know all the words to your songs.</p>
<p>?Excuse me,? I asked. ?You obviously know all of Fergus? lyrics pretty well. Have you been a fan of his long??<br/>
?I&#8217;ve never heard them before,? she replied. ?I just like to sing the words as they come?.</p>
<p>I noticed then that she was singing each word a millisecond late. She was doing a pretty good job of miming though. I&#8217;m not sure how many fans Fergus had in Towoomba before, but he definitely has one more now.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004746/440x345-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
This might sound like a depressing start to the tour. But it wasn&#8217;t. We drank some beers and got to know one another a bit and laughed about the whole thing. Everyone played really well and we got to know each other&#8217;s songs. Afterwards, we convoyed it back to Brisbane, past the lit-up cranes and construction sites that dot the Warrego highway.</p>
<p>We had a couple of days to kill before the Brisbane show. I got around with some old friends and checked the city out. It&#8217;s a great and interesting place for a Melbourne boy. Hot and sunny in winter, slightly strange accents you haven&#8217;t heard since the ?80s, coffee that comes in cups the size of pot glasses. I love it. Here&#8217;s an example of one of the locals:</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004747/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
One night I went and caught Fergus supporting Leader Cheetah for their Brisbane show. Sick.</p>
<p>We did the Brisbane show in a great warehouse space: LoFly Hangar. If you live in Brisbane and haven&#8217;t checked it out, you should try and catch something there soon. There was a great crowd and the place pretty much packed out. Fergus was up first and that night was the first night I heard his ?Vagina Song?. The lyrics of the first verse &#8211; ?You&#8217;re so soft and warm/I wonder what&#8217;s inside of you? &#8211; led me to believe that it could be a slightly soppy love song. The lyrics of the chorus &#8211; ?Vagina, vagina, vagina? &#8211; proved otherwise. Everyone cracked up in unison once they realised what he was singing about. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004749/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Helen played wonderfully, as always, joking, ?All my songs are vagina songs.? Somehow we got put on last and played pretty late, about 12.30am. To summarise the rest of the time there: I got drunk and we all caught planes to Sydney the next morning.</p>
<p>Kishore and I crashed at a friend&#8217;s house in Newtown and by the time we had breakfast and took a small walk along King Street it was time to head to the Hopetoun.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004748/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
This time we played first, and quite early, at about 6.30pm. I enjoy playing early. You can relax and have a few beers and talk to people. Also, Fergus got Helen and I to get up and sing ?Vagina, vagina, vagina?. I&#8217;ve never actually stood in front of a room of hundreds and yelled ?Vagina, vagina, vagina? into a microphone before. Always good to try something new. I met and had a brief chat with Jack Ladder, who we&#8217;re doing a another tour with in a couple of weeks. Apparently his real name is Tim Rogers. No shit! Must be something about the name.</p>
<p>I realised something important about touring. You come into a city, see some old friends who say, ?Mate, great to see you! Haven&#8217;t seen you for ages! Let&#8217;s get smashed tonight.? The next day you fly to another city and see some old friends who say, ?Mate, great to see you! Haven&#8217;t seen you for ages! Let&#8217;s get smashed tonight.? By the time we got back to Melbourne the next day I was worn out. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004750/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I had a few days of regular life, doing uni assignments and working in a call centre (I&#8217;d like to do a survey of Melbourne musicians one day, and quantify the number of Melbourne bands that survive working in call centres &#8211; it would be a lot). The last show was Friday at Curtin Bandroom, Carlton. It was a nice end to the whole thing. Everyone played really well, as usual. I must say, it felt great, after playing, to crash out in my own bed in Coburg.</p>
