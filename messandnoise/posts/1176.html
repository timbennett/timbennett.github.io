                <h3>Synth-punk brats <strong>JAKE ROBERTSON<em>*, **BILLY GARDNER**, **SHAUN CONNOR** and *</em>MARC DEAN</strong> reveal everything they ripped off for their debut album ?Amusements? &#8211; although they swear Duran Duran was an accident.

<h2>?Bad Day?  </h2>
<p>Jake: Like most of the songs from <em>Amusements</em>, this song was written in my bedroom in South Geelong in late 2011 and, like most of our songs, it is a bloody corker. Originally it was a cover of ?You Really Got Me? by The Kinks. After releasing it on the album I have had lots of comparisons to The Monks, who are one of my favourite bands, but it was unintentional. As far as the lyrics go, I think I was trying to channel <a href="http://theuvrace.bandcamp.com/track/good-money">?Good Money?</a> by UV Race? Not sure though; I just know my days are always awesome, so I was singing through a persona.</p>
<p>Billy: Vocals give me a <a href="http://theuvrace.bandcamp.com/track/speed-freak">?Speed Freak?</a> vibe, also by UV. This song got way better when Shaun joined (as did every song). </p>
<p>Shaun: I think everyone can relate to having one of those days where they just don&#8217;t want to wake up.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Daylight Robbery?  </h2>
<p>Jake: Another corker of a song. This is a warning to thieves out there. As Ausmuteants, we have a duty to keep the law in order. Do what uniformed cops aren&#8217;t capable of. We see a crime &#8211; it stops. Billy and I also started making a film clip to this song which involved a series of still images that we drew, played in time with the song &#8211; kind of like reading a comic book. We got about 15 seconds of it done. Stuff that, we have real crimes to stop.</p>
<p>Marc: For some reason this song took us like 50 takes and I started to go mad and hallucinating, thinking I was in that sick band Oasis. </p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1078144911/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Tinnitus?  </h2>
<p>Jake: My friend from Canberra (shoutout to Brendan Casey) thought this song yelled ?cunnilingus? in the chorus.</p>
<p>Billy: I made this up while Jake was taking a shit in my toilet ages ago. It&#8217;s way better than the song we were working on prior to him taking a shit. Took me ages to notice that I&#8217;d pretty directly stolen the <a href="/releases/2000737">?Paranoid Video?</a> riff though.</p>
<p>Marc: Last time we played The Tote these girls up the front were singing along with Billy but he was singing ?cunnilingus.? That was funny.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=3884582797/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?No Motivation?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This is a good one. I was trying to play Devo&#8217;s version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=i1ndN_NXf3o">?Secret Agent Man?</a> behind my head on guitar without listening to the song. Then I started singing Rolling Stones over the top in a really soulful voice. The lyrics are really good in this song. It is about me being the only person in the universe who doesn&#8217;t smoke weed, but I still have less motivation than them, even though they&#8217;re stoned. Of course I should state now that I do have motivation towards stopping crime, drug use and tardiness. Honorary Ausmuteant Edward did a very smart, original and amusing (/tv/4641714) to it for a large fee.</p>
<p>Shaun: Just chiming in to say that I do not get stoned all day. You can&#8217;t really make it out through the darkness, but I&#8217;m wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Generation_X">D-Generation X</a> T-shirt in the video. Suck it!</p>
<p>Billy: This is my favourite one from the LP. </p>
<p>Marc: Jake really shreds on this one. It also makes me think of ?Satisfaction? by The Stones.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=363100852/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Hate This Town?  </h2>
<p>Jake: Sensational song. A+. I was at Marc&#8217;s place discussing social economics and ways to prevent street crime, and while he was in his spa with a couple of babes I just made up this really killer riff. I was living in Geelong and I love Geelong, so I didn&#8217;t actually hate the town. I just hated the petty crime, drug use and overall tardiness that came with people living in any town. I think it was not being able to relate to some of the waste-case, Frisco-loving people always playing upstrokes and kicking a ball while shouting ?Hack.?</p>
<p>Shaun: I struggled to play the lead on this because I&#8217;m really bad at guitar. I think Billy&#8217;s friend Mitch (who once ate a packet of Shapes while having sex) was in the room while I kept fucking up the lead over and over again. I felt very sheepish.</p>
<p>Geelong is an absolute anomaly. The first time I went there all these teenagers with bowl cuts that skateboarded asked if I was into garage. I listened to mostly hardcore punk at the time, and found the whole landscape baffling. My friend from Canberra who skates and listens to ?60s garage wanted to move to Geelong immediately after we visited. He had found his spiritual home where he could rock paisley while doing wallrides and not feel out of place.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1321298443/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Pissing in Two Streams?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This is Tim Scott (A+ journalist for <em>M+N*)?s favourite song on the album. So you do the math &#8211; absolute pearler. There is a panel inside the comic book by Ivan Brunetti called *Schizo</em>, where he is peeing in the toilet while his wife is standing next to him, and he pisses all over her leg because ?there&#8217;s a pube in his piss-shaft.? Although a very amateur move by Brunetti, that was my only inspiration for this song; the rest is all very original. Also doing the two-stream piss after you&#8217;ve got jiggy &#8211; I thought I broke my pecker the first time that happened when I was nine.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1010047801/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Kicked in the Head by a Horse?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This is another great track. Amazing way to open the B-side of the record. There&#8217;s a guy in Geelong named Chopsticks. He claims the nickname comes from him having two dicks, which is actually pretty amazing because he isn&#8217;t a person to muck around; he is a real straight arrow. Chopsticks got kicked in the head by a horse when he was younger? which I thought was really funny, because he had two dicks. I had a riff at home, and the name written down for ages. Then I went over to Billy&#8217;s house and he had some chords. The words came ages after, probably because so much effort went into them.</p>
<p>Billy: Rhyming ?unstable? with ?stable? is great. So is the bass line in the chorus. This one was hilarious to sit in on when Jake recorded the vocals.</p>
<p>Marc: I think Jake sang this one first after 12 hours of jamming, recording 23 songs and me Billy and Shaun sat down with some Shapes. We laughed so much that Shaun had to give Billy the Heimlich trick so he didn&#8217;t die. I think.</p>
<p>Shaun: Having two dicks would kind of suck, hey. I think it would be hard to be satisfied.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3867109508/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=339518213/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://ausmuteants.bandcamp.com/album/amusements">Amusements by AUSMUTEANTS</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Stepped in Shit?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This song is pretty average. I don&#8217;t like the main riff at all. The only parts I like are rhyming ?shit? with ?thing? and I like the ending. Prefer it to be in the garbage bin rather than on the album. Tim Scott&#8217;s second favourite song though, so you do the math.</p>
<p>Shaun: I think this was used as background music for a news article about rough trade (the sex act, not the label). I can kinda understand that: the chorus sounds like it has a sleazy glam vibe.</p>

<h2>?Flushing Problems?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This song is amazing. I was trying to create an original fusion comprising of the vocal melodies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Spits">The Spits</a> and the rhythms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black</em>Devil<em>Disco</em>Club">Black Devil Disco Club</a>. Instead, while recording it, Michael Young (Eddy Current/Woollen Headache) pointed out that I had ripped off Duran Duran note-for-note. I&#8217;d never heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=e3W6yf6c-FA">?Rio?</a> before, but I feel like I hear it every time now. At least our song is better. Billy made up the solo at the end, which is a cool little Mirrors-styled lick.</p>
<p>Marc: I like it after shows when people tell me that the bass line rules. I always say thanks but it&#8217;s really Jake shredding some Bowie jams. Since he wrote the song.</p>
<p>Shaun: Can confirm that Jake had never heard ?Rio? before. This sounds exactly like Duran Duran.</p>

<h2>?Inducing Instinct?  </h2>
<p>Jake: Everybody always thinks this one is Devo-inspired &#8211; but they&#8217;re wrong. It is really very original; one has to admire the ingenuity that comes with this song. I was listening to Fear a lot when I wrote it. The lyrics are from a little science-fiction story I wrote about living in a world where you could insert a pill into your urethra to take away free thought and just live with the OG human instinct. Shaun thought the chorus was ?inducing a steak? for a long time, which is a far greater lyric which still could work with the song if we ate with our genitals.</p>

<h2>?Pissed Myself Twice?  </h2>
<p>Jake: This is a truly haunting song that is sung with brutal honesty and conviction. Ausmuteants do not condone public urination or weakness. Many people think this song is autobiographical, but they need to clean the shit out of their brain. I am no weakling kid; I once chugged a slab without taking a single piss. I know how to hold it in. I was merely using the techniques of Jello Biafra and singing from the enemy&#8217;s perspective. The song came about after I saw this little puny kid shit his pants at a shopping centre. Although funny, the memories came back of seeing all my peers pissing their pants in school and I remember them feeling real embarrassed and sorry for themselves when they pissed their pants. I was six, but I was still aware at how pathetic they were.</p>
<p>Billy: The solo is the best bit. It sounds like Eric Clapton, which is hilarious. Jake&#8217;s teenage guitar years are paying off.</p>
<p>Shaun: Definitely pissed my pants in preschool. It went everywhere. The most recent time I soiled myself I had food poisoning and puked about 10 times in the bath. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha<em>siu</em>bao">Char siu bao</a> can be a risky food. The morning after vomiting, I sharted in bed. I don&#8217;t know how my girlfriend can still look at me.</p>

<h2>?Fran Drescher&#8217;s Alien Abduction?  </h2>
<p>Billy: Had to steal the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=g4-2onb62y8&amp;">?Girl U Want?</a> drum fill in this one.</p>
<p>Marc: I think we are making a video to this one, where I get to play Fran. This makes me happy since I like girls clothes.</p>
<p>Shaun: This one is definitely super offensive and hard to defend. I&#8217;d probably say it is straight-up indefensible. I don&#8217;t know if there is a way to convey the amount of respect and admiration I have for Fran Drescher without sounding insincere here.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I read a really terrifying report of someone who claimed they were raped by a ?grey? type alien. The alien just sat on top of her, unmoving, while she felt all kinds of stuff happening to her genitals.	 I want to believe.</p>
