<strong>Are you making it up as you go?</strong><br/>
Yep, Totally. I learn from my mistakes. I couldn&#8217;t believe the shit that went down in 2009. I put so much of my heart and soul into the event and I couldn&#8217;t believe the bitchiness that went down. I wanted to quit. I couldn&#8217;t handle offending all these people. For Aussie bands it&#8217;s a really good opportunity to come to the country, have a holiday, see what the country is like, play Camp and sell some merch. Some bands sell a shitload of merch, $1000 plus. </p>
<p><strong>I wanted to talk about the Renegade Stage, where bands who aren&#8217;t on the official lineup can buy tickets to come to camp and then play. Why do you feel you have to draw a distinction between the official stages and the renegade stage? Why not just include it as part of all the other stages and treat the bands the same as everyone else?</strong><br/>
Maybe, um, because some really dubious bands play on the Renegade Stage!? The idea of the stage came because I would often go along to festivals and think, ?Fuck, I could throw a better party than this man &#8211; I know bands who are better than this!? And so it was like my challenge to people. If you think you can do better, come along and blow everyone away. It&#8217;s now getting to the point where the punters are spending more time in the renegade room than in the main stage area.</p>
<p><strong>And you&#8217;re getting all that for free, because you&#8217;re not paying Renegade Bands, in fact, they are paying you.</strong><br/>
Well not free, remember I&#8217;m providing a PA, dedicated engineer, lighting, backline, a room for three days. And I can&#8217;t take the Renegade Stage away now; it&#8217;s become too important a feature of Camp. But I don&#8217;t have the budget to run another official stage. In a way I am trying to create this spontaneity, which is the hardest thing to do. These days I pre-book nearly half the spots but a lot of the rest of it is just people hanging out at Camp and deciding to put on a show, in a lot of cases forming a band on the spot. And to have a stage where you can do that &#8211; I think that&#8217;s fairly rad. </p>
<blockquote><p>?It would be amazing to be able to discover a Melbourne band that even Melburnians haven&#8217;t heard of and invite them to play.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do bands get offended when they ask to be on the official lineup and are told they are welcome to play, but it will be on an ?unofficial? stage and they&#8217;ll have to still buy tickets?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know if they get offended. Frustrated maybe. I don&#8217;t like flat-out saying no to bands that they can&#8217;t play at all though. The other thing is I can&#8217;t have too many bands of the same genre play on the official lineup. Even if an amazing band contacts me, well, I can&#8217;t have a fifth math-rock band play, you know? But yes, it definitely helps sell tickets, maybe an additional 100? It never started with that intention though &#8211; it was more a side-effect of it. Another thing is, even if I don&#8217;t like your band initially, this stage is your chance to prove me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the ratio of Renegade Stage performances to official lineup performances.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s about 50/50 now.</p>
<p><strong>So in real terms you&#8217;re still only really paying half the bands who play camp?</strong><br/>
Well, if you want to get cold and harsh on the matter then, yes: only half the bands get paid. But I&#8217;m only asking half those bands to play. That fact is I just can&#8217;t afford to pay bands for that stage, and if I did, I&#8217;d have to start having a selection process which makes the whole concept redundant. That&#8217;s one of the reason these festivals in Australia are failing. It&#8217;s so hard to make money from it. Being very sensible with my artist budget is perhaps what has kept the event going all this time. One of the reasons many upstart festivals in Australia do fail is that it&#8217;s very difficult to make any money putting on festivals. </p>
<p><strong>Do you make money from it?</strong><br/>
I made money one year. Ironically that was 2009. But that money went to paying off the debt from the first two years. It&#8217;s a bloody tight budget. I run a production suitable for a festival of 5000 people, but only allow a max of 1500 people onsite including performers. There&#8217;s no sponsorship, I make no money from alcohol sales (camp is unlicensed), the catering is by a private company. It&#8217;s all just ticket sales.</p>
<p><strong>How many tickets are you selling this year?</strong><br/>
1000 tickets, with a 1500 capacity. That&#8217;s up from 300 in the first year, but I&#8217;ve capped it at that now.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Another criticism has been the perceived lack of security on the gate. Do you actually pay for security?</strong><br/>
Yes, I do. But they&#8217;re not un-uniformed.  </p>
<p><strong>You have to admit it&#8217;s been pretty easy to just walk in to the festival.</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally. </p>
<p><strong>So how do punters who have shelled out 200 bucks for a ticket feel when they see others just walking in for free?</strong><br/>
I do pay for security, but I don&#8217;t like uniformed security and I don&#8217;t like big guys. I just want regular looking people, no uniforms. In 2010 it was very easy to walk in, but I&#8217;ve totally overhauled how I handle security now. I&#8217;ve always had at least one person on the gate overnight, and my volunteers handle things during the day. But like any festival if you really want to sneak in you can usually find a way.  This year I&#8217;m really clamping down on perimeter security because I know the weakness of it at the moment. The security budget&#8217;s going up by four times the amount I spent in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>In the first year camp had lots of other Camp-like activities: games, confidence courses, pool parties, bands playing in trees, egg-and-spoon races. Is it becoming a more ?normal? music festival now?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say so. That&#8217;s partly reason for the name change to ?Campus?. I&#8217;ve ended up taking the best things about the early Camps and putting them in a modern music festival template. A festival with soul. I now really want people to see the bands. In the early camps sometimes there would only be 10 people watching the bands because others would be off canoeing or whatever!</p>

<strong>One of your biggest coups was getting Neil Finn to play a surprise set, with full band, on the main stage on the last night of the 2009 Camp. How did that come about?</strong><br/>
Neil&#8217;s been following the Low Hum thing for many years. His son Liam was one of the very first contributors to my zine back in 2003. Liam played the first Camps and would go back and tell Neil how amazing it was. So Neil emailed me and said he really wanted to see it. My initial idea was to have an orienteering course and to give people maps and when they finished the course they would come across Neil Finn playing next to a tree in the woods. But in the end Liam came up with the idea of forming a Finn family band and doing a more normal slot on the main stage. And by the way, Neil didn&#8217;t ask for any money!</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you have for anyone wanting to organise a festival? I&#8217;m guessing ?begin small?.</strong><br/>
Yep, of course. And work out how much money you can afford to lose.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think went wrong with festivals like <a href="/news/3776359">Blueprint</a> and <a href="/news/4046812">BAM!</a>?</strong><br/>
The advice I would have is never take on too much than you can handle. And never ever cancel an event. I hate it when festivals cancel. Because you can refund tickets but what about the travel that people have booked accommodation, travel, etc.? Also they didn&#8217;t have a brand name. No one had heard of them before. Festivals seem to want to start where they want to finish. A lot of bands spend four years building up to their first album because they have this huge ?vision? but don&#8217;t realise that they would be better off putting out one record a year for four years, and they would build a following and become better songwriters in the process. The same can be said for festivals.</p>
<p><strong>I guess the festival organiser&#8217;s dream is discovering bands no one&#8217;s heard of and bringing them to your festival to have them blow everyone away.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s part of my mission wherever I go. It would be amazing to be able to discover a Melbourne band that even Melburnians haven&#8217;t heard of and invite them to play. So even tonight when I&#8217;m running between venues to see bands I&#8217;ve planned to seeing I&#8217;ll also be popping my head in to random places if I hear music and seeing what&#8217;s going on. I would love to live in Melbourne for maybe a month next year and just see as much as I can. I&#8217;m actually living in Auckland for a month in December, and just going out every night to see four or five bands a night. Just to try to get a really good grip on the Auckland scene. I&#8217;d love to do the same in Australia. What attracts me to Melbourne is the same reason I could never move here &#8211; I&#8217;d want to go out every night of the week. I would burn out.</p>
