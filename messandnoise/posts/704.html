                <h3>Ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s Jagermeister Independent Music Awards in Melbourne, we ask some nominees whether they&#8217;re independent by necessity or choice.
</h3>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Big Scary</h2>
<h2>#(Answered by Tom Iansek)</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Breakthrough Independent Artist Of The Year</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes an &#8220;independent&#8221; artist to you?</strong><br/>
Obviously an unsigned artist, but I believe being ?independent? more broadly encompasses the ability to shape the band in whatever way feels most natural to the artist, free from outside opinion, judgment and pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Are you independent out of necessity or choice?</strong><br/>
Both. We are lucky that we have the ability to stay independent as an artist. Being a two-piece, many costs such as recording and touring are smaller. Many bands obviously don&#8217;t have this luxury and therefore must look to labels to cover these costs otherwise their music just couldn&#8217;t happen. We therefore choose to be independent because we can and because it allows us the freedom to work the way we want to work. We also believe that with the music industry as it is currently, and the way it is heading in the future, being independent is also a necessity, particularly in Australia. Labels dropping huge sums of money for an album that the artist will never be able to recoup does not make for a long-term career.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been signed to, or been courted by a major label?</strong><br/>
We once had a major label person buy us lunch, does that count? We&#8217;ve always had a strong stance against major label involvement, so there has never been any offers on the table. I do feel that their ways, while they may be great for perhaps an international pop-star are not at all relevant and can often be damaging to small, developing artists like us.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think being an independent artist is more conducive to the way music is being made and distributed now?</strong><br/>
Absolutely. Music can be made relatively inexpensively these days in bedrooms and home studios and can be promoted and distributed easily online. With some outside help from the right people, an artist can do all that a label can.</p>
<p><strong>Would signing to a major offer you any advantages at all?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t want to discredit labels completely, I think they can do great things for some artists, it&#8217;s very case by case. In our case I think there would definitely be some advantages to signing to a major, such as access to a big marketing department and &#8211; maybe if we sold some CDs &#8211; they could take us out for boozy eye-fillet steak dinners. However, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re very well-suited to the slow-churning major label machine, and we&#8217;d ultimately find it stifling and creatively inhibitive.</p>

<h2>#(Answered by Oscar Slorach-Thorn)</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Breakthrough Independent Artist Of The Year</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes an &#8220;independent&#8221; artist to you?</strong><br/>
I think it can be a bit blurry where the line is some times, but in short, it&#8217;s an artist who is not tied into anything creatively compromising (within limits).</p>
<p><strong>Are you independent out of necessity or choice?</strong><br/>
I would like to think out of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been signed to, or been courted by a major label?</strong>   Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think being an independent artist is more conducive to the way music is being made and distributed now?</strong><br/>
I would say, yes. Artists can be extremely self-sufficient if they dedicate a lot of time to blog culture and independent radio to get their stuff heard. I also think that the independent label vibe suits how quickly music changes. It would seem to me that now days that people get sick of an artist really quickly as soon as they &#8220;get too big for their boots&#8221;. People like to discover artists before they are successful, so they can have them as a secret.</p>
<p><strong>Would signing to a major offer you any advantages at all?</strong><br/>
Absolutely! I would consider it a huge jump start. Everything would happen a lot faster. You would find your self with amazing merch, air play, media coverage and all that straight away. I just think it&#8217;s more satisfying and more respectable to earn things through hard work &#8211; that way it really feels like its yours. And I think it&#8217;s possible to get equally far with an independent [label].</p>

<h2>#(Answered by Henry Wagons)</h2>
<p><strong>Nominated:</strong> Best Independent Country Album (<em><a href="/releases/2000873">Rumble, Shake and Tumble</a></em>)</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes an &#8220;independent&#8221; artist to you?</strong><br/>
From my understanding, an independent artist is one whose work is not being overseen by a major label. As an independent artist there are less people invested in your work than would be with a big company and, therefore, less opinions to sift through when making creative output. In general, that affords a little more creative freedom, which can be really fun to work with. To use a Lego analogy, when I was a kid I liked making whatever I liked from my Lego pieces, not just the Star Wars X-Wing in the instruction booklet.</p>
<p><strong>Are you independent out of necessity or choice?</strong><br/>
I have been with the stellar independent label Spunk for four records now. I love them, and have no plans to move anywhere! I love playing Lego with them the most.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been signed to, or been courted by a major label?</strong><br/>
I have had many a beer-soaked chat with people at major labels at my own shows and others. They are generally more likely to be about great records or big nights than about working together.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think being an independent artist is more conducive to the way music is being made and distributed now?</strong><br/>
There is a definite exciting rise in independent culture that has come with the ability to both consume and disseminate information over the internet. I have had to increase the speed and size of my internet plan at home to cope with all the independence flowing through my web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Would signing to a major offer you any advantages at all?</strong><br/>
If I did, I may be more likely to get to sing that duet with Dolly.</p>

<p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best Independent Artist, Best Independent Album (<em><a href="/releases/2000903">Design Desire</a></em>)</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes an &#8220;independent&#8221; artist to you?</strong><br/>
I suppose it really just means that you aren&#8217;t signed to a major label.</p>
<p><strong>Are you independent out of necessity or choice?</strong><br/>
A bit of both. I prefer the creative freedom afforded by an indie label but I haven&#8217;t signed to a major because the deals they have offered are not particularly in my favour.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been signed to, or been courted by a major label?</strong><br/>
I said no, because I couldn&#8217;t see the deals that were offered as being good for us in the long term. I think it is a mistake to think that the bigger the cash advance &#8211; the better. Often, the bigger the deal, the more rights you sign away.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think being an independent artist is more conducive to the way music is being made and distributed now?</strong><br/>
Yes, I think the Internet affords an ease of distribution to musicians that was non existent prior to download sites like iTunes and video share sites like YouTube. It is becoming easier to reach the rest of the world without the help of big record labels.</p>
<p><strong>Would signing to a major offer you any advantages at all?</strong><br/>
It depends on the deal. The main advantage of being signed to a major &#8211; if it had good ethics behind its decision-making and the kind of deals it offers its artists &#8211; is that there are most likely greater resources at your disposal. There are always advantages and disadvantages to anything but I really think, at the end of the day, if you focus on writing good music, people will listen regardless of whether or not you are signed to a major or indie label.</p>
