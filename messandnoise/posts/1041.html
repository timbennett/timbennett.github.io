                <h3><strong>DAN FLYNN</strong>?s third album as Major Chord expands from a home-recorded solo project into a studio-recorded full band. Below, the Melbourne songwriter picks away at the details, from Beatles nods to writer&#8217;s block.

<h2>?Everything is Everything?  </h2>
<p>This is probably the simplest of all the songs on the album in terms of structure and arrangement. For me, however, it has a kind of ?complex simplicity?, having a three-part groove that binds the music together and allows for the vocal to sit perfectly in place. The song opens with a ?chuggy? double-tracked guitar and mandolin, which sets a slightly funky rhythm for the first verse. Then the chorus hits and the groove is complete with the ?ba ba boom? of the floor tom and the double-tracked shakers that nestle in closely with the strumming guitar and mandolin. When I&#8217;m singing this song I feel like I&#8217;m lying at the bottom of a boat rolling with the waves. Either that or crowdsurfing at a folk festival.</p>

<h2>?As the Night Closes In?  </h2>
<p>The ocean is not a particularly inspiring place for me as a songwriter and I&#8217;ve never been attracted to ?beachy? music. However, I did in fact write this song [near] the beach. I could hear the waves rolling and I started to imagine a man on a boat madly searching for something out to sea, convinced he is on an important mission. I then imagined his lover standing on the shore calling him home, knowing that his ego has gotten hold of him again and that he is merely floating pointlessly out to sea. As you might expect, these imaginings are pretty reflective of my relationship with my wife?</p>
<p>What I enjoy about this track musically is that, although it has a similar tempo throughout, it contains four different rhythms/grooves. The first verse begins with a mellow plucked guitar (amid the sound of ocean waves) which then changes into a strumming first chorus. As we move into the second verse the song ?lifts off? as Aaron [Pepper]?s subtle but groovy percussion kicks in and Phil [Collings]? bass becomes ever-so-slightly funky. The final change happens in the second chorus when the violins get going and we bust out into a full-band sea shanty.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Rubber House?  </h2>
<p>The musicologists out there won&#8217;t have trouble spotting the Beatles references in this track. One of my favourite albums is indeed <em>Rubber Soul</em>, and Paul McCartney&#8217;s lyric ?newspaper taxis? surely influenced the line of this song ?The man gets into his paper car.? I once heard a quote that goes something like, ?It doesn&#8217;t matter what you steal, it&#8217;s what you do with it.?</p>
<p>What makes this track come together for me is the fact that it begins will soft double-tracked falsetto vocals but then sidesteps and turns into something of a duet as the band kicks in. Meabh [Friel] takes on my original vocal melody and I come in with the harmony. Some harmonies are designed to simply support and ?sweeten? the lead vocal, while others exist as an entirely new vocal melody and sit side by side with the lead. So it is with ?Rubber House?.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92425210%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ZBVPh"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Transition?  </h2>
<p>This was the first song written for the album and we all got pretty excited about it. The first half of the song is mellow and kinda haunting and then the band kicks in and we go a bit crazy. When it came time to record this song we knew we had to record it live, that is, with all members of the band playing at once in the studio to create the necessary ?cohesion?. We also knew we had to nail it in a single take, as we recorded the album to analogue tape and did not have the luxury of digital editing. Our engineer (and Life Coach at the time), Callum John Barter, carefully set up the microphones as we readied ourselves for the perfect take.</p>
<p>In my opinion we did indeed capture the song perfectly, despite me hitting a bum note on my guitar within the first few seconds. It was the kind of clunky ?boing? that would normally cause me to start all over gain, but the tension and the energy of all of us crammed into every available room in the studio caused me to think ?fuck it? and I just kept playing. The ?fuck it? element no doubt helped me and the band loosen up and play with abandon and capture the song as it was meant to be, perfectly imperfect.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?When the Morning Comes?  </h2>
<p>This is a little song I wrote in about seven minutes. I think I had been listening to Cat Stevens at the time. When Meabh and I recorded the song with Callum we wanted an ?old school? sound. So, like the good ol? days, we gathered around a single mic which captured everything &#8211; Meabh and my vocals and the guitar. It took a bit of time to get the right mix, which was achieved by moving closer or further away from the mic, but we got there in the end.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?The Next Big Thing?  </h2>
<p>Ok, so this is a bit of a rant?.</p>
<p>The Next Big Thing was written partly out of amusement but also frustration at the proliferation of TV talent shows and their obsession with finding the ?Next Big Thing?. Music is consumed like junk food; hype and glitter are mistaken for musical talent and TV networks and audiences gorge themselves on the hopes and dreams of starry-eyed contestants.</p>
<p>After the big season finale the program ends and we all lose interest, only to be sucked back into the hype machine for another round with another band of hopefuls. Of course the Money Men are the only winners in this saga and, as the hype dissolves, most of the contestants go back to working in retail.</p>
<p>But what about Guy Sebastian you say? Well, he was one of the first and the Gods of Reality TV often smile upon the early winners while the rest are subject to the law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92425212%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ZBVPh"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?I Don&#8217;t Want to Break You?  </h2>
<p>This is a very personal song written for my wife apologising for all the times I suffer from DBS (Dumb Boy Syndrome).</p>
<p>I recorded this song live, playing guitar and singing at the same time. The only way finger-picky folk songs should be recorded, in my opinion. I then enlisted the help of long-time collaborator Kate Connor, who, along with Meabh, added the string parts which gave the track added emotional depth and that ?yearning? quality.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92425213%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ZBVPh"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Tomorrow is a World Away?  </h2>
<p>I have nothing against indie rock (I do enjoy much of it) although I&#8217;ve never really wanted or considered Major Chord to fall within this genre. But to my ears that&#8217;s exactly how this song begins. It&#8217;s got the fairly run-of-the-mill drums, the bopping bass and the little-too-funky-for-me vocals. But I couldn&#8217;t resist; it&#8217;s just the way the song came out. However, I felt that this ?indie-rockness? needed to be offset by some ?folkiness? to even up the balance and bring it back to the world of Major Chord.</p>
<p>So after the ?indie rocking? first verse the song breaks down into a pre-chorus as I sing, ?Though I can&#8217;t keep saying that I&#8217;m going through a phase?? We then launch into folk/pop world with a catchy but decidedly ?un-indie rock? chorus without any drums at all. We then go back into indie-rock-world for the second verse before returning to drum-less folk/pop world for the second chorus and so on?</p>
<p>The arrangement shouldn&#8217;t really work (maybe for some of you it doesn&#8217;t) but to me the song sounds exactly like I imagined it in my head when I wrote it, which is, of course, the ultimate aim of a songwriter.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92425216%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ZBVPh"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Along the Riverside?  </h2>
<p>This song is fairly bleak. Often my bleak songs wind their way into something more positive, but this one doesn&#8217;t. Anyway, lyrical content aside?</p>
<p>This is one of the two songs on the album (the other one being the final track) where I couldn&#8217;t ?beat the demo?. This is a common dilemma for home recordists like me. You write a new song and then rush out to the garage, full of excitement, to record a demo version. Of course you often capture the raw energy, the essence, the ?vibe? of the song perfectly and then, months later, when you try to re-record it in a ?proper studio?, you just can&#8217;t capture the same character or tone, no matter how expensive the microphones.</p>
<p>So in this case I ditched the higher fidelity studio version of this song and went back to the demo. Ah, the demo?</p>

<h2>?The Rain Song?  </h2>
<p>No surprises that ?The Rain Song? was written while it was raining. This song, funnily enough, broke ?the drought?. I&#8217;d been experiencing some writer&#8217;s block until one day I started plucking away on my $50 piece-of-shit nylon-string guitar when I came up with this tune. The rain was pouring &#8211; it had been a long wet winter &#8211; and I wondered if it would ever stop. I couldn&#8217;t resist pointing a microphone out the window to record some of the rain, which then found its way into the closing seconds of the track. Soon after, I wrote another four songs and <em>Transition</em> was complete.</p>

<p/>
<p>So that&#8217;s it. For those of you who are patient enough, there is a hidden track that emerges after the rain, but I can&#8217;t talk about it because it&#8217;s hidden.</p>
