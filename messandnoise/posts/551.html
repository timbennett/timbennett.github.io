                <h3>On their maiden tour of the US, Melbourne&#8217;s Super Wild Horses &#8211; <strong>AMY FRANZ<em>* and *</em>HAYLEY MCKEE</strong> &#8211; play Gonerfest in Memphis, hang out a smoky karaoke den in Philly and plan a hip-hop side project on a Statten Island Ferry.
</h3>
<p>After an arduous flight where the fourth engine on our Qantas plane fails to start, we&#8217;re cruising through the air. The hands of time turn backwards and we arrive in the states before we even left. We have a five-hour stop-over in LA, made exciting by the appearance of a strutting Lady Ga Ga in a head to toe beige bodysuit and blue Lennon glasses through LAX Airport. We decide to escape out of there and head to Manhattan Beach for some fresh air and Amy&#8217;s secret desire to spot Anthony Kiedis in the waves.</p>
<img class="r" data-src="/images/3016896/440x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<h2>New York</h2>
<p>We finally make it to New York and check into an East Village hotel. A 24-hour yakitori joint across the road injects nutrition into us via spicy soups, kimchi and beer. Pass out.</p>
<p><strong>Day one:</strong></p>
<p>Walk 50 odd blocks around the city and end up on tourist overload on a hired horse and cart through central park. We never knew how much of <em>Home Alone 1*, *2* and *3</em> had been filmed in this area! That night, we head to East Harlem to meet Amy&#8217;s sister, watch some jazz and eat Creole. On the way to the joint, we take a wrong turn into a dodgy neighbourhood and fear for our lives. A cop car slows down and asks, ?What the hell are you girls doing here?? Amy imagines having to call Hayley&#8217;s mum to tell her she&#8217;s been shot.</p>
<p><strong>Day Two:</strong></p>
<p>We find ourselves totally overcome by jetlag and decide to get some air on a ferry. Hayley, who&#8217;s been to New York before, acts as tour guide and puts us on the Staten Island ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. As we chug past the statue from a great, great distance it dawns on us we&#8217;re on the wrong boat and headed to a new exotic destination: Staten Island. It&#8217;s not at all exotic, and not really worth talking about. Don&#8217;t go there!</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016901/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
On the ferry back we&#8217;re a bit delirious. Contrary to the Staten Island Info Booth claiming the highlight of the island to be a shoddy Mexican takeaway, we find the highlight of the day to be the outrageous freestyling opportunities that come about when you&#8217;re on a near empty ferry in NYC. By the time we get back to Manhattan we&#8217;re convinced we could have side careers a la M.I.A. and plan a Super Wild Horses breakaway album. That night we meet up with Mikey (ECSR) and Georgia (UV Race) at Craig&#8217;s (Scott &amp; Charlene&#8217;s Wedding, Spider Vomit) new Brooklyn joint. He lives across the road from Ponce Funeral Homes. We buy beers from the corner store, complete with decorative bullet proof cage. It&#8217;s a great evening catching up on tales from the UV Race/Total Control tour and hearing Craig&#8217;s new escapades in the big apple.</p>
<p><strong>Day Three:</strong></p>
<p>We wake up and realise the day has finally arrived for us to play a show &#8211; this is where our tour really begins! We&#8217;ve got two shows booked in for the night. The first is at Death By Audio with Pink Reason, Total Control (TC), UV Race (UV) and Moving Stills. The second show is at Cameo Gallery with Reading Rainbow, Night Manager and The Caterpillars.</p>
<p>As we haul our gear into a taxi, an apocalyptic storm hits the Brooklyn coast. One man dies by rogue tree branch. The subway system is down. Amy hits someone in the face trying to hail a cab.</p>
<p>Death by Audio is a worn out venue with an awesome bunch of guys running the show. Our nerves hit and our dinky casio tour keyboard dies on us before we start playing. We launch into our first jet-lagged and sludgy set. Although we&#8217;d played better, it was symbolically important to have the first show under our belts. As soon as we finished we sprinted eight blocks down the road to Cameo Gallery. Unfortunately, this meant we missed TC, UV and PR but heard it was a killer gig.</p>
<p>Cameo Gallery is a pretty small warehouse space with a large fabric chandelier hanging over the drum kit. We played much better this time around. The few people who were there seemed to really enjoy the show. They cheered at the opening chords of <a href="/tv/3950110">?Golden Town?</a>, which was a bizarre surprise. Only caught Reading Rainbow&#8217;s set; a husband-wife duo based out of Philadelphia who were brilliant.</p>
<p>After the Cameo Gallery show we hung with our buddies back at DBA. Everyone was getting loose by this stage, and Harry from Almost Ready Records (who put out our first release as part of the <em>World&#8217;s Lousy with Ideas Volume 7</em> compilation) suggested we play a third show for the night. The booze said yes and we loaded our gear into an eight-seater van headed to the seedy Don Pedro&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Hayley went back inside momentarily. Amy was half in/half out of the van trying to convince the driver not to drive off with our gear, yelling, ?You can&#8217;t leave without my bandmate!? Eventually, Hayley emerged from the venue with 10 new friends. Suddenly there were 20 people in the van all piled on top of gear and each other, all wasted, all grinning, all loud.</p>
<p>Don Pedro&#8217;s is an oily old hole. We were convinced we were going to get glassed during this set, but by this stage were so well oiled ourselves that our Dutch courage took over and we wobbled onto the stage. By this stage it was 3am and there were about 15 drunks swaying along to our tunes. Overall, the three-shows-in-one-night scenario turns out to be a pretty awesome induction into overseas touring. If we can get through this, we feel like we can get through anything.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Philadelphia</h2>
<p><strong>Day Four:</strong></p>
<p>This feeling of invincibility is mocked when we rise at 6am to catch a bus to Philadelphia. Whiskey turned from friend to foe as we drag our gear down endless flights of stairs, cursing our inability to pack light. Hayley decides to flag down a limousine, momentarily blinded by the soft leather seats and attractive driver. We refuse a lift to the bus station as it&#8217;s gonna cost us $20. In the end our taxi costs us $25. The first regret of the tour.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016898/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Sleep on bus to Philly. We&#8217;re picked up at the station by Herbie, the guy who booked our show in Philadelphia and our host for the night. Get a comprehensive tour of the sunny city as Herbie keeps getting lost on the way to Cha Cha Razzi, the artist-studio turned gig space for our show with SOARS, Party Photographers and Far Out Fangtooth.</p>
<p>SOARS were up first and a real highlight. They lugged their own extra PA just for the drum machine. A gloomy, sonic wash of sound slugs the crowd. Next were Far Out Fangtooth who wore matching denim jackets, looked amazing and pulled out goth glam glory.</p>
<p>By now, there was a really good crowd for our set including a pug dog wearing a sailor&#8217;s costume. They all got in close, danced and even sang along to ?Mess Around?. We realised halfway through the song ?Adrian?, which was written about Rocky, that we were in the city where these epic films (yes) were based. Wow. It was a real party atmosphere. Hayley rates this one of her favourite gigs ever.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016900/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Party Photographers have great songs and a magnetic front woman. They seemed disappointed by the sound that night, but for us they sounded great. After the show all the bands hung out at a smoky karaoke den called Rick&#8217;s Birthday Bar, then onto the quintessential Philadelphia late night meal &#8211; the Philly Cheese Steak, a roll at least a foot long stuffed with BBQ beef and topped with whizz cheese, which is a radioactive yellow coronary nightmare straight out of a can. We&#8217;ve never had anything like it. By this time it was 5am and time to crash at Herbie&#8217;s. Hayley thoroughly enjoyed Amy&#8217;s man-like snoring and resorted to muffling the noise by placing a cat on Amy&#8217;s head.</p>
<h2>Chicago</h2>
<p><strong>Day Five:</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited about reaching Chicago not only because of the two shows we have lined up, but because we finally get to meet Todd from Hozac Records. This is the label who released our album <em>Fifteen</em> in the states as well as releasing vinyl from Jacuzzi Boys, Dum Dum Girls, Wizzard Sleeve, Woven Bones and Smith Westerns. We couldn&#8217;t wait to put a face to the man we&#8217;d shared many emails, courier correspondences and chats with.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016908/480x640-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Todd picks us up from the airport with Zac from Outer Minds who we&#8217;d be playing with later that night. Both the guys are instantly lovable, warm and generous. Zac told us shootings were regular in his neighbourhood and someone had died in the alleyway behind his house just two nights before. For a country that is so progressive in many regards, it&#8217;s still stunning to learn of the social disorder and divide that plagues many cities here.</p>
<p>Todd takes us home to his place, a converted nunnery decked out with walls of records and knick knacks. Hung over from the night before and the night before that and the night before that, we jump at the chance to have a cup of tea and chill out for an hour before sound check. We flick through his vinyl collection and listen to the test pressing for French cave band Subtle Turnips.</p>
<p>Soundcheck at Empty Bottle and then Todd and his girl Erin take us out for a feast of slow pulled pork and collard greens. We feel alive again and ready to play.</p>
<p>The Empty Bottle is a super venue, really well run and with a great layout. The <em>Mrs. Pacman</em> arcade game wins Hayley&#8217;s heart. Tonight we&#8217;re playing with Outer Minds, Wet Hair and headliners White Mystery. All great bands that command the stage and create a high-energy evening. We&#8217;re just on before White Mystery and play to a packed audience pressed up against the stage. In our minds, the pressure is on to impress Todd and prove that we were worth putting out! With four US shows complete, we hit our stride tonight and a sense of freedom and exhilaration kicks in. We get the best response of the tour and proceed to celebrate late into the night.</p>
<p><strong>Day Six:</strong></p>
<p>We all struggled the next morning. A mass breakfast was organised before we headed to play an in-store at Permanent Records. On the way to the show Todd asks where our drum kit is. Assuming he was still drunk we laughed off this question, only to realise he thought we&#8217;d packed our entire drum kit into our cases. A last minute drum kit of salvaged scrap hardware and an enormous blue sparkly marching band bass drum is somehow rustled up. We arrive late for our in-store but luckily the crowd has hung around. After a very fun set, we hit the store for some serious record shopping, followed by our last supper with Todd and Erin and a night in watching Fatal Attraction. Amy has nightmares about Glenn Close.</p>
<p><strong>Day Seven:</strong></p>
<p>We all accidentally sleep in and have a mad rush to the airport. Excess oversize baggage of our newly acquired SWH merchandise and LPs mean we miss our flight. The day becomes a blur of airports, bad food and wrangling with unsympathetic airline staff.</p>

<h2>Memphis</h2>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016904/336x448-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Memphis has been the city we&#8217;ve been dreaming of and the gig offer that started the reality of a tour to the states. We first met our host Bruce and his wife Jeanie at the <a href="/articles/3732574">Flip Out festival</a> when they played with James Arthur&#8217;s Manhunt and both offered to put us up for our stay in Memphis.</p>
<p>Bruce and Jeanie&#8217;s place is cluttered with family heirlooms, life-size Jesus statues and a collection of doll-head sculptures. Amazing. We claim the back study as our room, appreciative to have a real house to settle into. Over the <a href="/news/4088110">Gonerfest</a> week their house would fill with at least 13 guests every night (including Aussies Zac Oblivian and Tim Scott), all graciously cooked for and treated like family.</p>
<p><strong>Day Eight:</strong></p>
<p>On our first day in Memphis we head straight to Goner Records to meet owners Zac and Eric who put us on the Gonerfest lineup and have supported our releases since day one. Eric&#8217;s daughter Anna provided a drawing of us for our Australian release of the LP, and it&#8217;s proudly pinned behind the counter. More record shopping takes place followed by a drop in to Beale street for voodoo candles.</p>
<p>After we cook Bruce and Jeanie some thank-you grub, we spend the night drinking whisky in the muggy heat and recording songs on the porch in a swinging bench. The neighbourhood cat keeps us company.</p>
<p><strong>Day Nine:</strong></p>
<p>Today is the first day of Gonerfest. Before it kicks off we explore the neighbourhood. Highlights include: a trip to the Peabody Hotel to watch the resident ducks waddle from their 5th floor home, down the elevator, through reception and into the lobby fountain (this has  been happening every day at 11am for the past 30 years); the awesome Sun Studios; and a stop at the Folklore Museum where we touch Aretha Franklin&#8217;s piano and meet the cheeriest, tiniest southern lady on the planet, who takes us to the rooftop to marvel at the views of her hometown.</p>
<p>We quickly realise Memphis is the bomb. Wide, dusty, desolate streets, an abandoned Pyramid on the skyline and the heartbeat of the blues still running through the town. That evening we further damage our arteries with the famous Gus&#8217;s Fried Chicken by the Mississippi River and then it&#8217;s off to the Hi Tone to watch Gonerfest&#8217;s opening night showcase. Spider Bags and Useless Eaters are our favourite acts.</p>

<p><strong>Day 10:</strong></p>
<p>Tonight we play Gonerfest. Holy hell! Being the first show we booked on our US tour we can&#8217;t actually believe the day has come. To celebrate, Bruce and Jeanie throw a BBQ feast for us Aussie style. An Australian invasion has gathered in Memphis and it&#8217;s nice to see some familiar faces, as well as meet other local bands and visitors from wider America.</p>
<p>Thee Oh Sees play an afternoon show in the searing heat outside Goner Records underneath a pergola. Once again they prove to us why they&#8217;re the fucking shit, and a band we utterly admire. The sun goes down and we head to the Hi Tone. The unruly combination of nerves and excitement hit us hard but thankfully result in a bolt of energy and it feels like a great show. A strong crowd really get into it and halfway through the set when we switch positions, Amy takes a photo of us both with the crowd cheering behind us. We&#8217;re stoked and on an absolute high. Still beaming, Hayley transforms into merch girl next to Ty Segall who dug our set and later played a killer set of his own.</p>
<p><strong>Day 11:</strong></p>
<p>To eradicate our unhealthy behaviour on tour so far, a bunch of us decide to get B12 injections to boost our stamina for the coming slew of Gonerfest events. Bandaids on arm, we enjoy the daytime events, in particular Golden Boys and Love Collector.</p>
<p>UV and TC arrive in town and play a house party in the early evening. We skip most of the party to finally have some time on our own. Head out to get some food and pass a guy reading the paper who does a double take and shouts, ?Hey I was just reading about you. You seen this?? He gives us copies of the paper with a review of our album to take home to our mums. Back at the Hi Tone, we watched Personal and the Pizzas and Strapping Fieldhands, but guiltily slink into the back office with the other Australians to watch the AFL Grand Final on the internet. Sad but true. We missed The Oblivians to absorb the game.</p>
<p><strong>Day 12:</strong></p>
<p>Todd from Hozac informs us our album has made the Top 10 in the nation-wide College Radio Charts. We&#8217;re all rapt and it&#8217;s a great way to start the day. And what better way to celebrate than head to Graceland to absorb the majestic dwelling and style of the King himself. Amy nearly has a cardiac arrest when she spots Elvis? bed on his private jet.</p>
<p>The next daytime event for Gonerfest was at the tiny Irish bar &#8220;Murphy&#8217;s&#8221;. By this stage the Gonerfest punters were looking weary. This was day four of an all-out boozefest of late nights and ringing eardrums. Perhaps we&#8217;re biased, but TC ruled this day. This was the first time we got to see our pals play in the States and we felt a ridiculous amount of pride watching our buddies own the stage. </p>
<blockquote><p>?Suddenly there were 20 people in the van all piled on top of gear and each other, all wasted, all grinning, all loud.?</p></blockquote>
<p>After hanging around in the sun to watch Golden Triangle and Lamps, a bunch of us follow Mikey on a leafy trek through Memphis side-streets on the hunt for catfish. As the followers thin out we enjoy a quite catch up with Mikey and Dan UV, swapping tales and smoked fish. These down moments prove to be really healing for our heads.</p>
<p>A few hours later and UV Race are on. The four of us march through the night back to the Hi Tone. An intrigued crowd is gathered for their show. Marcus and the gang play an entertaining, body-hugging set. After more beer and fun we split at 4am to rush home, pack and grab a 5.30am train to New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>Day 13:</strong></p>
<p>We arrive very early at the Memphis train station only to be severely harassed by the station staff, who tell us to compress our band gear and suitcases into a more manageable weight. After an all-nighter this task was all but impossible and after re-packing and re-weighing our suitcases four times were refused check-in and told to just try our luck at the carriage. A heated argument with the train conductor unfolded and Hayley accidentally drops the guitar case on his foot. This of course did not help the situation, and after much coaxing and bribing we lifted all our gear onto the top floor carriage bag by bag determined not to miss our train.</p>
<p>We finally collapse into our seats and try our hardest to keep our eyes open as the train leaves Memphis and we head off on the eight-hour train ride to New Orleans.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d both been looking forward to this train ride and in particular the glass carriage that allows 360 views of the swamplands, alligator marshes and hanging vine landscape. There&#8217;s nothing like steaming black coffee on a train. Especially when accompanied with a slightly mad train passenger who tells you about her series of books she&#8217;s written about a stinky sock puppet monkey. Apparently the sock puppet monkey was minding her seat on the carriage.</p>
