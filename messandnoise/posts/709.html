<p>The next day is Sunday and we head south with the last minute generous help of a lady named Natalie who borrows a car and happily drives us to the town of Lorient where we play a venue called Le Galion. The town is near a harbour and seems deserted. The bar is an old sailor&#8217;s bar and is decked out in a suitably nautical fashion. It looks ace. It&#8217;s also surrounded by deserted graffitied warehouses and you can hear the seabird screams echo about the place. Kind of eerie. Both the sound guy and the owner of Le Galion are total champs and we sit with the headline band, Henrys Funeral Shoe, smack bang in the middle of the dance floor and chow down while the punters watch, which is unusual. Henrys Funeral Shoe are from Wales. There&#8217;s an amazing difference in their demeanour in comparison to our often larger-than-life peers here. So down-to-earth and unassuming. It&#8217;s weird how those cultures beaten down by the commonwealth have an instant rapport. Pretty much every band that plays at Le Galion is of the garage variety but the audience is kind and the owner is especially effusive and keen to have us back and it is nice to play at a rock club.</p>
<p>Jared has come into the habit of repeating some of the things the Americans say but in a flat Australian accent. It&#8217;s an interesting experiment particularly in reference to some of the grand orations delivered by our favourite American, Porkchop. On the Monday night we play a town called Saint-Quay Portrieux. It&#8217;s another outdoor show on a hastily assembled stage supporting a US band called Left Lane Cruiser. They kind of seem like a cross between Willy Nelson and Metallica on first listen. The opening act is a local one man band called Chicken Diamond. He does a strange version of &#8216;TV Eye&#8217; and is the author of the song about his ?ding dong?. He does have quite a killer guitar tone though. Jared and Reuben begin musing charitably on the financial advantages of me touring Europe as a one-piece. Not the swimsuit kind but as a guy armed with a guitar, a kick drum, and maybe something else for my other foot. I can&#8217;t help but allow my mind to race forwards to one of my favourite pastimes. Coming up with band names. I suggest, ?Hot Dog Explosion?. It&#8217;s met with approval. Of course there&#8217;s always ?Jamie Hutchings and the Hot Dog Explosion?.</p>
<p>During our set I&#8217;ve been dragging out my Jazzmaster for the odd extended guitar wig-out which seems to satiate the French&#8217;s hunger for rock. In particular, we&#8217;ve been having our way with an extended version of the Bluebottle Kiss tune &#8216;Let the Termites Eat Our Riches&#8217;. While the original is fairly concise we now tend to bend and twist within its modal drone in whichever way we choose on the night. We do it again tonight and I am cornered by a female senior citizen who insists on knowing the name of this tune but still buys <em><a href="/releases/2000863">Avalon Cassettes</a></em>. The other major fan tonight is a girl of around 11 who chatters away enthusiastically in French. She proclaims the show ?superb? and is apparently known for haunting the local cinema in search of obscure art-house films. It&#8217;s a contrast from my mostly male, mostly IT industry-employed, though mostly very loyal crowd back home. Chicks dig us over here. But mostly chicks under 15 and over 60.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024401/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
A drama has unfolded over the past few days. Apparently at the finale of the festival&#8217;s celebrations some kind of altercation broke out between Ludo and our potential driver Jules. We hear it&#8217;s quite ugly and my professional discretion prevents me from going into all the details but our means of transport to Bordeaux is now hanging in the balance. We play a final show on a stationary boat harboured in St Brieux with the Heavies and Radio Moscow. Playing between these two hard rocking acts creates a particular friction between us and the crowd but it&#8217;s no bad thing to challenge a crowd every night. Why give these greedy punters what they want? We attempt to give them what we feel they require in this beautiful harbour setting. Some thank us, including two Australians who have driven a couple of hours to see us after spotting a poster. They are as surprised as I am to see me here.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3024400/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Thankfully, Jules comes on board for the drive as does his ultra-sweet girlfriend Fanny. Ludo also lends us his van and amp in a typical display of his limitless generosity. We love him. We are almost in Bordeaux when Jared makes the very reasonable suggestion of a toilet stop. Business done Jared climbs back into the car and steadies himself on the side of the front passenger door. At the same time Reubs slams the passenger door shut. On Jared&#8217;s fingers. There is a seemingly endless moment where Jared monotones, ?Reuben open the door. Reuben open the door?, before the penny drops. There are four massive creases on Jared&#8217;s fingers. Reubs and Fanny race into the servo to get ice but can only find a Calypso Ice Pop. After awhile Jared ends up eating it as it&#8217;s a fairly useless ice pack. In a supreme display of percussive machismo he manages to play the show anyway. We open for a stack of bands in a big outdoor square by the river in including the Heavies, Left Lane Cruiser and so forth. All the bands have breakfast together the next morning and we farewell them and Bordeaux and head down south towards Biarritz, this time with the mighty Porkchop in tow.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024402/432x768-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
On the way down, our driver Jules gets a call informing him that our first show in the Biarritz area, a place called Bayonne, has been cancelled. Apparently the bar owner has had a heart attack but on further investigation over the next couple of days it sounds more like a case of alcohol poisoning. Given we&#8217;ve played around 15 or 16 shows straight it&#8217;s not so bad. We go to the beach. We stay at a guy called Michell&#8217;s place. Him and his girlfriend are really lovely. Michell plays in a doom metal band called Monarch who have toured Australia. His left arm is tattooed black. We all sleep in the same room and Porkchop pretty much rips the roof of the place. I used to call my friend Justin ?the nasal orchestra? but he has some stiff competition now. When Porkchop asks if he snored last night Reubs denies hearing anything. Such a liar!</p>
<p>We follow the instructions regarding our next show and turn up at a car park on a beach opposite a bar/kiosk. We discover that yes indeed we are playing a car park at the beach tonight and assemble a PA, which is really just somebody&#8217;s hotted-up home hi-fi system. The barman is a bit of a boofhead and keeps trying to hurry us up while we try to make the PA sound less like a glorified practice amp. Reubs? bass ?rig? is an all in one combo made by an esteemed amplifier company called ?Gorilla?. This rig pretty much sounds like one long continual bowel movement. Typically Reub&#8217;s breezes through it uncomplainingly. Porkchop gets on with the show as always. Definitely one of the better one-man band proponents we&#8217;ve seen, and while he&#8217;s a prolific orator, his stories are mostly thoroughly entertaining. He tells me of the 90-year-old blues guitarist T-Model Ford asking if he could find a woman for him.</p>
<p>?What sort of a woman??<br/>
?I want a woman with no bones.?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also a walking encyclopedia of most musical genres and it&#8217;s great to be turned onto lots of stuff I&#8217;ve wanted to get into but now have further motivation to do so. We play our last show with Jared. It&#8217;s a strange gig to end on but I guess there&#8217;s worse places to play than a beachside car park in Biarritz. We stay in a flat above a school this time mostly with separate rooms. Porkchop&#8217;s nasal orchestra is more like a distant roar. It&#8217;s almost soothing. Like a distant roaring surf whispering to you from your bedroom window.</p>
<p>Our last show in France together is at a small bar in the town of Ciboure called ?Le Factory?. It&#8217;s outside. Porkchop soundchecks and then pretty much starts playing. The man is unstoppable and<br/>
we encore him onto a second set. The French have no issue with stopping and checking something out. If it appeals then they simply walk in, grab a beverage and sit themselves down. If they like it enough they&#8217;ll buy a CD. They make Aussies seem so self-conscious and stiff in comparison. </p>
<blockquote><p>?Chicks dig us over here. But mostly chicks under 15 and over 60.?</p></blockquote>
<p>We seem to be being fed in drinks tonight, and so we&#8217;re a little starved and overwatered during our set. It&#8217;s interesting reinterpreting the songs all of a sudden with just acoustic guitar and bass but I&#8217;m starting to feel a weird halo of depression floating around my head. I&#8217;m not a good-time musician and playing these shows to whoever is walking by or standing around is starting to make me wish for a trapdoor. I&#8217;d like to rid myself of it but it&#8217;s coming to the fore more and more. Porkchop adds a bit of harmonica to a couple of tunes but I screw up one of my tunings turning the final song into nonsense and I at least am keen to get off. Porkchop comes up for round three and then Cofi the owner asks Reubs and me if we&#8217;ll do another set. I oblige wanting to redeem myself somewhat. It&#8217;s a bit quieter now and everything seems to sit better. The songs from my last album <em><a href="/releases/2000280">His Imaginary Choir</a></em> especially seem to suit the acoustic and bass combo, and Reubs is starting to become quite the accomplished backing vocalist. Porkchop reckons he wants to cover the old Bluebottle Kiss song ?Let the Termites Eat Our Riches?. That I&#8217;d like to see.</p>
<p>Reubs and I spend the next day running after trains for 12 hours. There&#8217;s been some unfortunate Italian chaos meaning the cancellation of some of our Italian leg however our tickets are totally inflexible  so we have to hang around in Europe regardless. An old friend of ours called Jan and his wife Jasmine have invited us to stay with them for a few days in Switzerland to hang out and meet their newborn. When I wake up the next day in their loft I look out through the skylight and see a cat stalking imaginary prey under an endless blue sky. It&#8217;s so pretty I feel guilty. We spend the next three days in this state. Eating, drinking and swimming in the local river. Jan decides to take some time out to drive us to Italy and we can&#8217;t refuse this generous gesture. En route he buys the cheapest GPS he can find and it works well but no matter how many times I reprogram it into English the voice remains a hissing Fraulein. Often we will be in a meditative stupor cruising through the beautiful Swiss mountains without a care in the world only to have her hiss suddenly put an ice pick through everything. I can&#8217;t seem to adjust the volume either. We stop for petrol in Italy and the petrol attendant insists we owe him 95 euro despite the bowser clearly indicating we owe 78 euro. He tries his luck insistently hoping to take advantage of the language barrier but Jan stands his ground. I guess the GFC has settled in deep here.</p>
<p>We stay in a town called Marostica. It&#8217;s near 40 degrees and the next day we spend melting. It&#8217;s in the middle of the holidays and the town is totally ghosted in some kind of extended siesta. We soundcheck at the Rive Jazz Club outside and it sounds OK. People start turning up for dinner. We get a more than generous meal but pretty much after this, Gio &#8211; our effusive host &#8211; is run off her feet while Reubs, Jan and I sit nervously. Between us we&#8217;ve had around 18 espressos today so we&#8217;re a little edgy, dehydrated and too awkward to ask Gio for any further refreshments. When the time comes for Reubs and I to hit the tiles outside the sound has got a little farty. After some adjusting based on Jan&#8217;s sound opinions we soldier on. Breaking our set into two parts is not encouraged so we nervously plough through 20 songs. I really feel we&#8217;re just trying to play well tonight, not make mistakes, just try and play the tunes as best we can. The audience is polite enough but they&#8217;re here to graze so fair enough if they contain themselves. We don&#8217;t really connect with them tonight. We head back to the house Gio has kindly provided us and drown our sorrows in beer and our own sweat.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final chapter. It&#8217;s still roasting. We see a local kid stack his bike in slo-mo in the town square. He loses his footing on one pedal followed by the inevitable domino effect until he&#8217;s sprawled out bawling and roasting. It looks especially painful in the blinding heat. Tonight&#8217;s show is in a town called Pozzolengo. It&#8217;s apparently a festival called ?Castelli in Musica?. Music in the castle I think that means, which it kind of is. The town is deserted, in the middle of nowhere and even more roasting than Marostica. We eventually see a poster and wind our way up a tiny cobbled street towards a ruined castle surrounded by small apartments. </p>

<p/>
<p>I get out of the car and spy a small square littered with plastic seats with a tiny make shift stage assembled in front. There&#8217;s no one about and it looks like it&#8217;s set up for a local council meeting or graduation<br/>
ceremony. Eventually a couple of older guys turn up with a small PA system. Franco and Roberto. We get the sound happening and then go for pizza. Franco is dressed for a tennis match which is fair enough given the climate although he turns out to be a total music nerd after my own heart. He once owned a record store back in the late ?80s. He&#8217;s the president of the local blues society but pretty soon we&#8217;re talking about everything from Czech prog to the Fat Possum label and, of course &#8211; every older European music fan seems to know something of this &#8211; ?80s Australian garage.</p>
<p>We return to the square and pretty much every single seat is full. When I get to the front there is a sea of grey-haired, fan-wielding patrons. I guess this is a regular community concert that gets put on and they turn up loyally for whatever is on offer. The main thing being Celtic music. I imagine we were a hard sell but what else is new? Despite there being the odd walkout it goes well. We sing like The Everly Brothers and get all flamenco on a couple of tunes. Having an attentive audience does wonders for our performance. Franco gives a speech prior and post performance resplendent in his ?80s-influenced tennis gear and the president of the local music society speaks at length. He mentions Reuben a lot however the ?whys? and ?whats? of his address will remain forever a mystery. I sell a lot of CDs to this eclectic crowd  which is gratifying.</p>
<p>We head back to our sleepy hotel. Jan has loaded up on provisions and we crack a bottle of red with the help of a hunting knife Reubs has somehow procured off a friendly music loving policeman in France. He cuts some plastic water bottles in half to use for glasses and we have our three man barbarian soiree beneath the stars. For the next hour we feel really good.</p>
