                <h3>The son of legendary Olympian Shirley Strickland, Matthew de la Hunty has emerged from his mother&#8217;s imposing shadow to carve his own niche in Australia&#8217;s music scene. <strong>ANNE GRIFFIN-APPADOO</strong> catches up with the former Tall Tales and True frontman in his festive backyard in North Perth.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004397/440x325-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="325"/><br/>
Empty beer bottles and half-filled coffee cups lie scattered across the outdoor table. Tinsel flutters in the breeze. Considering the early hour, Matthew de la Hunty looks remarkably alert. His beloved Christmas lights, likely to remain in place indefinitely, rattle to the vibrations of his latest music project, The Smokin? Eldorados.</p>
<p>The son of Olympian Shirley Strickland, de la Hunty was never destined for a quiet life. But, rather than following in his mother&#8217;s lightening-quick footsteps, he wanted to carve out his own niche within Australia&#8217;s music scene.</p>
<p>In 1980 de la Hunty was a third-year medical student. Then, his father died.</p>
<p>?It was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back,? says de la Hunty quietly.</p>
<p>His father suffered a heart attack during a game of squash. It was a wake-up call for his son who realised ?life was finite? and he could no longer pretend to be someone he was not. De la Hunty made the unpopular decision to abandon his studies and become more involved in Perth&#8217;s underground rock scene. He had always enjoyed playing the guitar and describes Siouxsie and The Banshees? <em>The Scream</em> as having a huge impact on his life.</p>
<p>?It was so simple and raw and compelling,? de la Hunty says. ?It&#8217;s more about the ideas on that record than the skills of the musicians themselves. It&#8217;s all about writing songs. It&#8217;s not about being a great guitarist or anything else in particular.?</p>
<p>Lyrics and a feel for music are what drove a young de la Hunty to form a band with high-school buddy Martyn Casey. The band played a few shows in Melbourne but eventually fell apart. Casey, or &#8220;Marty&#8221; as de la Hunty affectionately calls him, went on to join Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004399/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="293"/><br/>
Not one to give up, de la Hunty relocated to Sydney in 1983 and formed his most successful outfit: Tall Tales and True. The trio &#8211; de la Hunty (vocals/guitar), Paul Miskin (bass) and Dave Rashleigh (drums) &#8211; toured and produced three albums over 12 years. ?We were travelling America and living the dream and we were going, ?Great, well we&#8217;ll be coming back here again&#8217;,? de la Hunty recalls. Sadly, it was to be the band&#8217;s last tour.</p>
<p>?You look back and at some points and think, ?Right, we&#8217;re on the road to somewhere?, and you don&#8217;t realise until later you&#8217;ve already been very privileged,? he says.</p>
<p>The mid-?90s was a difficult period for Tall Tales and True. After the release of their second album <em>Revenge</em> in 1992, they were increasingly under pressure to go mainstream.</p>
<p>?There was an awkward sense that people thought we could be like a hit band. It was just terrifying! We were quite happy to be a band with its own sort of sound,? de la Hunty says.</p>
<p>But the outward pressures combined with internal tensions within the band eventually forced Tall Tales and True to disband in 1995. The next few years were not easy for de la Hunty. His marriage to wife and band manager Jane fell apart and he found the isolation of losing both his wife and band difficult. From ARIA nominations and world-wide tours he was suddenly a part-time dad to his two sons Miles and Jean. He was also single and unemployed. ?It was a seven-year period of despair and pain and heartache,? he says.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was an awkward sense that people thought we could be like a hit band. It was just terrifying! We were quite happy to be a band with its own sort of sound.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While standing outside the school gates to pick up his sons, de la Hunty passed the time chatting to his friend Mia Matthews. One day, quite by chance, she revealed her love for the song ?Watching the Wind Blow?, which she first heard as a young mother trapped in an unhappy marriage. The sad, cryptic lyrics instantly resonated with the then 21-year-old, and many years later she would cite it as helping her summon the courage to leave her husband. She was shocked to discover the singer was de la Hunty. ?Is that you singing it? The song about topping yourself?!? she asked.</p>
<p>De la Hunty was amazed she ?got it?. Even his American producer had been clueless about the song&#8217;s true meaning. Matthews said she would have left her marriage regardless, but the song helped enormously.</p>
<p>?It was comforting, funny enough, motivating. I thought he had a fantastic voice. Watching the wind blow &#8211; I&#8217;d watched it a thousand times,? she says. Despite abandoning a career in medicine years earlier, de la Hunty discovered that through songs, he still had the ability to heal.</p>
<p>Friendship turned to romance and de la Hunty and Matthews have now been together for well over a decade. Matthews was by his side when de la Hunty began to surmount his depression. It was a surprise job offer that took his life in a new direction. He was offered the position of lecturer at Leederville TAFE in his native Perth, where he now teaches songwriting.</p>
<p>?I think they got me in because I had a whole career outside of Perth. I&#8217;ve done touring, negotiated publishing deals and done a lot of contracts &#8211; I think it&#8217;s pretty much the perfect job for me. Who could have imagined that such a job existed?? de la Hunty says.</p>
<p>But in 2004 another blow struck the de la Hunty family when Strickland passed away in strange circumstances in her Applecross home. De la Hunty had been close to his mother, accompanying her to international events that paid tribute to her contribution to Australian sport. ?To be in the Waldorf Astoria [in New York] and see pictures of my mum as a six-year-old running barefoot through the wheat-fields in Pithara, WA, in technicolour while they talked about what she&#8217;d managed to do from very humble beginnings &#8211; it was the world stage!? de la Hunty says.</p>
<p>He was there at the Sydney Olympics when his mother carried the torch, her name illuminated by yellow bulbs high above the stadium, and at her state funeral, the first held to honour the life of a private citizen in WA. Before Strickland&#8217;s death, the pair were interviewed together by Andrew Denton, but each for different reasons.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004398/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="293"/><br/>
Two years ago, de la Hunty met ARIA Hall of Fame inductee and founding member of The Hoodoo Gurus Roddy Radalj at a Christmas party in Perth. The pair began playing together and after a few months they decided to find a bass player. De la Hunty asked sound engineer and close friend Lorenzo Sinagra, &#8220;Laurie&#8221;, to learn the instrument in two weeks. Timothy Bates, one of de la Hunty&#8217;s former students, later joined on drums. Named after a song penned by Radalj, the band calls themselves the Smokin? Eldorados.</p>
<p>A far cry from the finely-crafted pop of Tall Tales and True, de la Hunty&#8217;s new band have a more informal way of writing tunes.?We take it in turns to add things,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We hit record and it stays on for the entire session. Everything we&#8217;ve recorded is live in the studio. Rod is making it up as he goes along.?</p>
<p>Live they tend to go with the flow. ?We&#8217;ve done a song for 40 minutes before &#8211; It&#8217;s always going to be kinda loose. And I think there&#8217;s something really exciting about knowing that something done for a certain gig is never going to be done again,? he says. ?Playing with the Eldorados had opened up a part of me that musically I had completely forgotten about.?</p>
<p>The Smokin? Eldorados have given de la Hunty a new lease on life. A few weeks ago he enlisted the help of his children for a tribute show. ?Life is full of surprises. If you&#8217;d told me that I&#8217;d be in a band with Rod on stage with my own children playing Triffids songs I would never have believed you!?</p>
<p>Still, the man behind such hits as ?Trust? and ?Summer of Love? is not one to Google himself. Here&#8217;s someone who forgets the name of his solo album (<em>Scissors, Paper, Rock*), neglects to mention that Richard Kingsmill once flew to Perth to interview him for *J-Files</em> and is astonished to discover there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to Tall Tales and True.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>The Smokin? Eldorados will launch their new single, ?Innocent Man?, on May 29 at Perth&#8217;s Hyde Park Hotel.</p>
