                <h3>Songs about New Zealand written in New York, takes on old ?60s R&amp;B and sex dreams involving Julian Assange &#8211; <strong>LIAM FINN</strong> talks his through his second album &#8216;FOMO&#8217; (Fear Of Missing Out). Full album stream below.

<h2>?Neurotic World?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3021482/440x392-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
One of the first songs I wrote for this record. I&#8217;ve always played a bit of piano but I haven&#8217;t always written songs on it. I&#8217;m not as not as good on it as I am on guitar, so it feels completely new to me. The lyrics definitely reflect how I was feeling after travelling for quite a few years, and everything being so vast and stimulating, and then coming back to New Zealand and living in a little beach house and waking up to the sound of the ocean. It made me realise how intense the last few years were, reflecting on relationships made and lost, and the idea of slowing down in such a neurotic time. It does feel like the world is bubbling right now in a very strange manner.</p>
<h2>?Don&#8217;t Even Know Your Name?</h2>
<p>This one was written on a baritone guitar in the wee small hours of the morning. A song about being fooled by body language, and the romantic lives we invent in split-second moments of attraction. I suppose ?love at first sight? would a simple way to describe that feeling but that&#8217;s too fairytale.</p>
<h2>?Roll of the Eye?</h2>
<p>I wrote that when I was in New York. A song about New Zealand, and the slightly claustrophobic nature of being there a long time. Because it&#8217;s such a small country, it just feels like everyone is so in tune with their surroundings and what everyone around thinks about them. Hence the opening lines about being crushed with a roll of the eye. I like getting out of my country, visiting Europe and America to perform, because I feel like I can be who I want to be, and that person is entertaining. If I act the same way in New Zealand, your friends are gonna be like, ?C&#8217;mon mate, pull your head in.? The song definitely reflects all that, but also my love for New Zealand and how beautiful it is. I&#8217;ll always come back to it.</p>
<h2>?Cold Feet?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never written with nostalgic ideas in mind, but I started playing that old ?60s R&amp;B-soul kind of strum and these chords that reminded me of a Tim Burton movie. I immediately thought the idea was cheesy and discarded it, but it kept sticking in my head. And it stayed there for a couple months, so I finally sat down and wrote the song. The song gave me an immediate summertime feeling, like at the end of a summer, when you&#8217;ve met someone on holiday and you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going to end up. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently entered into a new relationship that&#8217;s been the most amazing thing that I&#8217;ve ever felt, so I wanted to write something that told the story of that excitement when you first meet the person who makes you feel like you&#8217;ve never felt before.</p>

<h2>?Real Late?</h2>
<p>This one was written and recorded very late at night, on my eighth reel of tape. The drum loop was created using a drum kit covered in contact mics going through guitar amps. Glenn Kotche of Wilco is a master of this technique and spent a couple of days messing around in the studio with us while they were in town. He has an amazing knack for making unusual percussive noises and unique beats. The lyric is relatively simple, feeding again from those unusual late nights and difficult encounters.</p>
<h2>?The Struggle?</h2>
<p>This started off not-so-serious, as this Tom Waits kind of number; everything was distorted and disjointed and crusty. The vocal was an adlibbed rant about a dream I had where I sold my soul and had to have sex with Julian Assange on my birthday. I played it for Burke, and my girlfriend and my manager, and I thought it was a bit of a joke, but they all really liked it! Even after I cleaned it up a bit, I tried to get that same spirit into the vocal. Later I realised that rant means much more than I originally thought it did, to do with the struggle of making the record and being an artist and what you put yourself through to try and make something that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s easy to care too much about it, because it feels like it reflects you so much.</p>
<h2>?Little Words?</h2>
<p>This was written, and partly recorded, out at my little beach house in Piha quite early on in the creative process. I discarded it at first, and then in the last week of recording we came back to it and it sounded really beautiful and interesting, so we persevered. It carries that same atmosphere as ?Neurotic World? and I really wanted that colour to the record.</p>
<h2>?Reckless?</h2>
<p>A short song about how attractive recklessness seems sometimes. Being lead astray, going against your typically wussy-sensible ways and living dangerously. Sometimes self-destructiveness makes you feel rather alive. Plus, I got to play an awesomely ?90s guitar solo, which is always choice.</p>
<h2>?Chase The Seasons?</h2>
<p>This was written during the sessions for the 7 Worlds Collide charity album <em>The Sun Came Out</em> back in summer of 2009. A floppy song about coming home after gallivanting around the globe with my best friend. We recorded this one a bunch of times to get the right feel. And I got to do another guitar solo, which is only just hanging on, but that&#8217;s what I like about it!</p>
<h2>?Jump Your Bones?</h2>
<p>A joyous song and my favourite on the record. This one also uses one of Glenn Kotche&#8217;s contact mic beats. His beats were going through all my pedals, and I was manipulating as it went down. Then I added my own drums on top. This was the last song I finished on the record and it seemed well-suited to take the final spot in the track list, too.</p>
