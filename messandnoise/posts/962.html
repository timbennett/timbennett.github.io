Format, the Adelaide CBD&#8217;s last artist-run music venue, closes its doors at the end of this month. News of the closure broke at the same time as the state government announced they were installing a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-28/city-hub-for-budding-hotshots/4545230">Melbourne-based co-working hub</a> in the same building, along with start-up support in the order of <em>one million dollars</em>.</p>
<p>The outrage that followed sent shockwaves through the state government, putting Format&#8217;s collective of musicians, art-school kids and naive ?party-technicians? at the centre of an issue that has been simmering for the last year or so, and which may yet result in a seismic shift in the way state and local governments deal with Adelaide&#8217;s self-conscious lack of ?vibrancy.?</p>
<p>Format&#8217;s closing follows a <a href="http://driantoware.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/more-live-music-venues-than-ever-really/">steady decline in the number of live music venues in the Adelaide CBD</a>, particularly artist-run spaces. Last year the Jade Monkey shut due to construction of a hotel, late last year Higher Ground suffered insurmountable financial difficulties, and Tuxedo Cat will soon vacate their North Terrace venue after the building&#8217;s owners had a change of heart. By some small miracle, the decline in arts venues in Adelaide has been noted by state government, beginning last year with Premier Jay Weatherill&#8217;s promise to aid the Jade Monkey in finding a new home &#8211; a search that is yet to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Martin Elbourne, Adelaide&#8217;s current <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/meet-adelaides-new-musical-thinker-in-residence-martin-elbourne/story-fndo471r-1226465676294">Thinker in Residence</a> (a Rann initiative in the process of being phased out by the new Premier) started out working for Rough Trade, a post-punk record label that, in the late ?70s, bore a striking resemblance to the Format Zine Shop. Some have already speculated that Elbourne&#8217;s report on Adelaide&#8217;s live music industry will, among other things, highlight the lack of places where local artists can rehearse inside a rapidly gentrifying CBD.</p>
<p/>
<h2>A Brief History of Format</h2>
<p>Format Festival started back in 2008 by some zine nerds who wanted to run an event on the ?fringe? of the Fringe Festival. It quickly grew to include various DIY workshops, art installations and, auspiciously, a program of contemporary music.</p>
<p>In a conservative town where a 50-year-old arts festival and an <a href="/articles/3563554">annual car race</a> pass for a cultural landscape, the young folks often have to make their own fun. Format Festival was the result of a small group of bored youths securing a tiny amount of seed funding and a boarded-up shop front right in the heart of Adelaide&#8217;s vibrant stabbing and binge-drinking precinct.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q3mYNhfqQZk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Format Festival was one of the first places a young Stacey Wilson (Terrible Truths, Rites Wild, Regional Curse) played solo &#8211; at an exhibition curated by an equally young Celeste Aldahn, who went on to co-found DIY punk warehouse Animal House and play in goth-punk outfit <a href="http://ruleofthirds.bandcamp.com">Rule of Thirds</a>. A number of luminary artists and producers have left their fingerprints all over Format &#8211; former visual arts director Chloe Langford is a practising artist in Berlin, while Brigid Noone runs <a href="http://www.fontanelle.com.au">Fontanelle</a>, Adelaide&#8217;s largest artist-run gallery. Then there&#8217;s the overachieving founding director Dr Ianto Ware, former bass player in <a href="http://nothroughroad.bandcamp.com">No Through Road</a> and adviser to the Federal Arts Minister as Australia&#8217;s first <a href="http://www.minister.regional.gov.au/sc/releases/2013/january/sc003_2013.aspx">National Live Music Coordinator</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It can be a mildly apathetic town, so the beer prices were kept low and emphasis was placed on the development of a strong community of artists and patrons.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Ware&#8217;s experiment got out of control when Format Collective found a permanent venue, becoming a hybrid DIY arts ?hub? (?hub? being the buzzword local government in SA is particularly fond of these days; we think it means ?provider of wifi and couches?). There was a zine shop, a gallery for experimental and avant-garde visual art, a makeshift bar and a rotating coterie of artists, writers and hangers-on who would use the place to meet and plan. But it was the live music &#8211; and the attendant subculture &#8211; that paid most of the rent and kept the community invested in Format&#8217;s survival.</p>
<p>Format did its best to bring over bands it felt would otherwise struggle to get decent crowds in Adelaide. It can be a mildly apathetic town, so the beer prices were kept low and emphasis was placed on the development of a strong community of artists and patrons. Over the years Format&#8217;s basement has presented bands ranging from Thee Oh Sees, Slug Guts, Collarbones, Tiger Choir, Dick Diver, Twerps, Ghoul, Rat vs Possum, No Zu, Absolute Boys, Per Purpose, Alps, Making and so many more. We&#8217;re pretty sure they all had a good time. Sun Araw from Los Angeles even came twice, and are now selling the <a href="http://sunaraw.bandcamp.com/album/formatting-formants-adelaide-2012">recording</a> Format made for them.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/40800986?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Over time, Format&#8217;s resident sound tech grew bored with just recording shows, so Format established a makeshift recording studio in the basement. The first release was Terrible Truths&#8217;s <a href="http://terribletruths.bandcamp.com/album/terrible-truths-7-2011">self-titled 7?</a>, recorded over two days. Since then other local acts Swimming, Big Richard Insect, Gold Bloom, Wild Oats, and Old Mate have all recorded at Format. The basement is also shared as a rehearsal space between a number of bands, including Summer Flake, Sparkspitter, Steering By Stars, Avant Gardeners and Home for the Def.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Musicians never performed on elevated stages, and the organisers made sure everyone had a chance to dance to trashy R&amp;B till the cops showed up (and sometimes long after).?</p></blockquote>
<p>That basement also played host to Format&#8217;s live music program. A special relationship between the musicians and the crowd grew out of the blood, sweat and beers of that murky space. This was based on the fact that the place was run by a collective of artists with no financial interest beyond paying the rent vaguely on time. Musicians never performed on elevated stages, and the organisers made sure everyone had a chance to dance to trashy R&amp;B till the cops showed up (and sometimes long after). Running times were kept loose &#8211; touring acts played at their own convenience within lineups. All but the exit signs were <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/229721893839256/">handwritten</a>, the lighting carefully curated, and a taped-down handball court marked the front. Almost as soon as Format shows became a regular thing, patrons began gathering empties themselves, helping artists lug gear, running toilet paper and Berocca errands, keeping an eye out for the cops or the occasional dead-eyed stray from the harsh real world of Hindley Street binge culture (rest their souls).</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3ixm3FvXIPg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Which brings us to our present situation, marred by a new landlord who, without notice, began renovating the building around Format some eight months ago. Endless jackhammers, severed phone lines, falling debris, piles of rubble periodically blocking the bathroom &#8211; with little offered in the way of explanation, let alone compensation. Pretty soon it became clear that Format was not part of the developer&#8217;s plan for a gentrified Peel Street. The collective began seeking advice and support from both the public and private sector, which has been a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>When it was revealed that the jackhammers would only cease when the million-dollar hub for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-28/city-hub-for-budding-hotshots/4545230">?young entrepreneurs?</a> was installed in the same building, a social media storm erupted. In the wake of all this anger &#8211; much of it misdirected towards well-meaning public servants and a caught-in-the-middle group of clean-cut start-up nerds &#8211; the government is starting to listen. If all goes well, Adelaide&#8217;s live music scene might enjoy the same level of support and respect as any other serious small business sector.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h2PTlIZqI1s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>The search for a new venue has taken up a lot of Format&#8217;s time over the past few months, not least due to rising rents in the CBD, an exodus of skills and talent, the slow pace of liquor licensing and compliance reform and the rising number of residents living close to entertainment venues. It can be a depressing, disaffecting uphill climb, but it&#8217;s always been that way and Format has always won.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Format Always Wins</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Format has to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=QavFlUyaPfY">party to survive</a>. After months of suffocating dust and construction noise, the Collective&#8217;s coffers are empty and there&#8217;s still two months? rent and a moving truck to pay for. Over the coming Easter weekend, Format will host a two-day party on Peel St, codenamed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/397447653684604">Format Always Wins</a>. Terrible Truths will return from Melbourne, Marcus Whale from Collarbones is putting together a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Black-Vanilla/229174150463502">Black Vanilla</a> show and a couple dozen of Format&#8217;s favourite artists will gather to say goodbye to the place. </p>

<p/>
<p>Format Always Wins is a two-day microcosm of what Format has achieved over the last five years &#8211; and a show of force on behalf of a creative community that is only just starting to add its voice to a conversation that Adelaide has been having with itself since the closure of the Jade Monkey, and which had until recently been repeating the same old ?vibrancy-by-numbers? platitudes.</p>
<p>Format will always win. Even if it doesn&#8217;t, some other crew of slacker nerds will put their hands up to support Adelaide&#8217;s surprisingly resilient underground. Either way, the near-death of Format is as good an excuse as any to buy a pallet of beer on credit and wheel a PA out onto the street.</p>

<p>####<a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/397447653684604">Format Always Wins</a> runs Saturday, March 30 and Sunday, March 31 on Peel Street in Adelaide, featuring 18 bands over two days. For more information on Format, visit their <a href="http://format.net.au">website</a>.</p>
