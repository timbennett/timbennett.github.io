<h2>?Blunt Eyes?  </h2>
<p>Per: I have no idea how this song came to be. It&#8217;s as if the song was the soundtrack to the recording of the album, and someone accidentally tacked it on. I remember picking up Jensen [Tjhung, bass] on my way to the studio, and he dropping me off in a ska nightmare. I also remember Duncan looking like he was about to pull up a chair and destroy a bowl of popcorn. He must have had a plan.</p>
<p>Duncan: I love having conceptual frameworks around a body of work, but that&#8217;s not what this is about. It&#8217;s a simple outlet for free/noise/rock ?n? roll life enhancement. <em><a href="/news/4556101">Future Eaters</a>*, our first album, saw collaboration creeping in but *Biker* is truly the sum of its parts. The material developed over the course of a few months, haphazardly documenting loose ideas and improvised pieces. Punishing. But the album&#8217;s recording session came at a crucial time and was done in one day: Jensen was about to spend several months in China on an artist residency &#8211; we had some momentum and musical connexion but it was fragile enough to disintegrate with an extended hiatus. I sifted through all the roughs and pieced together sections of what I thought might work as an album. We reinterpreted a few of those ideas, pretty much on the fly, when we recorded them for *Biker</em>. I can&#8217;t remember where the music for ?Blunt Eyes? came from. But if you listen closely at the end of the song, you&#8217;ll hear Per screaming. It&#8217;s a punishing beat to play and by the third take he&#8217;d been steamrolling it for 20 minutes; his arms were about to melt. First song of the day.</p>

<h2>?Haus Flipper?  </h2>
<p>Per: The music on this album was recorded in one day &#8211; live with no overdubs. The vocals, however, is the tale of a man nearly losing his mind in endless solitary alcohol-fuelled sessions in a converted industrial lot in Reservoir. Weird shit always seemed to happen at this arse-end. Stray untethered German Shepherds would roam the estate, men sitting frozen in their cars with the lights off only to speed off abruptly, hurried loadings of weird equipment under MCG-strength floodlights. It&#8217;s a fucking weird place. Jensen and I didn&#8217;t hear any vocals for weeks. The first take that was presented to us was the sound of bad mongo under the stairs on a rum bender. And this was THE take, according to Duncan. I was bewildered, and not exactly sold. After convincing Duncan to do some more takes, I finally saw the error in my judgment, and conceded &#8211; yep, it&#8217;s epic retardation. Grand even. Then of course Duncan changed his mind and redid all of the vocals in the demented thug-croon style that we&#8217;ve all come to love. The original vocal take on this song was the crowning jewel of the Quasimodo on spring break style. Don&#8217;t worry, I have the original file. Fuhhhruhhhrghh.</p>
<p>Duncan: Lyrically, it&#8217;s about taking great pleasure in watching someone eating their own words. That, and a strange desire to destroy everything good in your own life.</p>

<h2>?Silver Fog?  </h2>
<p>Per: As one of the two dads in the band, I find this song as being a fairly successful attempt at conveying the notion of the absurdity of being a father. Relentless grind or harmonic mantra? I remember the time when my then infant son took a sneaky shit on the change table, and I had no other choice than to catch it with my hand. The sudden shock and horror of holding a steaming log, followed by almost collapsing with laughter due to the ridiculous situation. Silver Log.</p>
<p>Duncan: At the age of 13, I took a near lethal dose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura">datura</a> and was left tripping balls for months. I remember walking to the supermarket to buy ice cream when I left my body. Watching myself move was really strange: autopilot, total depersonalisation, android malfunction. I often tap into lost memories when I sing and this one came to the surface. The lyrics later shifted towards general work-day experiences: sardine-tin public transport claustrophobia, no room to live. As I walked from the train to work, a chromer huddled in a pile of clothes near the footpath &#8211; silver face and eyes grinning wildly &#8211; shouted ?GOOD MORNING? from behind their plastic bag. I felt an almost instantaneous self-disgust for averting my eyes, rather than engaging like a human being. When we recorded this, my twin girls were under two years old and I&#8217;d often find my shining moment of daily freedom was picking up milk on the way home. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=nYYTLJ8YHi4">?Under My Thumb?</a> was playing at the supermarket. I tried to learn the bass line, mangled about three notes and played it on repeat. Jensen stripped it back even further. The lyrics eventually ended up being about reincarnation &#8211; staying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">Bardo</a> as long as you can.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3583544304/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=4269143041/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://exhaustion.bandcamp.com/album/biker">Biker by EXHAUSTION</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Twin Lights?  </h2>
<p>Per: When Duncan and Jensen first started fucking around with freeform music, I felt out of my depth. The former had studied it by turning over the right stones, and the latter is the embodiment of all things instinctive. I was just a self-taught self-conscious rock drummer from one of the most uptight countries in the world (SWE). Halfway through this session I gave up, and Jensen approached the drum kit looking like a Powerball winner. Fuelled by his inspired performance on the drums, I started banging this rusty old metal rod I found outside the Hell&#8217;s Angels clubhouse. The rest is, as they say, EDITING! Duncan is the pig in the mud.</p>
<p>Duncan: An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music">aleatoric</a> diet of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=AFp73sqwNfU">?L.A Blues?</a>, Keiji Haino and free jazz. I couldn&#8217;t convince Rich [Stanley from Aarght Records] to release a double album, so took an axe to it. Exhaustion was meant to be a rock ?n? roll band, but improv has crept in like a virus.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3583544304/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2068038262/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://exhaustion.bandcamp.com/album/biker">Biker by EXHAUSTION</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Pure Duty?  </h2>
<p>Per: Taste the metal. If you bang metal hard enough, you can feel it in your bones and joints. It reverberates through your jaw, teeth, and your entire skull. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.M._Einheit">F.M. Einheit</a>, Neubauten&#8217;s legendary percussionist, wore out his body during his stint in the band. Two years in Exhaustion is starting to take its toll. For me this song reminds me of a tale of Duncan going on an evening kebab crawl in northeast suburbia. There&#8217;s a servo up there sporting a ?Welcome to Preston? neon sign. Across the road seagulls, late-night gluttons and bad parkers engage in a vicious dance at the local kebab shack. This is where we celebrated after finishing the recording of the album. I accidentally ate some of the tinfoil kebab wrapping. Jensen left for China shortly after this. It was bittersweet, and so is the song. I had the taste of tinfoil stuck in my mouth for days, and in winter I can&#8217;t feel my fingers. Watch what you eat, and watch what you play.</p>
<p>Duncan: I ruined what could have been our pop hit by drawling about the futility of prole life in our imploding world, and buying into the dream but failing to psychologically assimilate. Jensen brought this bass line to the table. On the day, we ran through a few versions, quiet and clean, then we blasted this version out and it stuck.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Hard Left?  </h2>
<p>Per: Improv piece propelled by Jensen&#8217;s leviathan bass playing. I made a metal percussion bed out of steel grating with loose screws attached. It also featured several saucepan lids that I had to sneak out of the kitchen. It&#8217;s hard to drain pasta without lids. The kids? dinner was overcooked that night. It will toughen them up, right? After hearing a solo piano album that Duncan recorded, I asked him, ?I didn&#8217;t know that you could play the piano?? He answered drolly: ?I don&#8217;t. Those things practically play themselves.?</p>
<p>Duncan: The title and some of the lyrics are a reference to Bruce Russell&#8217;s excellent book, <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8065476-left-handed-blows">Left-Handed Blows: Writing on Sound 1993 &#8211; 2009</a></em>, and by extension, Walter Benjamin, the German philosopher he quotes from: ?These are days when no one should rely unduly on his ?competence?. Strength lies in improvisation. All the decisive blows are struck left-handed.? There&#8217;s the obvious political implications too; as our government veers to the extreme Right we&#8217;re facing troubling times. Just days after deciding on the title, a colleague was called ?Hard Left? by the Institute of Public Affairs, the right-wing think tank instrumental in proposing so many of the harsh measures our current government has adopted.</p>

<h2>?Lonely Cars?  </h2>
<p>Duncan: On the joys of a dead-eyed commute between dual destinations of endless work, the search for escape amongst horrors formerly considered recreation, and the inevitable return to a quiet street lined by destroyed lives.</p>
<p>Per: As the recording day wore on, we started to deflate. We did what any hard-living pub-psych band would do. We hit the energy drinks. We juiced hard. We weren&#8217;t prepared for what followed. Hard gritty energy hitting the lobe and awakening dormant pubescent memories of cutting sick on homemade cherry wine, inevitable rejection and throwing up at 3am in the neighbours? rhododendron garden. The recording of this song is a blur, and would be effectively depicted by <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71pDyrfi62L.<em>SL1425</em>.jpg">the album cover</a> of Nickelback&#8217;s 2005 effort <em>All the Right Reasons</em>. You don&#8217;t know where the souped-up Chevy is going, but you know it&#8217;s going to crash. Just like Chad and Avril&#8217;s marriage. Thousands of lonely cars, millions of broken hearts.</p>
