                <h3>Has Harvest Festival gotten over its first-year teething problems? <strong>DOUG WALLEN<em>*, **EDWARD SHARP-PAUL** and **DARREN LEVIN** report from the Melbourne leg of the event at Werribee Park yesterday (November 11). Photos by *</em>KATIE FAIRSERVICE</strong>.
</h3>
<p>Harvest&#8217;s Melbourne return over the weekend can be summed up in a single word: Redemption. Last year&#8217;s teething problems &#8211; huge queues for just about everything, a beer shortage, a <a href="/news/4370399">flawed drink token system</a>, <a href="/news/4368548">transport dilemmas</a> and a shortened headline set by The Flaming Lips &#8211; weren&#8217;t ironed out as much as eradicated.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t look promising early on. After a decent run on the freeway, punters faced waits of up to 45 minutes (about three quarters of the distance from Melbourne to Werribee Park) to get inside the festival grounds. Once inside, however, gridlock concerns all but dissipated under blue skies, stress-free conditions and a relaxed atmosphere. Much of that had to do with spreading the festival out over two days: a mere 4000 people on the Saturday and a manageable 12,000 on the Sunday according to bar staff. The heavy traffic was repeated at the end of the festival, however, with cancelled trains (due to a line upgrade) forcing many punters to drive, charter busses, hire limos or take the free bus option to Flinders Street.</p>

<p>Once again, the action was split across three stages: The Great Lawn (the one with the illuminated mansion as a backdrop); the smaller Big Red Tractor Stage and the unshaded Windmill Stage, which rivalled Meredith&#8217;s Supernatural Atmosphere in the dustbowl stakes. Meanwhile, there was a whole bunch of vaudevillian activity taking place at Bootleg Alley: bands playing Irish jigs on the roof of a caf? called ?La Toosh?, amateur theatre to rival Dexys (see below) and even cabaret versions of ?Gin and Juice?. </p>
<p>Disappointingly, only two of the 23 bands on the bill are based in Australia &#8211; Geelong&#8217;s The Murlocs and Sydney&#8217;s Winter People &#8211; with The Liars? Angus Andrew and <a href="/articles/4182020">permanent resident</a> Brent DeBoer (The Dandy Warhols) bumping up the Aus contingent ever so slightly. Should local content quotas apply to festivals, too?</p>

<h2>The bands?</h2>
<p>Doug Wallen: On first at the Great Lawn stage, <strong>Winter People</strong> have way too much bass in their mix for a indie-folk act with two violins. The Sydney band include ?Time Out of Mind?, from their recent <em>A Year At Sea</em>, a song that was cut for time from their Saturday set. As on record, though, these guys have trouble distinguishing themselves from every other band with folk influences and nautical themes.</p>
<p>Unravelling their songs even as they play them, Philadelphia&#8217;s <strong>The War On Drugs</strong> lodge Adam Granduciel&#8217;s big-sky Tom Petty and Dylan-isms in great, droning, ambient-edged jams. This set is an unflustered and meditative one, even given the enthusiasm of drummer Patrick Berkery (Danielson, Pernice Brothers). That makes sense for a band that have very gradually made themselves known around the world. Their older tune ?Arms Like Boulders? is a perfect example of their rambling, open-highway charm, casting words and sounds into the ether.</p>
<p>Wales? <strong>Los Campesinos!</strong> have transitioned over the years from wordy, shouty, boisterous indie rock to something closer to wordy, shouty, boisterous pop-punk (or even post-hardcore). Whatever you call it, it wilts in the sun here.</p>
<p>Decked out in braces and berets, the men of <strong>Dexys</strong> look like dandyish street urchins. That includes resident genius Kevin Rowland, who shares vocal duties and mid-song skits with Pete Williams and duet partner Madeleine Hyland. As counterprogramming this is pretty ideal, but the set is heavy on the new comeback album (<em>One Day I&#8217;m Going to Soar</em>) and light on the classic ?80s records. ?Come On Eileen? does get an airing, right around the middle, with an extended version that gets the modest crowd dancing &#8211; if mostly just for the chorus. It&#8217;s a funny song: more of a fleeting, rabble-rousing peak than the isolated and prolonged moments of emotional revelation that other Dexys songs hinge on (especially on the new album). Rowland&#8217;s voice is still very near to pristine, floating beautifully with the fiddle, trombone and other arrangements. This is practically a musical revue, but Dexys remain thinking person&#8217;s pop.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3032438/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>What would you expect of <strong>Liars</strong> but seamless shape-shifting? Starting out as convulsive, industrial synth-pop, the suited trio end up urgently punk-y (?Plaster Casts of Everything?) before closing with a woozy ballad that Angus Andrew said they only play when they&#8217;re in Melbourne. In between, they periodically rediscover guitar, bass and live drums, blurring their many unique eras into a winning streak of dissonant pop. Everything is up for grabs, including ?We Fenced Other Gardens with the Bones of Our Own? from 2004?s <em>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</em>. Out of the heavy sun and under this tented stage, it&#8217;s like the rest of the festival isn&#8217;t even happening. This is our dark, weird, little oasis, the same one that will later host Chromatics and Fuck Buttons. </p>
<p>Austin band <strong>The Black Angels</strong> do dub-y, drone-y psych rock that seems to bring absolutely nothing new to the table. The crowd loves it and knows the songs, but the whole time I just wish I was watching New War instead: a band with a lot of the same impulses, but without such reliance on rock ?n? roll clich&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong> are Cake: funk guitar breaks, Mariachi horns, talk-singing, the lot. I catch two songs: the country-ish old number ?Stickshifts and Safetybelts? and the last album&#8217;s unsurprising ?Mustache Man (Wasted)?. Frontman John McCrea likes to rant whenever he can, but his speech about a punter that should experience the band rather than filming it finds vocal support from the audience.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3032434/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Edward Sharp Paul: <strong>Mondo Cane</strong> are an unusual spectacle even by Mike Patton&#8217;s standards. Their orchestral Italian pop is lush, raucous and just a little bit silly, delivered with Patton&#8217;s trademark combination of humour and maniacal intensity. Though it stomps along that fine line between homage and parody, the Mondo Cane experience probably features the finest musicianship of the day, not to mention a crazy theremin player with silver lambchops. This, apparently, isn&#8217;t enough for those that migrated towards Silversun Pickups as the set wore on.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3032430/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>DW: Whether you attribute it to Zach Condon&#8217;s professed jetlag or just the nature of the band&#8217;s music, <strong>Beirut</strong> don&#8217;t exactly break out. But I enjoy their set more than I have any of their records, relishing the bright presence of piano and horns in place of guitar (I&#8217;m not counting the six-string tenor ukulele). That includes Condon&#8217;s devoted trumpeting; he even has a bugle tattooed on his wrist. It&#8217;s a fairly samey set, but so light and airy and easily attuned to the afternoon sun.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3032433/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>DW: <strong>Chromatics</strong> should have headlined this thing. They&#8217;re that transfixing, even during the instrumental opener before mirage-voiced Ruth Radelet takes the stage. Then again, it&#8217;s so perfect in this tent: put it on the lawn stage, even at night, and we&#8217;d all be staring at video screens and light shows instead of watching this band at work up close. Next to Beck this is my highlight, and a new high-water mark for seeing full-band electronic music performed live.</p>
<p><strong>Beck</strong>?s first three songs are: ?Devil&#8217;s Haircut?, ?One Foot in the Grave?, ?Loser?. There&#8217;s no holding off on hits or avoiding obscure gems: just an incredibly well-oiled band and its cruisey leader knocking out song after song with little interruption. It being Beck, just about every song is constantly in flux, sneaking in peripheral quirks and cross-genre asides. The set&#8217;s like that too, slipping between albums and eras, though with more a full-band rock/blues feel than I&#8217;d been expecting. His hour-plus, near-sunset slot slows down two-thirds of the way through with a string of country-ish tunes (including the great ?Lost Cause?), but I&#8217;m not tempted to walk away for a second. Looking like he&#8217;s aged maybe a year over the past couple decades, Beck makes easy-going jokes about ?80s guitar solos, Sigur Ros and stone-washed jeans. It&#8217;s effortless, in the best possible way. Second to last comes ?Gamma Ray? &#8211; much stronger than on record &#8211; and the obligatory ?Where&#8217;s It At?, which proves a better memory than song but is still hugely likeable. And so is Beck: totally professional and <em>on</em>, just doin? his thing.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3032435/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>ESP: Later on The Great Lawn, Sigur R&#8217;s started with ?Glossoli?: a slow, gentle chord progression, bowed guitar, Jonsi Birgisson&#8217;s otherworldly voice, climax, sheer catharsis, absolute control. ?Svefn-G-Englar? from 1999?s <em>?g&#8217;tis byrjun</em> was possibly better &#8211; amid the abstract visuals and the ghostly backlit pines, time seemed to stand still for a moment. Augmented here and there by strings and horns, Sigur R&#8217;s hushed the day&#8217;s largest audience with a display of effortless power.</p>

<p>And rinse, and repeat. Sigur R&#8217;s may have a formula, but it&#8217;s a great formula. Similarly, their set might&#8217;ve wanted for spontaneity, but few cared, bathed as they were in the cinematic glow of a truly great band. It was a beautiful way to end a successful day, and it just about softened the frustration of the <em>Escape From Alcatraz</em> -style clusterfuck that was the return trip to Melbourne.</p>
<p>DW: <strong>Fuck Buttons</strong> supply credibility, and again some well-placed counterprogramming. The chunk I catch is piercingly melodic and surprisingly dance-y, albeit with the intense repetition that tells you it&#8217;s still Fuck Buttons.</p>
<p>Starting late, <strong>Santigold</strong> harnesses the last bit of energy anyone has left. It&#8217;s an almost blinding setup of stage lights, Devo-looking backing trio and twin dancers, the latter flashing eye-popping green and other colours alongside dynamic Santi White. ?L.E.S. Artistes? sounds as good as ever, and second-album fare like ?The Keepers? fits right in. Where Sigur Ros is all majesty and build, this is lean, tight, downright aerobic pop music, with the smarts of post-punk and New Wave.</p>
