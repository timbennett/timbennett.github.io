<h2>?Immersion II?  </h2>
<p>Tom: This track is a version of one of the earliest songs we wrote, while Steve and I were still at RMIT studying Fine Art in Sound (ha ha, true though). The original version was over 10 minutes long. One of the proudest moments in my undergrad was playing that bass-heavy mess at top volume in our crit class. This version is not the same song, but a version of the same ideas. A good look at how we started, I think.</p>
<p>Steven: Haha, yes, this is true, I was in the same class with Tom the day we subjected everyone to over 10 minutes of bass, which I think, from memory, was the kick drum with the decay opened up? There was also an ?Immersion? 1.2 (live), which appeared on a compilation given away at Miles Brown&#8217;s Science Club (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=gOE3ap9C6ZI">Chemistry</a>) gig on the night we played. That had more of a sequenced bass line using a Voice of Saturn sequencer I used in the early days of Nun, but that&#8217;s packed it in now. So this is a more ?streamlined? version, which works great as a moody album opener building up intensity and setting the mood.</p>
<p>Jenny: I felt like an impostor being there at RMIT &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of a novelty to be in any educational institution if you are not meant to be. Definitely not a novelty, I guess, when you have to be there. I remember loving playing with the Space Echo and warping out the vocal lines of that one &#8211; I just wanted it to sound horrible. That heavy bass is heaven.</p>
<p>Hugh: Slow-mo punching in the guts.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1112842590/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Evoke the Sleep?  </h2>
<p>Tom: When we first wrote this in practice, I remember wondering if my part (the synth octave) was too much of a rip-off of <a href="/releases/2000642">Chrome Dome</a> (and not to mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Normal">The Normal</a>). I guess we decided it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Steven: Funnily enough, this one originally started out as an ode to John Carpenter. I was experimenting with syncing up the drum machine with all these other gadgets, and played a similar pattern to something from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape<em>from</em>New_York ">Escape from New York</a></em>. It&#8217;s essentially the same now but sped up and with everyone else&#8217;s parts on top cementing it into a much more solid danceable tune, as opposed to a soundtrack to post-apocalyptic New York.</p>
<p>Jenny: That one wrote itself almost instantly. I had short rhythmic lyrics, half written, outlaying a sensation of panic &#8211; where you are trying to grasp something tangible in a future fiction world &#8211; losing the essence of self to the shadow of yourself. ?Evoke the Sleep? is the age-old story of industry/social structures and constructs (the greater forces) encroaching on the human spirit, producing an involuntary sleep. Friends have said to us that this is a good song to drive to &#8211; I can&#8217;t drive (I would kill people) but I could imagine the feeling of motion adding to this one.</p>
<p>Hugh: I literally just add pew-pew sounds to this.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2831670004/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Kino?  </h2>
<p>Tom: Steve and I wrote this one in about 30 minutes to perform, as a duo at, our university grad show in 2011. I wrote the lyrics while we ate pies on Swanston St. It was a really badly written piece of speculative fiction about a future in which, due to corporate greed and censorship gone mad, all the films being produced were feature-length cola ads. It was awful, but there was so much delay on my voice it didn&#8217;t matter so much. The lyrics, thank gawd, have since been reworked by Jen.</p>
<p>Steven: Yes, that was my first ever actual live performance too! &#8211; And I was on so many cold and flu drugs that I&#8217;m not sure if it was even a performance on my part (I had a cold, by the way). Those were tasty pies though! I really like what this song has become: the structure was always there [but] now it has become fully fleshed out, and I love the way it just turns into noise whilst still maintaining melody at the end.</p>
<p>Jenny: Future fiction still prevailed for this one though. I love this song; it is ominous, yet there is a strangely reassuring tone to it.</p>
<p>Hugh: I used to work at a cinema and didn&#8217;t think enough about these consumerist themes. To me this has the most sci-fi credentials in sound, but obviously in lyrics too. ?Plates initiate? &#8211; great writing from Jen.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=3751656258/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Suppress Electricity?  </h2>
<p>Jenny: This is a sharp-shoulder-shake and singing-into-a-hairbrush-in-the-mirror type of song. I remember going over to Steve&#8217;s house and sitting with him and Hugh while trying to quietly do a rough take of the lyrics so I wouldn&#8217;t wake up his flatmates. It&#8217;s a weird, broken-hearts-club, love song with the kind of embarrassing desperation only romance can produce; grandiose statements to your lost love about all the grand gestures you would do for them if you were together again &#8211; like suppressing electricity, which I imagine would be quite difficult unless you were Margaret Thatcher*.<br/>
(* This was written before MT died and is by no means a pro MT song.)</p>
<p>Steven: I&#8217;m so glad this song came together like it did &#8211; probably one of our least played live songs, so it is still quite fresh in terms of structure. Love the sentiment in the lyrics, as we do appear to be heading into a state of neo-Thatcher-like ideology.</p>
<p>Jenny: Live, if the DR-55 (the drum machine) comes in at the wrong speed on this one, it turns into a UB40-eque reggae jam. Awkward for everyone involved?</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=533659878/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Subway?  </h2>
<p>Tom: When we recorded this one, we were having heaps of trouble with the transition between the two parts; it was either too much of a jump or not enough of a jump. As is often the case, the answer was heaven sent from Madonna herself &#8211; taking a cue from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=rSaC-YbSDpo&amp;">?Borderline?</a>, we added in the hi-hat on the quarter beat. It was one of those ?aha? moments in mixing. Also features around five or six layers of Hugh by the time it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>Jenny: It is a prog-rock anthem &#8211; ha ha. That change always makes me laugh a little because it is so pronounced and a bit ridiculous. Kind of like a late Cher key change or something. I wrote those lyrics when I was in transit on a visit back to Dublin &#8211; literal, in a way. More Hugh please.</p>
<p>Steven: More Hugh!</p>
<p>Hugh: I just kept hearing another melody or string line on the <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/jx3p.php">JX-3P</a> that could go in there. Reckon I coulda done three more layers!</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1640105454/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Uri Geller?  </h2>
<p>Steven: A song about the psychic phenomenon of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ycE863jRA9Q">spoon bending</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny: I thought Uri Geller was actually magic when I was a kid and 100% reputable. After all, he was endorsed by MJ, Minnelli and Alice Cooper. I was thinking a lot about the everyday sense of magic that you can experience, like the occasional gigantic kinetic energetic pulls you have towards other people &#8211; I think that is magic.</p>
<p>Hugh: My favourite drum rhythm from Steve. I think everything relates well and locks in at points while still sounding loose. Live synth playing will always add to that to a synth project.</p>
<p>Tom: I thought I was ripping off <a href="/articles/3732190">Repairs</a> when I wrote that bass line?</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1973999547/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=4153899460/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://xxxnunxxx.bandcamp.com/album/nun">Nun by Nun</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Cronenberg?  </h2>
<p>Tom: That jump to a major key at the end is so stupid. I love it.</p>
<p>Steven: One of our first songs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cronenberg">Great director</a>. I think it was ?Cronenberg?, ?Kino? and ?Immersion? that got us going in the early days. Re-recorded for the album with some extra bells and whistles thrown in.</p>
<p>Jenny: My bad attempt at Jonathan Richman-style phrasing: Modern Lovers and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=M6AXQeCE9Rw">Videodrome</a></em>?</p>
<p>Hugh: Funnily enough, I think J-Rich singing about Cronenberg could totally happen. Cynicism ensues. This song has videogame-ish qualities, I think. ?Level complete? is obviously the ending. TRIUMPH!</p>

<h2>?Lost Souls?  </h2>
<p>Tom: This is another track from the undergrad days but, unlike the others, this is the actual version we recorded back then. Steve used some kind of therapeutic sleep machine to make those ocean sounds, and those moaning noises were an old Roland System 100. A majestic piece of engineering, that machine &#8211; visually and functionally. I&#8217;d love to own one, one day. There&#8217;s a playful quality to those bouncy sounds in this track that I really love.</p>
<p>Steven: I still have that therapeutic sleep machine; it&#8217;s basically an analog white-noise generator (waves, rain, etc.). It looks great, though the power supply for it melted during that recording. I must get another one. A sort of pause-for-quiet-reflection track. I do like where this takes you.</p>
<p>Jenny: Ha! Yes, another RMIT room one &#8211; I love that sleep machine, Steve. There was no need to add a voice to that sound &#8211; more Nun sleep sedation (I just realised the thematic link as I type). </p>
<p>Hugh: A singular heart beating in a fish bowl. Its owner moaning from the outside through the glass.</p>

<h2>?Terrormaze?  </h2>
<p>Steven: Straight-ahead synth-punk stylings. Such a simple song and structure, no fuss &#8211; but in saying that, it did take a while to get this one right. It&#8217;s the simple ones that sometimes prove difficult.</p>
<p>Jenny: Yes, lots of mixing! Obsessing over the drums.</p>
<p>Tom: The mix of this one didn&#8217;t sit well with me until after it was mastered, when it all seemed to come together. Yeah, mixing the drums on this was hell. A case of too high or too low, no matter what we did. Reminds me of the sentiment of that John Shuttleworth song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=c1nTwfUs7oA">?One Cup of Tea is Never Enough But Two is One Too Many?</a>.</p>
<p>Hugh: Ripping, sharp-tongue lyrics from Jennifer. Precise and spot on. The only song we all play in unison. Works, I think.</p>

<h2>?In Blood?  </h2>
<p>Tom: I think this was the second or third song we recorded for the LP, back in February 2013. I think I did a rough mix and we sat back and collectively went, ?Holy shit, I think this one might be finished?? We barely touched the mix after that day. I really love the sound of Jenny&#8217;s vocals on this one. A few people have thought that those lengthy yells were some kind of processed guitar, which is cool because we actually ran the vocals through a guitar amp to get that springy, narrow sound.</p>
<p>Jenny: I can&#8217;t remember even much discussion about this song. It required no real effort and all of us just kind of fell in on the same strand of thought with it. So much so that I had a feeling there must have been something wrong. But then when we listened back, we were all so happy with it.</p>
<p>Hugh: A different drum machine left a lot more room due to its simple slow tempo. I think Tom and I developed the melody pretty quickly. As soon as the bass line was in there I could hear so many parts &#8211; was itching to record it. Never thought it would have such an ?80s high-school movie feel to it.</p>
<p>Steven: After wiping away the tears, this reminds me of an end credit song from a Ryan Gosling movie.</p>
