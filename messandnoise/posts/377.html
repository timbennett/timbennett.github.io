                <h3>Hooligans, sleep deprivation, fine food and vino &#8211; <strong>JAMIE HUTCHINGS</strong> reports on his first European solo tour in November.
</h3>
<h2>Milan via Seoul</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008328/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Flew Korean Air as it was a sweet deal. Felt a bit like one of those<br/>
characters that gets thrown out of the space station in <em>Total Recall</em>,<br/>
head swelling like a ripe pubescent zit. Don&#8217;t take a window seat.<br/>
The notion is romantic but the couple next to me obviously had<br/>
bladders of steel.</p>
<p>Stayed overnight in Seoul in a schmick hotel room as part of the<br/>
Deal. Similar <em>Total Recall</em> airlessness but I did feel a bit like<br/>
Batman standing in my undies in front of the full-length window<br/>
overlooking the dark, rain-streaked streets below (except my nose was a bit blocked and I had a headache). Took an aisle seat on the second<br/>
leg, could do random yoga poses at will and attend to my ADD bladder<br/>
whenever it prodded me. Got picked up in Milan by Luca, the promoter. He bought me pizza and beer and is a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan. Great guy.</p>
<p>Monday, I went to the Duomo, biggest gothic cathedral in the world;<br/>
funereal organ droning away, intimidating place. Had dinner with Luca, who painstakingly translated word-for-word a glowing review of my album which was really nice but my head was almost in my pasta. Very sleepy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I caught a train to meet a drummer. Luca said he found my music ?very percussive? so he acquired a local guy who I met at the<br/>
train station. ?Mr Jamie?? &#8211; and there he was, Pablo. Pablo couldn&#8217;t<br/>
speak much English, but it kind of made it more fun. You just skip<br/>
the small talk and go for the big stuff and you laugh so much due to the constant incomprehension. He turned out to be a bit of a gem. We rehearse in his mum&#8217;s basement, he&#8217;s worked out the patterns pretty well, has big ears. It&#8217;s a relief indeed to know the tunes will not be accompanied by a man building a shed behind me. His mum chatters to me constantly in Italian, she&#8217;s totally unfussed as to whether I comprehend her or not. I try her homemade white wine and she gives me a bottle of the family made vino as a pressie.</p>
<p>The first gig is at the Paprika Jazz club. As is the pattern over here<br/>
hospitality reigns supreme. Food, drink etc., generally very un-Australian behaviour. I do my best to act as if I&#8217;m being treated in the style to which I am accustomed, but I&#8217;m no thespian &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty awesome. </p>
<p>We don&#8217;t play to many people but Luca is pretty stoked with the performance and is proud of pairing Pablo with me. Doing a two-piece show with just acoustic guitar and drums is kind of exciting, particularly when you&#8217;ve only had one rehearsal and neither of you speak the same language. At some stage, Pablo gets the set confused and things get a bit wild but generally it&#8217;s a success: you&#8217;ve gotta throw out different shapes and find ways of creating certain frequencies. We do an off-the-cuff cover of Neil Young&#8217;s &#8216;On the Beach&#8217; and pack up.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3008329/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The next day, I check out a gigantic cemetery, effigies everywhere. Either these people are after immortality or they&#8217;re loved a lot by  the people they&#8217;ve left behind. I&#8217;ve never seen anything remotely like it. I haven&#8217;t travelled alone for a long time and there&#8217;s this heightened sense to seeing even some of the most mundane things, the realisation you might not see them again. Pablo and I head out to the country in Alessandria. We get totally lost &#8211; winding roads, vineyards, creepers up ancient villas &#8211; and finally arrive. Very comfy place, super friendly people who buy CDs off me before I&#8217;ve played. I must look hungry. I am and they feed us very well. The owner can&#8217;t speak any English but insists on showing me a bottle of Bundaberg Rum just so I know he stocks it. We head home &#8211; Pablo plays shows with me every night and has to work during the day. He drops me off at the hotel at 2am and he&#8217;s still got another 40 minutes to go. Luca is the same: two kids, his booking business and other work. They don&#8217;t stop. Generally, they talk on their mobiles constantly while driving and if they have a GPS system or map they show no interest in using either; it&#8217;s ?mi scusi?? to get directions. Often they just stick their arm out the window and wave a car down. It&#8217;s gold.</p>
<p>The next night we head around half-an-hour out of town to a place<br/>
called Stomp. Kind of swish but larger and more traditionally rock.<br/>
As a result the crowd is a little bigger but also a little more barbaric. It&#8217;s more of a challenge playing in the two-piece format in<br/>
a larger venue but we make it happen. One gent has come along from<br/>
<em><a href="http://www.buscadero.com/">Buscadero</a>* magazine which is sort of Italy&#8217;s answer to mags like *Uncut</em>. He leaves impressed and takes a set list as he wants to write a live review, so that&#8217;s something. Another guy buys a CD for the girl he&#8217;s with in the hope that she will become more enamored of him. By the time I leave it seems to have worked. Luca and I have a brief discussion about the original vocalist in Iron Maiden (who is playing this place soon we see) being superior to Bruce ?The Human Air Raid Siren? Dickenson and then we head off. </p>
<p>Next day, I check out another museum full of paintings of martyrs being beheaded or filled with arrows while maintaining totally mute expressions. Very tough times. Pablo and I head down the coast to Savona. When we get there it&#8217;s night so you can&#8217;t see the sea but the air cuts right through us as soon as we get out of the car. We have a stupidly sized dinner and get into the club which is called Raindogs. It&#8217;s tiny, a very cool little place that looks like it&#8217;s been lifted from a David Lynch film but the show proves a little tough. I&#8217;m falling asleep in my chair before we hit the stage. The thing to add here is that there is no support act for any of these shows so we have to play for at least an hour-and-a-half each night. I generally try to convince them to let us do it in two sets to make it a little less punishing but the owner is scared the small crowd will leave so he requests we play the 20 songs straight. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s just no vibe from the audience this night, it&#8217;s icy and I tell them Pablo and I will be hitting the water tomorrow in our budgie smugglers. No one is roused. Around halfway through the set I&#8217;m feeling a little like Jane Fonda&#8217;s character in <em>They Shoot Horses Don&#8217;t They?</em>, but at the end a big burly guy who speaks no English pumps his fist to his heart and buys a CD. This makes my night. </p>
<p>In the morning, Pablo translates Italian pop songs that are being played over the radio into broken English. Golden sentiments such as, ?Baby you have no soul &#8211; take your clothes off.? Pablo says the two worst things about Italy are the Mafia and the Vatican and we are heading to the heartland of these two worlds: Sicily. Sicily is like a totally different country, really Mediterranean, ancient. After the postwar boom loads of new estates went up so it&#8217;s really incongruous at times seeing ugly huge blocks next to<br/>
centuries-old villas in glorious disrepair. We get picked up by the<br/>
woman who is running the show. There appear to me no lanes on the road and everybody&#8217;s cars are the length of a toothpick. It&#8217;s chaos. </p>
<p>The venue is makeshift, it&#8217;s a night run bi-weekly or so by a music society. We ring a bell out the front of an old building walk up some stairs and walk into what looks like a big flat but it&#8217;s the venue; a room with a basic stage and some chairs. We play to a very eclectic and attentive crowd. Pablo is really coming into his own now and living<br/>
inside the songs more. Halfway through I break a string. It&#8217;s a real<br/>
stress with a dead quiet audience that has difficulty following my<br/>
ramblings and an awkward moment for everyone. I decide to replace it with the wrong gauge while Pablo attempts some native banter. I try a second time. I also look down at my shoe and notice my sole is flapping in the wind. Perfecto.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Doing a two-piece show with just acoustic guitar and drums is kind of exciting, particularly when you&#8217;ve only had one rehearsal and neither of you speak the same language.</p></blockquote>
<p>Afterward we wonder the streets for a while. It&#8217;s pretty much deserted with those ancient buildings looking down at us ominously. We get to some lane and it&#8217;s suddenly wall-to-wall with gothic kids. They&#8217;re fierce-looking like sticky vampires, and I feel the whole place  coagulating in the din and stink. I&#8217;m dead on my feet. Pablo is up for a night on the tiles but I&#8217;ve gotta go. </p>
<p>I try a local specialty the next morning at his prompting. Batter enveloping corn, rice, mozzarella and pork. It&#8217;s food Elvis would love: heavy. In fact, I&#8217;d even go so far as to say the Italians? obsession with meat, cheese and bread can possibly only be equaled with Austereo&#8217;s unending romance with Cold Chisel. It&#8217;s a love affair that&#8217;s exhausting me a little. We spend most of the next day waiting for a plane that never seems to want to arrive before doing our final show together in Milan. Luca has got as many troops together as he can, and we again pull off a really together show.</p>
<p>I speak to a local after the gig who is keen on Died Pretty, The New Christs, The Church &#8211; the whole &#8217;80s underground Australian scene &#8211;<br/>
and wonders what&#8217;s happened since then. Tells me he first saw Died Pretty over here playing to 1000 people. Golden days. It&#8217;s a relief after being bailed up a couple of times with enquiries about Tommy Emmanuel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the last show and I feel pretty indebted to Luca, Pablo and, of course, my American saviour Amanda who has organised all of this. I have a couple of days off so I decide to see Venice before it ends<br/>
up underwater. I walk out of my tiny hostel a couple of times and<br/>
somehow am at the front again. It&#8217;s kind of like someone has dredged<br/>
this city out of the murky subconsciousness of some deranged genius.<br/>
An amazing labyrinth. I&#8217;ve gotta catch a 6am flight and ask<br/>
the desk clerk for a wake up call at 3.50am. I get one at 3.15 am. I<br/>
guess 15 and 50 sound really similar. </p>
<h2>Paris via London</h2>

I am flying via London to get the cheapest deal to Paris. I get to London and there&#8217;s a bomb scare at Heathrow. The bus drops me in an out of the way point as the terminal is closed. Some dodgy directions crossed with unwise panicked decision-making somehow sees me on a train to Paddington while my flight heads to Paris. I hang around to catch a later one. I have no idea where I&#8217;m gonna to sleep tonight. </p>
<p>I get a text message from Ludo, who is putting a couple of shows on for me up in Brittany, saying there&#8217;s a band leaving for Brittany after their gig tonight if I want a lift. I&#8217;ve been up since a zombie hour, the band won&#8217;t leave until midnight and it&#8217;s a 500-kilometre drive. Why not? I queue for a train ticket and in front of me is Peter Fenton of Crow infamy&#8217;s son Jasper. The world grows tinier. The Paris subway is full of shickered football hooligans. They&#8217;re like an endless dunderhead army and I have to crawl against them with all my junk.<br/>
Later, the Algerians beat Egypt and it&#8217;s even more out of control, bums hanging out of cars etc., and the trains are crammed. </p>
<p>I get to this bar called Le Feline, where the guys I&#8217;m meeting are playing. ?They? turn out to be a one-man band called Shake it Like a Caveman aka Blake from Tennessee. He plays dirty sub-delta blues in a space suit while manning a kick drum, hi-hat and electric geetar. This place is mental, a couple of girls barely out of their teens dance and half molest Blake throughout the show. Though, as I find out later, this is regular fare. The surly bartenders seem as intoxicated as the patrons. I owe a hefty sleep debt, I really can&#8217;t keep up here. </p>
<p>Eventually, Blake, Julien (his mixer/driver) and I get out of there and I cuddle up to a seatbelt for the 500km haul arriving at Ludo&#8217;s house at around 5am. I resemble a single-celled organism. I fall into a very deep sleep and dream that my new hosts are attacking me. This proves most un-prophetic. Binic is a quaint seaside town a million miles from Paris. Ludo runs a little bar/cafe here and I play that night there. He says yes to everything, sleeps rarely and has a heart of gold. It&#8217;s Beaujolais nouveau day, where the new vintages are bottled and everybody is on it. Ludo cracks a bottle of St-Emilion Bordeaux ?03 that tastes like it was sourced from a single vineyard somewhere in heaven. </p>

Playing the show in Ludo&#8217;s bar is a little like performing in a lounge room, or Madam Fling Flongs in Newtown, or somewhere. I don&#8217;t get to play these kind of rooms often. There&#8217;s something that happens between the audience and performer that can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) happen in a proper club, and I have a bit of a record CD-selling night.</p>
<p>The next day we head a bit further north where I play at a restaurant/ bar overlooking the sea. It&#8217;s chilly and the streets are totally deserted. I get fed very well here. French food is very sophisticated and tasty though a good vet would be able to get many of their steaks back on the road. They sure like them super rare. A woman gives us 20 Euros and requests I play a song at their table. I feel like a Mexican troubadour and don&#8217;t know how to refuse in French, but they buy three<br/>
albums so I figure it&#8217;s no time to pull out the indie diva card. Ludo and friends play pretty hard and I&#8217;m a party soft kind of guy so I crawl away eventually from the after show rabble and snooze while they revel into the very wee hours.</p>
<h2>London via Paris</h2>
<p>I head south to Paris to catch my connecting train to London and stay with a girl called Sonia who is Paris&#8217; number one (and perhaps only) Bluebottle Kiss fan. I&#8217;m very sleep deprived but she gives me a<br/>
whirlwind tour of the city of lights. It&#8217;s raining, making the whole city pretty and blurry. My head is spinning but she&#8217;s keen on a couple of tunes so I sheepishly clunk through a couple of substandard versions before keeling over into the land of nod. I get to London and my phone<br/>
dies. I have no way of calling my hosts to work out where they live or<br/>
even getting their number as being the genius I am I have not written<br/>
it down anywhere. It&#8217;s in the dead phone. I wander the streets of<br/>
London until I access the number online, spend a bunch of change<br/>
dialling the number incorrectly and finally hit paydirt and make it to<br/>
the flat I&#8217;m staying at. </p>
<p>There are so many human beings in London. The tube is sardine can-like and when you add a guitar a backpack and a total lack of directional sense it gets ugly. But funny. The first show I have is at the windmill in Brixton. It&#8217;s kind of in the middle of a residential nowhere and I walk through what seems like a blizzard for a small eternity before getting there. It&#8217;s a rough-as-guts kind of layout, but Tim the owner is a nice guy and it&#8217;s the third time I&#8217;ve played there. It&#8217;s pretty quiet, but I sell the last of my CDs and an old fan/friend from Adelaide called Jared and his girlfriend shout me a cab which is super sweet. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3008332/440x329-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I spend a day recovering in a strange suit-shaped sleeping bag that my host Rob has laid out for me. It&#8217;s Monday night and I&#8217;m playing at a place called The Slaughtered Lamb. I get squashed again in the tube and wander lost for around half-an-hour before a kind librarian points me in the right direction. Despite the death metal overtones of the name, it&#8217;s a very sweet room in the basement lined with couches and, as usual in London, a nice loyal and mostly ex-pat turnout. My battery runs out and I break a string, but each time the support act magically saves the day with a fine surplus of replacements and technical solutions. I even manage a cover of &#8216;Head Full of Steam&#8217; by the Go-Bees to make the homesick Aussies a bit more homesick. I get a lift from a lovely acquaintance called Tom. We get very lost, the London directory looks like a map of veins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my last show in London the next night. I&#8217;ve been offered a last<br/>
minute show the week before at the UCLU (University College London Students&#8217; Union). Playing at universities is weird &#8211; even more so when it&#8217;s in another country. This night is called ?Folkulture? and it&#8217;s smattered with earnest and not-so earnest spoken word performances. The support act is an impressive guy called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jackcheshire">Jack Cheshire</a> who does a nice contemporary take on &#8217;70s style, English folk with Nick Drake kind of fingerpicking. He&#8217;s even a little like our own Ned Collette. By this stage, I feel pretty much in the zone and do what I&#8217;m sure is a totally mistake free set. There&#8217;s a period film playing behind which concerns a young maiden and a count who has gone AWOL. It&#8217;s distracting but a nice touch.</p>
<p>I visit the Royal Academy of Arts the next day and watch an installation by Anish Kapoor. One of the pieces is a cannon that fires red wax against the lovely academy walls. It gives everyone a bit of a fright. I&#8217;m trying to squeeze myself back on the tube again to get to the airport. I am rammed out the way by three people in a row thus further damaging my take on general humanity here. The last guy is half man, half elephant. Survival of the fattest, or fastest &#8230; it&#8217;s time to go home.</p>
