<h2>Week Three</h2>
<p><strong>Hazel:</strong> During the day we walked around San Francisco for a few delicious hours. We split up and went separate directions for the first time. I got asked out by another middle-aged man (third time so far on this tour). It&#8217;s worrying, perhaps the stress has really aged me! We met up again at Amoeba records where I bought some cheap Chaka Khan, Dinosaur L, and Mary Jane Girls, which I was happy about and Owen threw a peanut butter and ginger lolly at me from upstairs, it was wonderful.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3015187/350x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
That night we played to a packed-out crowd in a long and narrow bar in Oakland, CA, that reminded me a bit of Joe&#8217;s Shoe Store or Horse Bazaar in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The following night in Santa Cruz, we played to chatty college kids, who were not hugely interested in Otouto. They put balloons on the stage which drove me a little insane. Luckily the people at the venue were really friendly and gave us free meals of savoury crepes and freshly baked wholemeal honey bread.</p>
<p>On the way to LA, we drove with mountains on one side and water on the other. Caravans lined the shore, head to toe like carriages of a train. I wrote this list of all the crops and vegies we&#8217;d seen since we left Chicago (some we guessed at): pumpkins, lettuce, artichokes, corn, sunflowers (and seeds) and olives.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3015188/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In LA we played at a venue called The Smell where I filmed Martha doing a wee in the amazingly graffiti covered toilets (wait for the doco). It was just a joke, and I only filmed her face, but we forgot to lock the door, and someone walked in and saw us. I exacerbated the situation by walking backwards, still recording, thinking that I was shutting the door with my back, when I was in fact opening it wider and revealing our silliness to the entire queue. It was hilariously embarrassing since we were about to go on stage.</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong></p>
<p>Today we left Santa Cruz and drove to San Luis Obispo. We are at a nice part of the tour where the drives are only about four hours long, so I&#8217;ve been enjoying some slower mornings. On the drive, we debated over what animals we could see in the hills, and I realised that we have gradually become used to the American landscape.</p>
<p>We were looking out at the beautifully grand boulders, dappled desert like hills speckled with rock and dry fauna and seeing other pictures &#8211; as if what they were wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Last night, as we were eating crepes before a show, we realised we&#8217;d become much like a weird family: Hazel is mum, Kish is the baby, I&#8217;m the hippie inappropriate aunty and Owen is the lonely lovable uncle. It has always made me a bit nauseous when bands have said they&#8217;re like a family, so this realisation came as a bit of a surprise. A nice one nonetheless.</p>
<p>Accepting this familial relationship we all share, everybody has now opened up the bag on what is pissing them off:</p>
<p>? Owen is going mad over how much female underwear is hanging around: sports bras hanging off car doors (drying), undies drying on the car seats, undies on the sink at the motel, bras falling out of suitcases. I didn&#8217;t realise how much there was until he listed them all for me.<br/>
? Kish feels defeated when we tell him he&#8217;s told us his stories a million times.<br/>
? Hazel and I are going a little crazy about how often Kish plays Deerhoof when he drives. (A band we both love, but a couple of times a day gets to be too much.)<br/>
? Kish answers back with how much we play the same things too.<br/>
? Kish, Hazel and I have constantly been walking around in bare feet which apparently makes Owen want to spew &#8211; Just this very moment Owen has started a ?bare feet in bathrooms? debate with some guy and it is RAUCUS in here!</p>
<p>So, yes, I guess we are sort of like a babbling, arguing family. With a lot of love.</p>
<p>In LA we played at The Smell, which is quite a famous all-ages, venue, covered in graffiti and old posters with a candy bar and a good zine collection. It&#8217;s a long skinny brick walled building, with the craziest looking paint-splattered bathrooms I&#8217;ve ever seen, and pretty intimidating hipster regulars. (I should have put in more effort into my appearance, as the whole audience looked like they were out of a <em>NYLON</em> issue.)</p>
<p>The show went well although I did have a cold which resulted in me scoffing my face with Manuka honey between each song, and Hazel kindly opened the door to the line while I was on the toilet.</p>
<p>The worst thing about LA that I will regret &#8211; hopefully not for the rest of my life &#8211; is that I hurt my back! It was a long night, and desperate to get some sleep I decided to attempt to carry my massive Roland amp. So since that fateful night I haven&#8217;t been able to sit for more than a couple of minutes, or bend over, or carry anything, or run, or doing anything accept lie on my back. Sucks I know, I think I&#8217;m jinxed.</p>
<p><strong>Kishore:</strong> The doctor at the Royal Melbourne Hospital had told me not to use my left arm for at least six weeks. I had fallen off my skateboard and broken my left elbow. Our tour was to start in two weeks.</p>
<p>For a while I got by with one hand. From Chicago to Seattle, then up to Canada and back down to Portland. But enough was enough. I was sick and tired of one-handed drumbeats. I had waited five weeks and that was long enough.</p>
<p>Our second Portland show was in an old Hare Krishna restaurant, which had been converted into a sharehouse. For the first few songs my left arm felt tingly and feathery but by the end it felt pretty much back to normal.</p>
<p>It had become customary for Owen to throw tambourines into the audience during the Casiotone set. However, something different happened this time. One of the tambourines accidentally hit a light on the ceiling and showered the front row of the audience in glass, cutting a man&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3015189/440x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In San Francisco, we met up with my Australian friends Sarah and Jack for breakfast. Apparently the pancakes were amazing, but I needed my daily fix of Mexican food so I had a tofu burrito with avocado. Afterwards, I wandered around the Mission. Police were questioning two men, one of whom was bleeding from the face.</p>
<p>Later we drove across the bridge to Oakland and played a gig in a packed little bar with no monitors and a very small PA. After the show I met a guy called Kevin and his friend Yohta. We talked about Carson McCullers for a while. They said they would probably drive down to Santa Cruz to catch our show the following night at the Crepe Place.</p>
<p>The scenery the next day was pretty. Owen, Hazel, Martha and I swapped stories about problematic relationships from the past, unrequited love and awkward dates.</p>
<p>Two important things happened at the Crepe Place. The first thing was regrettable. It happened because the waitress informed us we could order what we wanted, on the house, provided that each person&#8217;s order fit onto one plate. I got a little excited, experimental and greedy with my order.</p>
<p>Up until that moment the great catalogue of mouth-watering food I had managed to consume since my arrival in America was unblemished. I can&#8217;t remember exactly what I ordered on that inauspicious night, but I can tell you that, collectively, the ingredients on my crepe amounted to something that was indistinguishable and insipid. The only thing I could distinguish was warm avocado.</p>
<p>The other thing that happened was a good thing and it happened because Kevin and his friend Yohta came to the show. It was nice to see them again. I told Kevin that I&#8217;d finished <em>Reflections of a Golden Eye</em>, the Carson McCullers book I&#8217;d been reading. Yohta told me about his father&#8217;s gardening business in Japan and Kevin asked me if I&#8217;d read any Sherwood Anderson books. I said I hadn&#8217;t. Kevin told me he had one of Anderson&#8217;s books in his car. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read it several times and I don&#8217;t really have a use for it anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were monitors at the Crepe Place and the PA was better than the night before. After the show Kevin had fetched the book from his car and was waiting to give it to me. That was the good thing. Inside the cover he wrote: &#8220;Kishore. Good luck. Kevin.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Week Four</h2>
<p><strong>Hazel:</strong> In Austin, Texas, we came the closest we had to guns. Martha and I were out walking in the morning when we heard constant sirens. We found out when we got back to the house that it was a student in the nearby college, who had gone into the library and open-fired. Luckily he didn&#8217;t hit anyone, but sadly shot himself. This was a bit of a wake up call that we were in Texas and it was likely that lots of people had guns.</p>
<p>In Houston the next day, we asked our new friend <a href="http://superunison.com">Ryan Chavez</a> about guns. He told us that lots of his friends have guns, and his parents do, and if he ever owns property, he&#8217;d probably consider getting one. We told him how strange this was to us having never even seen a gun, apart from on the hip of a police officer. Martha said if she ever bought a gun, she&#8217;d be so scared of accidentally shooting herself that she&#8217;d never be able to touch it. And if she ever needed to use it, she&#8217;d probably end up throwing it at the opposition.</p>
<p>After our show in Denton was the first time I really hit a wall and felt utterly exhausted. It was about the third night since Martha had hurt her back, and I&#8217;d been doing a lot of lifting, loading, setting up and packing up gear, being Martha and Kishore&#8217;s muscles for them. I decided to have a Coke, which I never do, because I felt like if I stopped I&#8217;d have to sit down and ball my eyes out. I was that tired.</p>

In Memphis, the crowd were like zombies. They were so mellow, it was freaky. Standing there swaying a little bit while we played and then clapping nearly in slow motion after each song. It was totally bizarre, but still fun.</p>
<p>Driving around the next morning, we saw very few people and lots of beautiful old buildings. Owen dropped us off at the Stax museum at about 11.30am and picked us up two hours later. I usually don&#8217;t get excited about tourist attractions, but this was really special. Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t the original building &#8211; they tore that down and built a modern one &#8211; but the information was fascinating. I did a lot of reading, particularly about the history of soul, gospel and country music and about the founders of the label Estelle Axton and her brother Jim Stewart. I took photos of the tape machines for my producer friend, and of the label contracts and agreements for my geeky self.</p>
<p>A few interesting things I learned:<br/>
? The classic song ?Try a Little Tenderness? was written in 1933.<br/>
? Australians find gross things and toilet humour way funnier than Americans.<br/>
&#8211; Americans say ?noo-gut? for nougat.</p>

<p><strong>Martha:</strong>  Last night we played three shows. Well to be fair, three sets at two different venues. Our friend Ryan who we met at our gig in Denver booked us as Coco Rosie&#8217;s main support in Houston Texas. It was too good to pass up and we opted for running between two venues and two soundchecks.</p>
<p>We played at Fitzgerald&#8217;s for the CR support, which is a really nice ranch-like building with a risen theatre&#8217;esque stage. It was a really fun show, with great sound and ridiculously friendly staff.</p>
<p>After our set we ran from the stage to the car and from the car to another stage and played Otouto&#8217;s set, then Casiotone&#8217;s. It was a crazy night, but so much fun all the same. A really cute kid with an amazing afro danced up the front of our set, and even asked me to sign his Casio SK?5.</p>
<p>The next day Ryan took us to see the Rothko Chapel, and an art gallery near by. The chapel was like nothing I&#8217;d ever seen before. It was an octagonal room, with huge &#8211; and at first glance quite plain &#8211; paintings on each wall. But the more I looked at them the more I saw what the flyer described as: ?A stance against the finite barriers, driven into the psyche of society.?</p>
<p>In the gallery I found myself drawn mainly to the natural colours, the beiges and creams on white backgrounds, the textured canvas? detailed subtly with layers and layers of paint, with drips, cracks and clumps of the same colour. It was interesting to observe the progress that appeared between time and detail &#8211; the pieces became simpler and smaller and more detached as they neared the present. The more time progressed, it seemed the greater the struggle became to create something unique and beautiful.</p>

We all have our favourites, I guess &#8211; charcoal on off-white will always sell, in the same way that good country music will never die. There appears to be an ancient recipe for what will work, in music and any other form of art.</p>
<p>I came out pretty confused, and with a sore back. We sat on the grass waiting for Owen to come and pick us up. This recipe that appeared on the walls of each room of the gallery confused me, and I can&#8217;t stop from thinking whether I&#8217;m following it or not &#8211; or whether I want to.</p>
<p>Silly, 21-year-old questioning, I know, but I think this week has affected me the most in terms of music-making and how I want to make it. No conclusions yet. Just a lot of questioning to entertain me on the long drives ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Kishore:</strong> On our way down to Los Angeles, I lay in the back of the van reading the Sherwood Anderson book that Kevin had kindly given me. It was called <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em>. We arrived in Los Angeles and drank some expensive orange lattes. But there was one thing I really wanted to do. As a teenager I worshiped the prog-rock band Tool and I had heard that Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan frequented a certain cafe in Los Angeles called Millie&#8217;s. Apparently, you could even get a ?Maynard Special? there.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Millie&#8217;s it was closed so we drove somewhere else and ate some salad. Later that night, we played at The Smell, which was very narrow and long. Because of the shape of the room, it sounded like there was reverb on everything. Foot Foot, who opened the night, played on the floor near the entrance. The vocals were whiny and captivating. The Former Ghosts set was intense and highly emotional. Watching Freddie perform was very enjoyable. Unfortunately someone threw up on Former Ghosts? merch stand and a whole lot of Owen&#8217;s electronics broke.</p>
<p>The next morning Owen and I went to Millie&#8217;s, where we met up with his friend Chris Cohen. Chris used to play in Deerhoof and the Curtains, but Owen and Chris didn&#8217;t talk about the past much. Owen asked Chris if he was still enjoying living in LA and Chris said he&#8217;d gotten to a certain point in his life where it didn&#8217;t really matter where he lived anymore, just as long as he was doing what he wanted to do. He said he was thinking about returning to school to study planets. I mainly just listened. When Chris asked me why I wanted to come to Millie&#8217;s so much, I told him, but I didn&#8217;t tell him about my obsession with Deerhoof.</p>
<p>The Maynard Special turned out to be scrambled eggs, spinach and pine nuts, which didn&#8217;t particularly appeal to me that morning. I ordered a Devil&#8217;s Mess with a biscuit (in case you don&#8217;t know, in America, a biscuit is a bready thing that you have instead of toast. It&#8217;s basically just a scone.) After breakfast we went and picked up Hazel and Martha and set off towards Arizona.</p>

<p>In Sherwood&#8217;s book, an old man in a state of half-sleep has a vision. All the people he has ever known appear before his eyes as grotesques. The old man writes a book about the grotesques in which he states that originally, in an undeveloped world, there were no truths. There were only thoughts. Truths are manmade. After a while, when people came along and claimed the truths, it was their ownership of the truths that made the people ugly; that turned them into grotesques. The old man wrote hundreds of pages about this idea of his but his book was never published. The fact that it remained unpublished meant that his idea never succeeded in turning the old man into a grotesque himself.</p>
<p>In Houston, Texas, our friend Ryan took us to the Rothko Chapel. After our visit we strolled through the park and before Hazel and I had a chance to awaken from our state of reverie, Martha said, ?Shotgun talking about that in our tour diary!? However, she&#8217;s kindly given me permission to write a couple of sentences about it. The chapel is basically an empty room with dark coloured canvases on the walls and chairs in the middle. At the time it simply felt like a very peaceful place, but when I started writing this, I realised that because the Rothko Chapel is nondenominational, it escapes grotesqueness.</p>
<p>As I write this, I recall another part of my visit to America thus far, namely, my visit to Gilgal Gardens in Salt Lake City, Utah. The garden is a visionary art garden and is open to the public. The stone sculptures are pretty unusual. They draw on religious symbolism and mythology and something about the garden is very eccentric. In one section of the garden stone, body parts are scattered across the ground and in another section two stone hands reach down from the roof of a small cave. A businessman named Thomas Child created the garden in his spare time out of a strong dedication to Mormonism. Thinking about it now, after having read Anderson&#8217;s story about the old man, it struck me as a perfect example of someone wholeheartedly dedicating his life to one truth. Even though the garden was built with the intention of providing a type of sanctuary, there was definitely something ugly about it.</p>
<p>From Houston, we weaved our way north. At some point Hazel and I contracted scabies. When we drove through Indianapolis, Indiana, we were startled to see, stretching for miles and miles on each side of the road, children and old people holding signs up at the passing cars: ?Abortion Kills Children? and ?Jesus Will Save You.? I wondered if Jesus could save us from scabies. Eventually we made it to Chicago, where we stayed in fancy hotel and watched TV.</p>
