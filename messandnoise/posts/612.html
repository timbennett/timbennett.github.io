                <h3>We look back on the final days of Melbourne punk rock institution The Arthouse, which closed its doors after 20 years on Sunday (May 1). Mugshots by <strong>ANNA BROWN<em>*, ?Last Drinks? photo by *</em>GREG BRICKNELL</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020448/440x505-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Melbourne punk rock institution The Arthouse shut its doors on Sunday, but not before a $150 beer was sculled. After the entire pub was drunk dry, the final stubbie was purchased by booker Dave Collins at an on-stage auction. ?He immediately ripped the scab off it and sculled it for the chanting crowd,? assistant booker Amanda Roff told <em>M+N</em> this week.</p>
<p>The ceremonial beer chug unofficially brought to an end 20 years of Melbourne rock&#8217;n?roll history. In 1991, then 17-year-old Melanie Bodiam (nee Kelly) moved into the Arthouse Hotel on the corner of Elizabeth and Queensberry Streets, North Melbourne, with the idea of starting a punk music venue. She enthusiastically cleaned ashtrays until pouring her first beer &#8211; at midnight on her 18th birthday. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3020449/400x536-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Up until Sunday, Bodiam and husband Matt, along with their dog Jack, still lived in and managed The Arthouse. Early last year, they decided not to renew their lease. The relationship with the building&#8217;s landlord had reportedly soured; a situation compounded when the pub was hit by the same liquor licensing regulations that contributed to the <a href="/articles/3847100">demise</a> of the Bruce Milne-era Tote.</p>
<p>?I think we have had a good go and it&#8217;s been an incredible 19 years,? a philosophical Bodiam told <em>M+N</em> last year. ?I think what sets The Arthouse apart and why it has survived this far under the one licensee, is that it&#8217;s a family business with each member bringing different skills &#8211; Not to mention the adopted family in staff that have poured their energies into the place for as long as 10, 15 and 18 years; that&#8217;s pretty much unheard of in hospitality. And, of course, the bands and punters that have made it their own and created a real sense of community locally, nationally and internationally.?</p>
<p>Those sentiments were echoed in a <a href="/articles/4244632">tribute piece</a> by The Nation Blue&#8217;s Tom Lyngcoln, who said The Arthouse provided a ?home away from home? after his band shifted from Tassie. ?The Arthouse felt more like a family home than a pub,? wrote Lyngcoln, who played his first show at The Arthouse supporting Blueline Medic in 2001. ?And as a new citizen to the big country I longed for the <em>Cheers</em> scenario and found it there.?</p>
<p>That sense of community characterised The Arthouse&#8217;s final fortnight of gigs, which saw sold-out performances by bands that have ?made The Arthouse their home? including Mid Youth Crisis (in their last ever show), Conation, Away From Now, Days Worth Fighting, No Grace, The Nation Blue, Mindsnare, Extortion and a reformed Horsell Common and Antiskeptic. ?We were overwhelmed with the amount of support and all the trouble people went to,? Roff says. ?A number of people took two weeks off from their lives and came from interstate and even from Germany to attend every show.?</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3020450/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Others showed their love for the Arty in unusual and creative ways. They made handmade shirts, patches and posters (Melbourne punk act Mindsnare made limited-edition ?Last Drinks? shirts, hoodies and gave away free posters commemorating the pub), while Roff says a ?surprising number? of people immortalised The Arthouse on their skin.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020452/402x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
?People got Arthouse tattoos of varying designs,? she says. ?A couple of guys who couldn&#8217;t get tickets for the last show came down with a BBQ and cooked over three kilos of snags and snacks for all of the punters, and gave them away as a way of saying thanks to The Arty.?</p>
<p>The Arthouse&#8217;s final days were captured by Anna Brown, a photographer from Wollongong, who came to every show and snapped mugshots of punters, bands and staff members. Brown says she wanted to pay tribute to the unsung heroes of the pub. She snapped 1400 portraits over nine days, and hopes to one day publish the collection as a book.</p>
<p>?To me there are thick lines of punk-rock ancestry that flow through the place,? she told <em>M+N</em> this week. ?All of my Australian music heroes are linked in some way to the place and some of the best gigs I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of attending were at The Arthouse. Although I knew all of this going in to the project, I was still absolutely blown away by the spirit of the Kelly and Bodiam families, their friends and employees who are all so passionately involved in making The Arthouse what it was. It was easy to see how it had become such a special and unique venue.?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are thick lines of punk-rock ancestry that flow through the place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Arthouse&#8217;s final weekend saw an emotional Saturday night performance by H-Block 101, who reformed for the show, as well as The Hawaiian Islands, Fear Like Us and The Critics from WA. ?The were no bands [on Sunday],? says Roff, ?but that didn&#8217;t stop the crowd surfing for The Arthouse&#8217;s resident party DJ, DJ Trapdoor, who played hits and memories from many Arthouse parties.? Even Lionel Ritchie got a spin. ?The crowd held people upside down in the air so they could literally dance on the ceiling.?</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of The Arthouse&#8217;s closure, booker Dave Collins jokes he&#8217;s going to have a ?mind holiday?, while Roff is busy with her band The Ukeladies. As for the fate of the building, Roff says it&#8217;s unclear. ?We have no idea &#8211; it&#8217;s a mystery,? she explains. The future for the Bodiam/Kelly family is just as unsure. While Melanie and Matt Bodiam are reportedly keen to start another venue, no concrete plans are afoot. For now at least, they&#8217;re still reeling from the closure of the institution and community they helped build.</p>
<p>?The last month felt like one giant hug,? says Bodiam, ?and I got to see all my favourite bands.?</p>
