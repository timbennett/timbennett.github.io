                <h3>He may share his name with You Am I&#8217;s idiosyncratic frontman, but that doesn&#8217;t mean Tim Rogers (aka Jack Ladder) wants to tackle Missy Higgins or do guitar windmills, he tells <strong>JOSH JENNINGS</strong>.

It&#8217;s hard to decide what&#8217;s more unlikely. Wearing women&#8217;s clothes and a wig or deciding to belt out ?Diamonds Are a Girl&#8217;s Best Friend?. But 25-year-old Sydney troubadour Jack Ladder did both: a cappella and in front of his entire primary school no less. Relaying that anecdote isn&#8217;t the only reason why he presents as every bit the curiosity on the phone. He&#8217;s also prone to pausing mid-sentence for so long it makes you start to wonder whether it&#8217;s worth running the risk of interrupting to at least determine he hasn&#8217;t hung up, become disconnected or worse. Then we he does resume, his voice is so soft it sounds like he&#8217;s basically not there anyway. Other times, he just sounds like he&#8217;s incredibly bored.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to fathom then, how he&#8217;s the man behind <em>Love Is Gone*, given all its jazzy and bluesy bombast and its curious rollicking neon-lit baritone vocalising. Ladder says he attributes the lack of endeavour to &#8220;get everything perfect&#8221; to getting that album &#8211; the follow-up to the much more timid and morose *Not Worth Waiting For</em> &#8211; to breathe like it does.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only really rehearsed the rhythm section and all the pianos and guitars and stuff were kind of improvised in the studio, and it was never about trying to create a real opus or anything,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We were just trying to create an energy and tap into something you can&#8217;t necessarily hear &#8230; I&#8217;d been working previously in the country on a record with lots of stuff going on. There was too much stuff, like too many oboes and a wind ensemble playing. It was cluttered and dull and it didn&#8217;t mean anything any more. You can really get lost in the process of recording and I just wanted to make something that was a bit simple and good, you know &#8211; like, good soup.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you might suspect from the title, <em>Love Is Gone</em>&#8216;s overarching theme centres on male/female relationships in one incarnation or another.  But endowing the record with a grand theme wasn&#8217;t a priority, Ladder says. &#8220;I just wanted to write simple songs, like Smokey Robinson and those kinds of Motown songwriters that wrote simply and directly from the heart without thinking any more than that.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>?You can really get lost in the process of recording and I just wanted to make something that was a bit simple and good, you know &#8211; like, good soup.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Simple is the word he uses to describe how Spunk Records picked the album up too. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ever give the record to anybody else. I just gave it to Aaron [Curnow] and he put it out &#8211; no more complex than that. I like Spunk Records; I realised that all the records I was buying at a certain point in time were coming out through Spunk. And I was like, I wanted to be associated with the people that Spunk was putting out, and I guess that&#8217;s what labels are about &#8211; being on the team. Artists like Will Oldham and Bill Callahan are some of my favourite songwriters, and just about everything Aaron has put out I find listenable in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Will Oldham, Ladder performs under a pseudonym. His real name is Tim Rogers. But has this coincidence had any bearing on his experience as a musician? Not really, he explains. But when You Am I were at the height of their powers and Ladder was a teenager trying to win competitions they were tied to, entering said competitions under his real name did cause a few headaches. &#8220;I&#8217;d call up Waterfront Records for these phone competitions &#8211; trying to win a CD or poster or something &#8211; and they&#8217;d be like, &#8216;What&#8217;s your name?&#8217; And I&#8217;d be like, &#8216;Tim Rogers.&#8217;  And they&#8217;d be like, &#8216;Get fucked.'&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004897/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It means that Ladder gets the odd unexpected phone call too. &#8220;I know Andy [Kent] from You Am I and he put me in his phone as Tim Rogers as well, so sometimes I get calls from him. But that&#8217;s probably as much problem as it&#8217;s been. I don&#8217;t have any sort of identity crisis where I want to tackle Missy Higgins or do windmill guitar stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ladder, one of a slew of musicians to adopt a stage name, says it does serve a purpose other than alleviating confusion in the music industry. &#8220;It creates an element of show or character,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s not Jack Brown or Jack Taylor. It does have an element of theatre. I can go on stage and it is different; I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s different but it is different. But there is a perception that it&#8217;s different and that allows it to be. I haven&#8217;t really done enough touring or shows to really explore what the full nature of the character is but I think that it does grow with time and it&#8217;s changed a lot from where it started and I guess it will just continue to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ladder will have an opportunity to get further in touch with his alter-ego when he kicks off a 12-date national tour starting in Sydney this week. With a full backing band in tow, he says he&#8217;s excited by the prospect of changing the songs around. Some things, however, likely won&#8217;t change any time soon, he adds. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be more records and more making music,? he says. ?I&#8217;m not going to shift to acting or have a career change or anything.?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Ladder being sardonic. In a testament to his astuteness as a performer, however, you&#8217;d barely know.</p>
