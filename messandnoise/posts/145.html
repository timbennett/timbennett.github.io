                <h3>Major Major&#8217;s Adrian Slattery tells <strong>JOSH JENNINGS</strong> he&#8217;s prone to an evil moment or two.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3001742/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="293"/><br/>
It&#8217;s the bane of a good whack of indie bands? existences: money buys time in the recording studio, but money and indie don&#8217;t gel particularly well. Melbourne indie popsters Major Major are a case in point. When they recorded their second EP <em>Great Leagues</em> in June, they had two days to rear something they were happy to stand behind.</p>
<p>?I know we only had four songs to record,? says Major Major&#8217;s singer/guitarist Adrian Slattery, ?but we needed quite a few takes to get one or two of them, and when you know you only have that limited amount of time, the longer it takes you the more stressed you get. Even though you try to put it out of your mind, it can start to affect the performance I think.?</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s where Axl Rose was coming from with the infamously delayed <em>Chinese Democracy</em>? Anyway, Major Major hasn&#8217;t let a nagging deadline dampen the quality of their offering nevertheless. The unabashed nod to the 1990s slacker bent of bands such as Pavement that defined their early sound is still fairly prominent in the music on the EP. But the quartet has opened the door a little to some new influences too.</p>
<p>This is most evident in first single, ?The Beast?, which goes into dramatic mode at the top of the song &#8211; by way of a glass-shattering distortion riff &#8211; and ceases to relent until the wall-sized chorus of voices barrels through at the end.</p>
<p>And who is this ?beast? that Slattery sings about in the song?</p>
<p>?The song just felt big,? he says. ?When we were playing it in the room it just felt like something was coming, and the lyrics summed that up. It&#8217;s just this presence and the song is about this sense that something big is coming for you.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?I like opposing a light sort of pop sound with a bit of a sinister approach.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The songs on <em>Great Leagues* lapse in and out of moments of warm acoustic folk-pop and distortion-drunk indie-rock. Slattery says one of the most satisfying parts of recording *Great Leagues</em> was that the band managed to flesh out the arrangements a little more this time around &#8211; even if they did only have a couple of days to do so.</p>
<p>?I know it&#8217;s not grandiose or anything, but we added a few extra parts with some trumpets and piano, and that&#8217;s what I like the most about this one: It&#8217;s a bit more textured than the last one.?</p>
<p>Ground Components bassist Indra Adams produced the EP, which was recorded at Sound Park Studios in Fitzroy, and Slattery says he was already checking in on rehearsals before the recording sessions began.</p>
<p>?He really pushed out people&#8217;s performances so they were spot on. He helped out with arranging the songs and really tightening them up too. It was good to have someone who would really articulate the direction of the songs. We&#8217;d all have our ideas and shout them about, but he kind of harnessed that and put some focus in it.?</p>
<p>The band&#8217;s bright sound belies the tone of Slattery&#8217;s lyrical content. He says he doesn&#8217;t consciously set out to sing about dark subject matter (death is a recurring theme), but says he can see some benefits in his songwriting method.</p>
<p>?I guess I like opposing a light sort of pop sound with a bit of a sinister approach,? he says. ?I get a good vibe out of it when I&#8217;m doing it. I like telling those sorts of stories, but I don&#8217;t like brooding or a brooding sound, so I guess that&#8217;s the kind of medium ground I reach when I&#8217;m doing that.?</p>
<p><em>Great Leagues</em> will be available on iTunes this month.  It&#8217;s on the back of a little bit of Triple J airplay for the band, but not enough to really have an impact on the band&#8217;s profile, Slattery says.</p>
<p>?It&#8217;s nice to have that endorsement by the radio station, and it does have a major impact if you get a song on high rotation and you have this national audience that starts hearing it, but unless you get that rotation I don&#8217;t think it really changes people&#8217;s awareness of the band.?</p>
<p>The band hopes to register wider interest with a tri-state tour that began in Melbourne on November 8. The shows will precede a string of other Melbourne dates leading up to the new year.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;ve only done a few small tours and this is another small tour &#8211; four dates,? says Slattery. ?But I love getting out and playing some stuff to different audiences. Even the shows that haven&#8217;t been quite that good, the experience is still really good. Brisbane is probably my second favourite place to play after Melbourne. We&#8217;ve got a lot of friends up there now and people that come to see us, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to that. Sydney&#8217;s a little bit more unknown, but I guess you have to start somewhere.?</p>
