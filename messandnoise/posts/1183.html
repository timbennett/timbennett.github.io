                <h3>After months of speculation, Royal Headache singer Shogun (pictured below centre) sets the record straight on the beloved Sydney band &#8211; and looks uncertainly to his own musical future. Interview by <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3036655/420x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There&#8217;s been a lot of waiting &#8211; ? and <em>waiting</em> &#8211; for Royal Headache to follow up their 2011 <a href="/releases/2000931">self-titled debut</a>, which topped our <a href="/articles/4393992">Readers Poll</a> that year and launched the Sydney band in a big way overseas. And we followed them <a href="/search/?q=royal+headache">all along the way</a>.</p>
<p>In the past couple years, though, Royal Headache have been unusually quiet. There&#8217;s been competing talk that A) the band are finished, and B) they&#8217;re finishing their second album. So which is it? According to lead singer Shogun &#8211; whose eager, soul-spiked vocals and shirtless live presence were as clear a calling card as the band&#8217;s scratchy scrambling of garage and punk &#8211; the answer is &#8211; both. Royal Headache are done, he told <em>M+N</em>, but they&#8217;re finishing the second album. Shogun even mentions touring to launch it, adding to the mixed messages.</p>
<p>The reason for our long, startlingly candid interview isn&#8217;t his absent band, though. It&#8217;s his debut solo gig this month as part of Vivid LIVE, where he&#8217;ll be singing and playing acoustic guitar while accompanied on piano by his friend Gabrielle De Giorgio (who plays in a Queen tribute band). During our revealing and surprising conversation &#8211; punctuated by his housemate setting off a firework next to him &#8211; Shogun questions his entire relationship with music.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a name for the solo project?</strong><br/>
Shogun. [<em>Laughs</em>] Just Shogun. It&#8217;s just my songs. I don&#8217;t really need it to have bells and whistles. I think music would be better off without that stuff. It&#8217;s just me playing my songs that I write in my room.</p>
<p><strong>Is it daunting to think about debuting this intimate project at such a prominent event?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Well, I guess it&#8217;s up to me whether I&#8217;m daunted. From one angle it could be outrageously daunting and maybe I don&#8217;t belong. Maybe the whole thing&#8217;s gonna be a bit of a nightmare. But I like my tunes, y&#8217;know? I&#8217;ve got the feeling people will enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Will it just be newer stuff, or will you do some Royal Headache stuff?</strong><br/>
I might do one or two Royal Headache songs, just to fill it out. But I&#8217;m not sure which ones. I&#8217;m gonna practise quite a few. I&#8217;m playing a short set &#8211; I think I&#8217;d be more nervous if I was playing for longer. I&#8217;m only playing for like 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll play more solo shows after this; I&#8217;m not too sure. But I think these are some of the better songs I&#8217;ve written, so I&#8217;d like to share them with people before I get too old to give a fuck. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<blockquote><p>?They sound like Stone Roses songs. But better.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So will it just be you singing and your friend playing piano?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m playing acoustic guitar. They&#8217;re all songs I&#8217;ve written to play and sing on acoustic guitar. They sound a bit like Stone Roses songs. But better though.</p>
<p><strong>All the press release really said was that it&#8217;s ?a soulful side project.? Does it have that soul thing to your singing that people found in Royal Headache?</strong><br/>
No, not really. I was bullied into that. I have no soul. That was an act. [<em>Laughs</em>] No, I&#8217;m joking. It&#8217;s quieter stuff, so I think it&#8217;s a little bit more from my interest in, yeah, stuff like Stone Roses and English pop and mod. I think the influences are a little bit more from that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Without having a full band, are you paying more attention to your singing?</strong><br/>
I always pay attention to my singing. And I&#8217;ve always played acoustic guitar and showed people my songs. It&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s entirely new to me, singing and playing an acoustic guitar &#8211; I actually really like it. It does have the potential to be really boring, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessary. I think it&#8217;s a nice, intimate way of experiencing the delicate nuances of a song when you just hear someone singing on their own like that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of hearing fucking effects on everyone&#8217;s voices and instruments. I think everyone&#8217;s leaning on them too much and I&#8217;m looking forward to just doing the bare bones a little bit.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>How far back does the name Shogun go?</strong><br/>
When I was 14 I had a slumber party and my friends were teasing me and calling me a shogun. I told them to shut up and they said, ?Shut up shogun.? They said that all night. So it started as a dis but then it became my name. We were watching this Sean Connery movie and I think it had a shogun assassin or some shit in it. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=saalGKY7ifU">had] a cleft palate and lip, and I had speaking issues more when I was younger. I had a really heavy emphasis on my ?sh? sound, like a Celine Dion [?My Heart Will Go On?</a> sort of &#8211; the way she does her ?I see you, I feel you.?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a high school nickname. There&#8217;s nothing too special about it. I tried to get rid of it but it stuck. It&#8217;s fine. What&#8217;s in a name? Nothing. That&#8217;s why I just call it Shogun. I don&#8217;t give a fuck. Honestly, I think names and trappings and expectations have really destroyed music so actually, when I think about it, I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting up somewhere and just playing with my normal name that my friends call me. [<em>Interrupted, then shouting aside*] Fuck off, cunt. You fucking idiot! My fucking ears! Fuck off! [*Talking into the phone again*] My housemate just set off a fucking firework next to me. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Is that a regular occurrence?</strong><br/>
Yeah, more or less. Not that but something of that nature, yeah &#8211; I&#8217;m fine &#8211; my ears are just ringing a bit.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=477128011/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://royalheadache.bandcamp.com/album/stand-and-stare-give-it-all-to-me">STAND AND STARE / GIVE IT ALL TO ME by Royal Headache</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the status of Royal Headache and the second album?</strong><br/>
I left. I left the band and the band&#8217;s over. I told everyone we [split up] but people act like they still don&#8217;t know. I just thought it was really clear that we broke up. But it doesn&#8217;t matter; people shouldn&#8217;t be obliged to know. But we&#8217;re gonna finish the album. It&#8217;s coming along fine &#8211; it&#8217;s nearly done. I&#8217;ve done most of the vocal tracking and the instruments were tracked ages ago &#8211; over a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>But you&#8217;re not gonna play live to launch it?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ll do a tour, yeah. I guess we&#8217;re sort of obliged to because whoever puts it out, they&#8217;ll want to sell records. I don&#8217;t know. It was fun &#8211; it&#8217;s just, all things come to an end. That was not a band that was supposed to be around for very long.</p>
<blockquote><p>?That whole bloodsucking world &#8211; it&#8217;s not something I wanted to subject myself to.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So that was your reason for leaving? That you saw it as a quite finite thing?</strong><br/>
No, there were lots of reasons. Being in a band and touring a lot and drinking a lot and losing yourself and y&#8217;know &#8211; not really having real friends and that whole bloodsucking, revolting world &#8211; it&#8217;s not something I wanted to subject myself to for too much longer.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there&#8217;s a way to still do the band but avoid that stuff and keep it pure in a way?</strong><br/>
No. I don&#8217;t know &#8211; I really don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything pure about rock ?n? roll. You&#8217;d need to be very, very strong-minded, and I am not.</p>
<p><strong>Well, I guess if you&#8217;re at least open to doing a tour, people can see you one more time.</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. That&#8217;s fine. If people are still interested. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if people want to see us any more or if people are interested in music like that any more. I&#8217;m not very excited about music today. Y&#8217;know, Royal Headache was a response, in a way, to the fact that the musical environment of the time was exciting and there were bands I wanted to play with and people I wanted to play too. And I don&#8217;t really feel that way any more &#8211; I haven&#8217;t really heard a decent Australian release in about three years.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of those bands you wanted to play with?</strong><br/>
Straight Arrows, Kitchen&#8217;s Floor, Low Life, NOTV [Naked on the Vague].</p>
<p><strong>Straight Arrows have a <a href="/news/4654578">new record</a> coming out.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s true.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Are you happy with how the first album came out?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I was really, really disappointed with it at first because I was just being a baby. I actually really wanted it to sound like the early Straight Arrows records. I wanted it to be much noisier. In the spectrum of garage-y punk it&#8217;s actually pretty clean. It&#8217;s not that murky or swampy. I think in time I grew to be okay with it. I listened to it the other night and it sounded okay. Sometimes I listen to it when I&#8217;m stoned just to see what I think. I thought it sounded pretty okay.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad people liked it. People appear to have enjoyed it and had a good time. People have come up and said to me they really liked the record &#8211; maybe it meant something to them &#8211; and that&#8217;s really nice, to do something that someone sees as meaningful. That&#8217;s hard, musically, I think. It&#8217;s really, really hard to invest it with any real worth, as opposed to just some kind of ear dildo that&#8217;s gonna be forgotten about in 15 minutes.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We were a pretty dysfunctional band, mostly because of me.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The space [of years] between the two albums: was that just from touring so much and then you leaving the band?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a number of things. We were a pretty dysfunctional band, mostly because of me. I was drinking a lot and being an asshole, and I was never happy with anything. It was difficult &#8211; just difficult to see a point to any of it sometimes. But we were a very dysfunctional band. Sometimes we didn&#8217;t communicate properly. There was other shit happening in my life which was terrifying, so that was preoccupying too.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like a lot of things compounding each other.</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. It was good though. It was a good time. It was just sort of everything at once.</p>
<p><strong>When you did <a href="/news/4456476">the tour with The Black Keys</a>, what was it like playing venues that big? Did you feel out of place or did you just go for it anyway?</strong><br/>
I did feel out of place and I didn&#8217;t really go for it. There was nothing to go for, really, if you know what I mean. There was this enormous stage. It was a really tough room to warm up. You&#8217;re singing to 10,000 people who wanna hear ?Lonely Boy?. Black Keys fans are never gonna be Royal Headache fans.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned not liking much new music. Do you listen to a lot of older music right now then?</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been listening to?</strong><br/>
Everything, really, up until about the mid-?90s. I guess my favourites would be stuff like Stone Roses, Small Faces &#8211; obvious stuff, really. New Order. Mostly UK stuff &#8211; I find Americans a bit annoying, musically. Just old obvious crap that any  old-fart kind of burnt-out dickhead in his 30s would listen to. Everything from British Invasion to Madchester.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>What are you doing in terms of work and outside of music right now?</strong><br/>
My parents give me a huge allowance. [<em>Pause</em>] I&#8217;m just kidding! I work in a call centre. I&#8217;ve worked in the same call centre for nine years. I have a teenager&#8217;s job. I have no future at all &#8211; anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this solo gig is the start of something?</strong><br/>
Honestly I have to say I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m really unsure. I wanna do this show and then just see how it feels. See how people respond. I wanna do this show exactly the way I wanna do it, because if I keep doing music from this point on, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m gonna do it. I don&#8217;t wanna have to bow to current tastes. So if people don&#8217;t like me the way I am, I&#8217;m not interested in doing it.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m gonna try it. There&#8217;s every chance it could be disastrous, but that doesn&#8217;t frighten me. It will just be an indicator of which way to go from there on. I&#8217;ve already publically embarrassed myself so many times I can&#8217;t remember, so it&#8217;s not a concern to me. </p>
<p><strong>As long as you&#8217;re doing what you want to do. It&#8217;s better to fail at that than succeed at something you don&#8217;t want to do.</strong><br/>
Yeah, fuckin? A. I completely agree. And sometimes Royal Headache &#8211; towards the end at least &#8211; did feel like me succeeding at something I didn&#8217;t wanna succeed at. That was fucked.</p>
