                <h3>Daevid Allen co-founded the Soft Machine and Gong, hung around with Jimi Hendrix and William S. Burroughs, and remains a hugely influential figure in psychedelic music.

Beat poet. Experimentalist. Artist. Musician. Pioneer. Visionary. Daevid Allen is all these things and much more. However, he is more or less unknown in his home country when he should be considered something of an eccentric national treasure. Then again, it didn&#8217;t take too long for Allen to realise he was perhaps too weird and misunderstood for the bleak cultural landscape of 1950s Australia. After leaving Melbourne in ?59, Allen jumped on a cruise liner to Europe and, once relocated, co-founded the legendary bands the Soft Machine and Gong.</p>
<p>After personally discovering Daevid&#8217;s music and diverse bands as a teenager in Townsville, I was immediately inspired by the sounds he&#8217;d created. I started with the Soft Machine&#8217;s debut, worked my way through the still groundbreaking Gong records and further through the discography in his self-made cosmos. These were records that pushed the possibilities of pop music by incorporating wild effects, arrangements, intricate time signatures and sometimes fictional spirituality with a heavy dose of good humour. And at that early age when I found out he was from Australia, I was even more inspired and curious as to how this man became such a pioneering figure in art rock &#8211; progressive and psychedelic &#8211; and how he managed to achieve it all coming from such an isolated and somewhat backward time period in Australia. </p>
<p>Many years later, having relocated to Sydney, I was surprised when my friend Gumroy, a didgeridoo player from Circular Quay, informed me that on a trip to Byron Bay a few years earlier he met a wild-eyed, white-haired wizard at the local bar, The Rails. This man invited Gumroy back to his house for a drink and a toke and started pulling out photos of him playing with Jimi Hendrix. With a few more descriptions here and there, it didn&#8217;t take me too long to work out who it was. From that moment on, I set out to find the man in question, who was living somewhat reclusively (perhaps not by choice) in northern NSW.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Allen seems to have retained the playfulness of his earlier years.? </p></blockquote>
<p>In the quiet town of New Brighton, just up the coast from busy Byron Bay, I arrive at a place next to the post office on River Street called the <a href="http://www.yumyumtreecafe.com.au">Yum Yum Tree Caf?</a>. Opposite the street is a flowing river and the majority of the patrons are, for lack of a better word, easy-going hippies. I find myself here because of my need for closure and curiosity to have some questions, which have bugged me since a young man, finally answered.</p>
<p>I made contact with Allen through getting in touch with one of his bands, the primarily American-based <a href="http://www.universityoferrors.com">University of Errors</a>. After back-and-forth emailing he agreed to meet with me, although there was one minor setback, which could have delayed the meeting even further. A few weeks earlier the 76-year-old musician took a fall outside his house on wet cement and fractured his shoulder. While I was waiting at the caf?, he was on the way back from the doctors.</p>

<p/>
<p>The car pulled up and out jumped a man named Howie Cooke, a painter and photojournalist for the infamous Sea Shepherd crew and longtime friend, neighbour and currently personal driver to Allen. Slowly from the passenger side emerges the strikingly tall figure of Daevid and the most immediate thing I notice is his youthful, alert eyes. Despite being an old man, Allen seems to have retained the playfulness of his earlier years that you can hear throughout his music. He says he never forgets people&#8217;s eyes. In fact, the Gong album set for release later this year, <em>I See You</em>, is all about that concept, according to Allen.</p>
<p>They sit down and we order tea. It doesn&#8217;t take long before they frantically start telling me there&#8217;s a war going on in their neighbourhood, and I&#8217;m entered right into the battlefield. ?There&#8217;s protests against the CSG [coal seam gas] mining going on at Bentley near Lismore right as we speak. If it goes ahead, this whole place is going to be ruined. There are people from all over in the community out sitting in front of the machinery! Arm yourself with a picket,? says Cooke.</p>
<p>After Howie gives me the environmental rundown, Allen quietly leans towards me with a big smile and says, ?So, man, what do you want to know?? </p>
<blockquote><p>?The rhythm of his voice moves like a jazz flute.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the next 20 hours I&#8217;m so engaged and inundated by information that I don&#8217;t even bother to turn the tape recorder on. The rhythm of his voice moves like a jazz flute and it gently drags you by the ears and into the next sequence. We started from the beginning: life in Australia in the ?50s and his desire to escape. ?You could more or less count the bohemians on one hand. An exciting thing was happening though with the <a href="http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/push">Push</a> movement.? The movement was a forward-thinking left-wing intellectual collective based primarily in Sydney but also in Melbourne. ?When I eventually got on a ship to Europe, I noticed a couple of stowaways on the vessel were friends of mine from the Push movement. I had to hide them in my cabin from the captain!?</p>
<p>Arriving in the UK, Allen eventually befriended folks from the Canterbury Scene &#8211; ex-private-school boys Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers &#8211; and formed friendships with such influential artists as Terry Riley and William S. Burroughs in Paris. ?I was just busking around trying to sell newspapers and poetry; Terry and I were fiddling around with tape loops and collaborating. We formed a very strong and influential relationship between one another. Now spending more time in Paris, Burroughs had me provide the backing music for a live performance of his novel <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Ticket</em>That_Exploded">The Ticket That Exploded</a></em>. </p>
<p>The French thinkers and pioneering figures of the Beat Generation that had inspired Allen to leave Melbourne ultimately became the artists that he moved in with in Europe. Keeping in contact with friends he&#8217;d made in the UK, he co-founded the Soft Machine &#8211; an awe-inspiring psychedelic jazz-fusion outfit that toured with the likes of Jimi Hendrix as well as rubbing shoulders with some of the era&#8217;s most lauded figures. ?We played at Brigitte Bardot&#8217;s wild party in Saint-Tropez and played the track ?We Did It Again? for about four hours straight &#8211; the people loved it.?</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tGz5xPXydcg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Later in our discussion, Allen reflects on how it all came about in the first place. ?Kevin Ayers just found this rich corporate American who took a few tabs of acid and started throwing money at us to make this band. He was just a madman, you know? He thought we were going to be the biggest group in Europe, which for a while there is more or less what happened.? He takes a sip of his tea. ?But then we all burnt out after the US tour and it all got a little too serious for my liking.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?I heard the cry of an animal coming from outside. It was Robert [Wyatt].?</p></blockquote>
<p>Being a fan of Robert Wyatt, I asked him about the tragic occurrence that happened to their drummer and singer that put him in a wheelchair, as the often-spoken-about story would finally be told from a man who witnessed it. ?We were all at this party and Robert was fiddling about with a girl in the bathroom and banging on the door was the boyfriend of the girl. Robert took a quick exit out the window and fell two stories.? He pauses. ?Keith Richards had just walked in with these heroin vampires and it just made the whole scene very morbid. Then I heard the cry of an animal coming from outside. It was Robert.?</p>
<p>Allen, Kevin Ayers, their landlord <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady<em>June">Lady June</a>, Daevid&#8217;s longtime creative partner and long-term lover <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilli</em>Smyth">Gilli Smyth</a> came to his aid. ?We just tried to keep him comfortable until the ambulances arrived. Then of course his horribly painful time in hospital spawned his great work, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock<em>Bottom</em>(album">Rock Bottom</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>Once we finished the tea at the Yum Yum Tree Caf?, we walked back down the street to Allen&#8217;s house. The bottom storey of his place has been rented out to a local musical couple that make up the group <a href="http://www.dinkumbohos.com">Dinkum Bohos</a>, who play in the surrounding regions performing jazz, blues, gypsy and world music. At first I was a little surprised to hear he didn&#8217;t own the house and that he had to rent out the lower level to two local musicians.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3039345/640x360-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Heading upstairs, Allen&#8217;s top storey is of modest size, with a small couch, a bookshelf and lots of concert posters from his long career. He has a small recording room where he plays guitar, his own bedroom and a spare one with empty boxes. There&#8217;s photos of him with Japanese bondage girls, wearing costumes and old photos from the ?70s &#8211; he&#8217;s got sheets of poems on the walls (including by his former neighbour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves">Robert Graves</a>) and his own drawings and illustrations alongside them. He gets us both a coconut water from the fridge and sits down, slowly nursing his fragile arm in the sling.</p>
<p>?We might pop over to see Gilli and Orlando later this afternoon.? Gilli Smyth, a founding member of Gong, a writer, solo artist and performer otherwise known as Mother Gong (or Space Whisper), lives just down the street with their son, Orlando, who is currently mixing the latest Gong record. He also plays drums in the live band and plays in many bands around the area. I ask him about Gilli.</p>
<p>?I was with this other girl at the time in Paris, and she was a full-blown alcoholic. One night her and I just went and got married for the pure fact that her father would give us some money if we did. She was out of control and after the wedding she celebrated by throwing furniture outside our hotel window. She was a lunatic, you know? A real drunk!? he laughs, reflecting on the memory. ?Anyway, we got the money and bought a boat in one of the canals in Paris. We bought the boat off this woman Gilli, and immediately she and I had a connection. My first wife&#8217;s alcoholism got out of control and I ran off to Majorca with Gilli, living side by side poet Robert Graves in an artist village up in the hills.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?Creativity in lovemaking is far more appealing to me. It&#8217;s like music, how different rhythms work to make a song.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Allen&#8217;s colourful relationships with women pop up from time to time during our conversations, and he goes into one of his most recent ones, a radical feminist poet named Stefanie Petrik (a.k.a. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ReVerse_Butcher">Reverse Butcher</a>), who was 27 to his 72 when he met her. ?She had been an established performance poet, collagist and art activist since she was 18.?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this worried his family and friends, as Allen was five decades older at the time, and she too at the time was a head-shaven lesbian activist and highly visible wild child.</p>
<p>?It was quite funny, you know? I took her on tour to the UK and Robert Wyatt&#8217;s wife and Steve Hillage&#8217;s wife were so disapproving of the whole thing. Robert loved it! While their wives just shook their heads in disgust. We had an unbelievable connection right from the start and I don&#8217;t see how age should really be a huge factor ignoring such a strong connection with another person. Robert once nudged her at a concert and asked her, ?What made you wanna climb the steep and perilous mountain that is Daevid Allen?? Stefanie instantly replied: ?POETRY!? For Robert this was the perfect reply.? </p>
<p>Allen also goes into the various wives and wild experiences he&#8217;d had over the years with younger women. Including one with a fetish stripper in America who would pull Hare Krishna flags out of her vagina on stage. ?Yeah, the sex was crazy, man, you wouldn&#8217;t believe. But you know? I&#8217;m more curious about the artistic and uniqueness behind sex like the WHY and the HOW to why someone would pull Hare Krishna flags out of their vagina. It&#8217;s a lot more than just getting your rocks off. The creativity in lovemaking is far more appealing to me. It&#8217;s like music, how different rhythms work to make a song.? </p>
<p>To some people, hearing this from a 76-year-old man would be slightly disturbing. But Allen says it with such gentlemanly conviction that I can&#8217;t help but nod my head and take it all in. He says it with genuine belief that he believes in the art of everything.</p>

<p>Allen formed Gong in rural France in commune/cult-like conditions after he was refused entry back into the UK. This forced him to leave the Soft Machine, but he counted it as a blessing. ?Oh it was great, because of the success with Soft Machine all these great French musicians just wanted to play with me. So we packed them all up and we all shipped out to rural France and just jammed away and partied.? Allen says finding his saxophone/flutist was an interesting experience. ?We found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Malherbe">Didier Malherbe</a> in Deya living inside a cave, and around this time he was a pretty bad heroin addict. He used to show up in a taxi spaced out and completely lost wearing his pyjamas, you know? But we eventually got it together to make a few records.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?These records provided an escape for me and somehow broke the conventions of the schooling institution.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The recommended Gong starting point for beginners is with the somewhat legendary Flying Teapot trilogy of <em>Flying Teapot*, *Angels Egg* and *You</em>, all unique works of psychedelic art pop and spiritual jazz rock. They still hit me with the same mystery and bizarre adventurousness that I experienced in my bedroom after school. These records provided an escape for me and somehow broke the conventions of the schooling institution, just as I imagine it corrupted the school students in the ?70s to burn their homework and drop acid.</p>
<p>Perhaps it even revealed a world to me outside of the somewhat narrow-minded culture of Far North Queensland. To my developing ears, this music was still as highly relevant today as it was back then, and it was certainly more exciting then the shit they played on the local radio stations. These records seemed to spawn from not only Allen&#8217;s creative mind but also the psychedelic drug intake and otherworldly experiences of the band on the commune.</p>

<p/>
<p>?Drugs have played a big part in my creativity, and I remember the Easter Sunday where I dropped acid and everything just fell into place, you know? The mythology of Gong and all of that. I had this one girlfriend Clarissa who just went wild on the acid though; she took too much and would just walk around Ibiza speaking in tongues. The problem with becoming some sort of figure for psychedelic music and all these people are dropping acid, they think I&#8217;m responsible. The majority of my life has been looking after crazy women.?</p>
<p>As well as there being many Gong records, Allen has a considerable body of solo work with art rock/folk albums like <em>Banana Moon*, *Now is the Happiest Time of Your Life*, *Good Morning</em> and so on, each hardly repeating the last and moving in an often strange but forward motion, even if dangling on a tight rope of genius and insanity. With all the success he&#8217;s had overseas, I ask him if he resents the neglect in Australia.</p>
<p>?Oh, not of resentment; what&#8217;s the point in that? Virgin tried to push the Gong records in the ?70s and it didn&#8217;t work over here, so why would it now? I will mention that one of the few times there&#8217;s been interest I got a call from the ABC wanting to do an interview. It was dreadful, after the excitement of possible exposure after all these years the journalist just wanted to rant about the hippie communes around Mullumbimby and this area here. He would say, ?What good have the hippies done around here?? And all this right-wing nonsense. It&#8217;s because people like him feel threatened so perhaps the outsider broadmindedness of Gong just didn&#8217;t go down with Australia at the time. Or maybe it was just too weird for Australia. It doesn&#8217;t really bother me. I don&#8217;t have any money though, clearly; just look at this place.? He laughs, looking around his living room.</p>

Later in the afternoon, Howie Cooke picks us up again and we head down the street to Gilli&#8217;s place. Her home is filled with character and shrouded by lush rainforest. It&#8217;s like the small cottage you&#8217;d imagine from Hansel and Gretel. As we enter, a gentle figure sits at a wooden table with flowers and books everywhere: ?Oh hello there, I&#8217;ve been reading about chaos theory all day.? She turns to the doorway as we enter. Gilli is just how I imagined her, like a sweet harmless soul that gives off a witch-like mystic aura. We go into the studio where Orlando is mixing the latest record in the other room, which is soundproofed, and the latest record is sounding better than ever.</p>
<p>Later in the night I question Allen on the punk movement which members of famously resented progressive rock (Johnny Rotten in particular). ?Yeah, I was at a Boomtown Rats concert and Bob Geldof pointed at me and my mates in the crowd and said, ?Kill the hippies.? But it was fucked, you know? Cause at the time I was playing in a punk version of Gong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About<em>Time</em>(New<em>York</em>Gong_album">Planet Gong/Floating Anarchy 77], banging around the place in a bus just playing everywhere for next to nothing in America. Then in New York we did [New York Gong&#8217;s] <em>[About Time</a>)</em> record. Good things were happening back in Australia though, you know the punk scene in Brisbane and all that. The band <a href="/search/?q=Primitive+Calculators">Primitive Calculators</a> was wild, man, they didn&#8217;t give a shit what people thought or if they were liked.?</p>

<p/>
<p>Allen moved back to Australia in 1981 and settled in the area where he lives now. He never found the same success he had in Europe, where he&#8217;d spent the prior 20 years, but he continued to write and record and tour abroad as he does now. A master of creative networking, Allen has collaborated with many people over the years, more recently he got in contact with Japanese psych-rock band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid<em>Mothers</em>Temple">Acid Mothers Temple</a> after his then 27-year old girlfriend turned him onto it.</p>
<p>?Yeah, I got onto them and they said they&#8217;d love to do something. So, I was in Seattle with the University Of Errors and these three Japanese dudes come in with long black hair over their eyes. They got on stage, didn&#8217;t say anything to me, we hadn&#8217;t even met, they plugged in and just went wild, so I turned up my amp and did the same thing. It was just walls of noise; the people in the front row must have never recovered.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?Football is like jazz, you know? It&#8217;s like improvisation out there on the field.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Allen claimed in the late ?70s progressive rock got too serious and expensive, with gear and lugging things around, which is why he left Gong. Of course one too many acid trips, a psychedelic meltdown and a fairly toxic band life had something to do with it too. </p>
<p>After farewelling Gilli and Orlando, we head back to Allen&#8217;s house and I make pasta with salmon, capers and dill and we have a few beers in the living room. I ask him about Ivor Cutler and Spike Milligan and the playful absurdity that his songs often contain. ?Well, they definitely had a different sense of humour to Australians over there at that time. I connected with that more than the standard Aussie yobbo humour.? </p>
<p>Howie Cooke calls up and tells Allen that they&#8217;re playing Japanese speed metal on Bay FM and he immediately goes and changes the radio station in the kitchen. He pops on his reading glasses and we watch the football and he talks about being a longtime supporter of Arsenal. ?Football is like jazz, you know? It&#8217;s like improvisation out there on the field. When you score, it&#8217;s like nailing a fucking ripping guitar solo.?</p>
<p>With his fractured arm and a cyst on his neck needing to be removed, Allen is a bit sceptical about the tour later this year. ?Well, we&#8217;ve got 30 or 40 dates to do and if they don&#8217;t fix me up soon, I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to do it.?</p>

<p/>
<p>Allen has to sleep upright on his couch. Besides the neighbours downstairs, he lives alone but is never alone, with friends and family in the surrounding area. Not to mention a few young girlfriends here and there. When he leaves the area, he&#8217;s constantly busy playing shows overseas night after night to sell-out crowds right around the world. Later this year he will be playing Glastonbury if his physical health improves. When he comes back to Australia, Allen jams in the basement downstairs with his tenants and local friends and family and performs poetry in and around the area. The community spirit of New Brighton gives off a spiritual sensation to me as a visitor, as the early Gong records gave to me as a listener. Allen remains successful in Europe and the US when touring, and Gong&#8217;s 13th album <em>I See You</em> will be released later in the year.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s home to him in a country he ?never really felt connected to.??</p></blockquote>
<p>He says it&#8217;s always comforting to return to New Brighton on the northern coast. It&#8217;s home to him in a country that he ?never really felt connected to? &#8211; it makes me think that maybe if the country had connected with him, it would be a whole different story. </p>
<p>The next morning I get dropped off the next morning at the Brunswick Heads bus stop by the tenants downstairs. As I leave the house when the sun is rising, I notice Allen is wide awake, sitting upright with his arm in the sling on the couch as he can&#8217;t sleep flat with the injury. He delivers me a grin and he says thanks for dropping by and I can tell he genuinely means it. The shock of having a 24-year-old turn up on your doorstep must have come as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>After an explosive 20 hours of conversation and charisma, I can&#8217;t help but leave feeling completely satisfied, knowing that Daevid Allen was just as wild, passionate and inspirational as I hoped he would be. </p>
