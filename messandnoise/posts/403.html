                <h3>Ben Andrews from My Disco talks to <strong>TIM SCOTT</strong> about their reactive new single ?Young?, their deliberate change of pace and ?locking in? Albini for the follow-up to their 2008?s album &#8216;Paradise&#8217;.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3009287/400x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
After two critically acclaimed albums and a clutch of singles, Melbourne three-piece My Disco &#8211; seemingly tired of descriptors such as ?angular?, ?minimal? and ?post? &#8211; have decided to try something a little different.</p>
<p>The result is &#8216;Young&#8217;, an epic instrumental jam that clocks in at 10 minutes, 50 seconds. Released as a limited edition 12? and taking in elements of kraut and progressive rock, &#8216;Young&#8217; is a departure from the taut and tight songs found on their 2008 record <em>Paradise</em>. However, it still retains the hallmarks that has made My Disco so great: contained but spot-on instrumentation; repetition; and a near-psychic connection between guitarist Ben Andrews, his brother Liam on bass and drummer Rohan Rebeiro.</p>
<p>?We wrote &#8216;Young&#8217; as well as the new songs on the upcoming record really gradually,? explains Ben. ?We were getting a bit sick of the minimal references that were being used all the time. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious reaction against that but we wanted to do something that was all a bit more high energy. With &#8216;Young&#8217;, we extended it to make it what it is.?</p>
<p>And extend it they did. Ten minutes of blissed-out rock that grows from a Neu!-style jam to a heavy repetitive beat. But as Ben explains, its early incarnation was even longer.</p>
<p>?When we first started we jammed it out to like 15 minutes but when we recorded it we did three takes: one was six minutes, one was eight and one was 10 or 11 minutes. There is a lot of improvised sections where we&#8217;re just trying to get the most out of it.?</p>
<p>So how long does it go for live? ?We know the first section of the song &#8211; it goes for a specific amount of time &#8211; and then it&#8217;s up to Ro [Rebeiro]. We have to listen to the drum changes. When we hear him go into this particular section we know it&#8217;s near the end.?</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the b-side is just as interesting: a remix by friend Qua (aka Cornel Wilczek) that tweaks the song enough, but retains all the urgency of the original.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;ve never done a remix and thought it would be cool. Qua got it back to us within like a week. It was pretty much the first take he did &#8211; It&#8217;s just a coincidence that it&#8217;s nearly the same length. We were worried that he was going to do a three-minute radio mix and we&#8217;d be the first band in the world where the remix is actually shorter than the original,? he jokes.</p>
<p>And the name &#8216;Young&#8217;? A reference to the new sound or to producer Mikey Young who recorded their last song for a split 7? with US band Young Widows?</p>
<p>?No real reason, it had a bunch of names. First, it was called &#8216;Welcome to Yamagata&#8217; after this cool poster that this dude made for us when we went to Japan. Then it was called &#8216;Toughen Up&#8217;, and even &#8216;Australia&#8217;, because someone said, ?Oh play that song it sounds really Australian.? I think they were talking about the energy level because normally we are [generally] more subdued.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?We were worried that he was going to do a three-minute radio mix and we&#8217;d be the first band in the world where the remix is actually shorter than the original.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Having finished writing the new record, My Disco are about to launch the single before embarking on a US tour with Young Widows. They will take time out halfway through the tour to return to Steve Albini&#8217;s Electrical Audio studios in Chicago, where they recorded <em>Paradise</em>.</p>
<p>?Yeah, we&#8217;ve locked in Albini. It&#8217;s actually pretty cool. We do five or six shows then five days recording then eight more shows. For us that&#8217;s a short tour. It&#8217;s the shortest we have ever done overseas. We own a whole backline in the US and keep it with a friend in Louisville [Kentucky], so it&#8217;s going to be pretty easy. We are going to the South and the Midwest; places like Louisville, Athens, Atlanta, North Carolina &#8211; the weirder less popular places &#8211; then we are doing New York, Philly and DC.?</p>
<p>Touring North America, however, has been both a blessing and a curse for My Disco. Last year&#8217;s tour was cut short when bags including a laptop and a passport were stolen from a show in Toronto, making it impossible for Liam to cross the border and continue playing with the band.</p>
<p>?It went from a great show where we had sold a couple hundred bucks in merch to a crazy situation where somebody &#8211; we don&#8217;t know who &#8211; stole the bags from behind the merch table. To make matters worse, the bouncer was trying to kick us out when I went to the bathroom to look for the bags. It got to the point where I was getting a bit rowdy and smashed the bouncer with the box of T-shirts. </p>
<p>?I was so livid and angry. I just turned on him,? Ben recalls. ?It seems that every fucking tour some bullshit like that happens. So I got banned from the bar, we lost all our shit and we couldn&#8217;t get back to the States because Liam&#8217;s passport was gone.?</p>
<p>While Liam flew back to London to sort out his visa, Ben and Rohan limped over the border with seven east-coast shows still booked.</p>
<p>?We had a few options,? explains Ben. ?We could just wait in New York for a week and spend money while waiting for our flight to the UK; we could go on tour with Young Widows and sell merch; or we could go on tour and play with Evan from Young Widows helping out on bass. In the end we said, ?Fuck it. Let&#8217;s go on tour. If it&#8217;s shit, it&#8217;s shit, but at least we&#8217;re getting paid.??</p>
<p>Despite the unfortunate circumstances of their last tour, Ben says the band still enjoy travelling and playing in the States. ?We love the States. The more we&#8217;ve been there the more we enjoy it. I don&#8217;t know what it is. It&#8217;s pretty weird. I don&#8217;t know how people live there to be totally honest.?</p>
