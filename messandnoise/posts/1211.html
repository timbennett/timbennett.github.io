<p><strong>Fair Maiden</strong><br/>
?Lady of Fortune? (single, film clip)</p>
<p>Fair Maiden, I&#8217;ve said to no one in particular but certainly myself, are a hidden dagger. From 2008 Ellen Carey has been performing her songs as Fair Maiden, with revolving help from many Adelaide musicians. Fair Maiden&#8217;s debut is out sometime later this year and has been so, so long coming, but so worth the waiting due to the extreme success and utter intrigue Fair Maiden has become. Carey comes on somewhere between Kate Bush in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never<em>for</em>Ever">Never for Ever</a></em>, Nancy Sinatra <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=C2PbG6KQKsE">as Phaedra</a> and Karen Dalton&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=raLXnnlPI_I">?Katie Cruel?</a>. I am a-gush. (Don&#8217;t change that; it&#8217;s a word I made up). </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Body Horror</strong><br/>
<em>Odd Filth</em> EP</p>
<p>Recorded to be achingly slow, warped and bending out of tune, released when the band had fragmented and moved interstate, and sounding really removed from what the group produced in their live formation, <em><a href="http://dedicationloop.bandcamp.com/releases">Odd Filth</a></em> is unsettling and can be heartbreaking whether you know it yet or not. From Adelaide, featuring deep soul and 12-string guitars, I never got around to writing what I wanted about this recording. What I want to communicate is that by defected nature, I default into hearing every song as a love song, and with these songs there is no effort, just immense pleasure in falling, flailing and failing.</p>
<p><strong>NUN</strong><br/>
<em>Nun</em> LP/?Evoke the Sleep? (single, film clip)</p>
<p>I got to <a href="/releases/2001341">review</a> the NUN album when it came out. I like most that NUN is a band, with all people and machines layered densely and clocked in to move like a metal arachnid. The songs are weird pop/rap/electro hybrids. That is weird, and something kinda new for Australia too. Jenny Branagan is a contortionist on stage, performing with bite and near hysterical conviction. My favourite songs are ?Terrormaze?, ?Cronenberg? and the threnodic, mind-bending opener, ?Immersion II.? </p>

<h2>Lawson Fletcher</h2>
<p><strong>Strict Face</strong><br/>
?Fountains?/?Highbury Skyline?</p>
<p>Forged in the urban fallout of UK garage by young people of colour in East London in the early 2000s, grime has recently enjoyed resurgent attention across the global club underground. Grounded in functionalism but embracing experimentation, grime is almost now the default sonic template and production methodology for emerging club producers. An unlikely outpost: peer down past the hills of Adelaide and you&#8217;ll find a young artist quietly rearranging the expectations of what exactly might constitute a grime track.</p>
<p>Whilst the classic eight-bar structure, giddying sense of negative space and sawtooth synth sound remains intact, the tracks showcased on this double A-side perform a kind of cosmic hollowing out of grime, peeling back the signifiers of aggression in favour of a celestial, melancholic fugue state. Not only does he possess the finest chords in the game, on ?Fountains? and ?Highbury Skyline? Strict Face also demonstrates an uncanny knack for suspending percussive elements in zero gravity, making each hit a sonic experience unto itself as much as a node along a chain of rhythm. Released by fellow celestial grime expert Mr Mitch (known for his ?peace edits? of club tracks) on his <a href="http://gobstopper-records.co.uk">Gobstopper</a> imprint, this EP is a prime example of the flexibility and emotional range of club music in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Victoria Kim</strong><br/>
?Kilo Kicks? feat. Divoli S&#8217;vere (Rinse FM rip)</p>
<p>Rinse FM rips are a classic trope in the online circuits of underground club &#8211; not only evidence of a co-sign from <a href="http://rinse.fm">one of the most respected institutions in the scene</a> but also a way for producers to share new dubs in a form that is pretty much guaranteed not to be ripped itself by overeager hypebeast DJs. It&#8217;s a tricky practice from a fan&#8217;s perspective, a delicious morsel of a much bigger meal promised at some unknown point in the future whenever the opaque workings of the industry deign to release the full track.</p>
<p><a href="/news/4580046">Victoria Kim</a> &#8211; a ?Seoul via Sydney? production outfit &#8211; earlier this month uploaded an archetypal Rinse rip: their track is mostly obscured by the mix in and out of bookending songs, but what is discernible is a straight-up club weapon. Featuring an on-point vocal take by the inimitable Divoli S&#8217;vere, a figurehead in the ballroom genre which itself is lightly referenced here, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vkim/kiko-kicks-ft-divoli-svere">?Kilo Kicks?</a> is a great introduction to VKim&#8217;s self-described ?Asian House?, a melange of club-ready kicks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D&#8217;tournement">detourned</a> drum breaks and snippets of East Asian pop-cultural debris. I&#8217;m psyched to hear the full thing.</p>
<p><strong>Lorde</strong><br/>
?Tennis Courts? (Flume remix)</p>
<p>A slight detour into the upper echelons of the EDM world, by way of the two biggest trans-Tasman exports of the past couple of years. ?I promised I&#8217;d do a remix for Ella. Couldn&#8217;t be happier with it :)? tweeted Harley Streten when he dropped this track out of nowhere in April &#8211; and as a glimpse of his project, now a good year or so after he took a jagged, insane leap into global dance superstardom, this remix is actually really promising.</p>
<p>Realtalk: <em><a href="/releases/2001165">Flume</a></em> (2012) was fairly useless &#8211; a stylistic hodgepodge of potentially interesting ideas that mostly fell flat due to naff and/or undercooked execution. While this remix is still fairly tacky &#8211; a classically over-reaching electronic take on a current chart hit &#8211; it&#8217;s also evidence of what a bit of life experience, some time learning from a bunch of phenomenal producers and millions of dollars of NASA-level music engineering technology can achieve.</p>
<p>Opening with a fairly ?arty? sample of a telephone-line hold message, Streten successfully constructs an increasingly epic beast that takes the best elements of the now <em>de rigueur</em> trap ?drop? and injects them with a vertigo-inducing, gravity-bending dynamism that is all his own, thanks mainly in part to some killer brostep-indebted synth wobbles and a newly developed understanding of negative space. The effect is a giddying one of the ground dropping from underneath you before suddenly returning to an Earth now splattered with myriad colour. Both these young artists have been unfairly maligned for their precociousness and seemingly irrational shortcut into the mainstream, but a track like this proves the haters wrong. Plus Lorde sings about iPhones.</p>

<h2>David Nichols</h2>
<p>I saw a brilliant show at LongPlay in mid-April: Hot Palms, Lehmann B. Smith, Sui Zhen, truly magnificent music by extraordinary people, a launch for a project close to my heart (and with cheesecake cover art by me), the <strong>Pip Proud</strong> <a href="http://releases.wdybm.com/album/sleeping-jane-hey-gus">tribute tape</a> which I otherwise had nothing to do with and would put as an absolute musical highlight.</p>

<p/>
<p>I have seen two superb shows by <strong>The Ancients</strong>: this year the first one (at Boney) was more superb than the second (at the LuWow) but on the spectrum of superbness, the distinction is like that between Alpha Centauri and Sirius A. I know, right?!</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3039627/420x340-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I loved a <strong>Dave Graney/Teeth &amp; Tongue</strong> show I saw at the Bridge Hotel, Castlemaine, in mid-June. Both bands were at the beginning of kicking off tours, and there were possibly rough edges to the shows, though who knows. True, I&#8217;m always a bit disappointed when Clare Moore&#8217;s not playing drums, even though she was using a hundred different of her other abilities to add texture and even a bit of fine rhythm via a kick pedal and a snare case. Stu Thomas on bass: always a plus. Dave hilarious and insightful as he has always been. T&amp;T are always fine and particularly the current line-up with more delectable texture (Marc, Jade).</p>
<p>Other great experiences this year: two Taylor Project shows, Daryl Braithwaite/James Reyne, Emma Russack/Oliver Mann/Totally Mild at Boney, King Tears Mortuary/Ausmuteants/Bare Grillz at Northcote Social Club, Inevitable Orbit&#8217;s album, <a href=" /news/4643909">Ciggie Witch album</a> &#8230; I&#8217;m going to stop trying to remember now.</p>

<p><strong>Tiny Ruins</strong><br/>
?Me at the Museum, You at the Wintergardens? video<br/>
This isn&#8217;t a proper Tiny Ruins video &#8211; it&#8217;s a live recording by ABC Radio National and the handheld camera is pretty terrible. Still, it&#8217;s perfect and a perfect song. Every time she begins to sing, I&#8217;m floored. Her voice! Best of all is the smile at the end though. So sweet.</p>

<p><strong>The Necks</strong><br/>
Live at Sydney Opera House</p>
<p>I had a long break from seeing The Necks live. I overdid it several years back; I was obsessed. I dragged different people to every show they played for about two years. They were playing a lot around then and I guess I saw them one too many times and something snapped. Which is quite funny in retrospect. Not sure another band could do that to a person? Anyway, this Opera House show was my first in eight years and I went with a ?first timer? again whose mind was blown, naturally. The show wasn&#8217;t as heavy as some of their sets have been in the past, but still: what a journey.</p>
<p><strong>NUN</strong><br/>
?Uri Geller?  </p>
<p>This song brings me some sort of weird energy. I was really sick at the Dark Mofo festival in Hobart and when the cold and flu tablets wore off, this track on repeat was what got me through.</p>

<h2>Doug Wallen</h2>
<p><strong>Ben Frost, Lawrence English, John Chantler, Robert Curgenven</strong></p>
<p>These guys &#8211; <em>these* are the guys. Between Ben Frost&#8217;s <a href=" /articles/4661024">?ecstatic loss of control?</a> on *<a href="/news/4647388">A U R O R A</a>*, Lawrence English&#8217;s encroaching noisiness on *<a href="/news/4658557">Wilderness of Mirrors</a>*, John Chantler&#8217;s modular synth decay on *<a href="/news/4654796">Even Clean Hands Damage the Work</a>* and Robert Curgenven&#8217;s pipe organ immersion on *<a href="http://www.factmag.com/2014/06/17/hear-two-pipe-organ-tracks-from-robert-curgenvens-astounding-new-lp-sirene/">SIR&#8217;NE</a></em>, it could just be a golden age for drone-minded Australian experimental artists. Too bad three of those four are now expats.</p>
<p><strong>Lowtide</strong><br/>
?Wedding Ring?  </p>
<p>I was more than prepared for the shoegazing lushness of Lowtide&#8217;s <a href="/news/4653169">debut album</a>, but I wasn&#8217;t prepared at all for a pop song like ?Wedding Ring?. It keeps with the band&#8217;s signature dreaminess and two-bass pulse, but it&#8217;s more romantic and classic-sounding than anything else they&#8217;ve done. (It&#8217;s also a really, really sweet duet.) Fans of the defining 4AD and Sarah Records rosters will warm to it right away, but so should anyone else with a heartbeat. It&#8217;s not streaming anywhere online yet, but hopefully that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re holding for the next single.</p>
<p><strong>Wireheads</strong><br/>
<em>The Late Great Wireheads</em>  </p>
<p>Slurred, chaotic and brazenly catchy: I love everything about <a href="/news/4647012">the first album</a> from Adelaide&#8217;s Wireheads. It&#8217;s one of those rare records where I feel like I&#8217;ve just got done listening to the best song on it when &#8211; bam &#8211; the next one proves me wrong. Can&#8217;t wait to see them live.</p>

<h2>Max Easton</h2>
<p>Exactly 300 words on 2014 so far:<br/>
Wasn&#8217;t till I heard <strong>Low Life<em>*?s Mitch Tolman spit ?Got me polo on and that? on their first record *<a href="/releases/2001349">Dogging</a>* that I realised how good this year is for hilarious lyrics. That Low Life record is really good; it&#8217;s so good that my whole reflection on the year to date is obscured by it. Other great things said in songs in 2014: ?Let me piss on your rich mother&#8217;s lips? via Jenny Branagan&#8217;s shrill and warbling voice on the **NUN</em></strong> <a href="/articles/4659344">LP</a>, which is also incredibly good. Or Gutter Gods? Allan Cowie barking, ?Life is just a dream? continuously on the opener to *<a href="/releases/2001305">Innersense</a>?s B-Side.</p>
<p>Other great moments include Roberta Stewart&#8217;s hilarious claim that ?I&#8217;m gonna kill you? on <strong>The Friendsters<em>*? <a href="/articles/4644300">7?</a>. In a live setting, **Orion** have been my favourite new band in Sydney, marked by Yuta Matsumura howling ?Why do I care? through a leather-gloved fist in no less than four different intonations. He also has a significant vocal role on the truly creepy **M.O.B** <a href=" /releases/2001345">LP</a>, though few words are reconcilable among its throngs. Nic Warnock&#8217;s narration of various people&#8217;s resume handed over the Repressed Records shop counter on **Ruined Fortune**?s ?Closing Till? is one of my favourite moments of the year. **Scraps** answering her own rhetorical questions in-song on the *<a href="/releases/2001322">Electric Ocean</a>* LP was also a highlight, as was the various empty threats made by Drew Bennett as the ravaged frontman on **Oily Boys</em></strong>? *Majesty.</p>

<p/>
<p>There is nothing funny about Dan Stewart repeating ?ice head / victim? on <strong>Total Control<em>*?s <a href="/releases/2001353">world-beater of a record</a>, but it&#8217;s stuck with me. Add Al Montfort&#8217;s murmuring paranoid calls of &#8220;what&#8217;s he laughing at&#8221; on the *</em>Snake</strong> <a href="http://www.eternalsoundcheck.com/products/snake-snake-cs">tape</a> and that&#8217;s all I can fit into an exact word-count of 300 in order to fit the rules of ?three? things for 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Nathan Roche</strong><br/>
<em>Magnetic Memories</em></p>
<p>When an artist is as prolific as Nathan Roche, they are allowed to be a little inconsistent: releasing three albums in the space of 18months, as well as writing a novel, leaves little time for tasks like editing. <em><a href="/articles/4652060">Magnetic Memories</a></em> is not immune from filler tracks, but with help from The Middle East&#8217;s Joseph Ireland, Roche has produced his most adventurous effort to date.</p>
<p><strong>Collarbones meet Synergy Percussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Collarbones, along with percussionists Timothy Constable, Joshua Hill and Bree van Reyk, transformed their greatest hits into a truly captivating experience. It is a rare occurrence to see a band take such a risk in a live setting and to execute it this well.</p>

<p><strong>Caitlin Park</strong><br/>
<em>The Sleeper</em></p>
<p>I was blindsided by <em><a href="/releases/2001351">The Sleeper</a></em>, Caitlin Park&#8217;s second LP. I don&#8217;t get blindsided by albums often. Park carves her own path, well away from the glut of shit-folk that this country has produced in the wake of Fleet Foxes? ascension, composing tracks honed with impeccable songwriting acumen and compounded by mind-bending electronica garnish.</p>

<p><strong>DZ Deathrays</strong><br/>
<em>Black Rat</em></p>
<p>Since this is their second album and has been recorded slightly better than the first, the thing to say about DZ Deathrays now is what we always say about second albums from greasy young rock bands: ?It&#8217;s more mature.? And that&#8217;s true for the four minutes of <a href="/tv/4627085">?Northern Lights?</a> but only that; what I like about <em><a href="/releases/2001338">Black Rat</a></em> is that most of it&#8217;s every bit as grotty and snotty as they were before. If they&#8217;ve grown up, it&#8217;s only by a tiny increment.</p>

<h2>Luke Telford</h2>
<p><strong>Hammers Lake, live at Tectonics Adelaide</strong>  </p>
<p>Although it was a privilege to attend Unsound Adelaide for the second year running &#8211; and witness glorious sets from Stars of the Lid, Nurse with Wound and the colossal Emptyset &#8211; the most vivid memories of the period relate to the Tectonics Adelaide festival, which occurred in the following days.</p>
<p>The performance by <a href="http://hammerslake.com">Hammers Lake</a> on the festival&#8217;s second day yielded the most striking and unnerving experience I can remember since seeing Rice Corpse up close for the first time. Judith Hamann wrested marvellous, knotted textures from her cello while Vanessa Tomlinson artfully interrogated a range of bowls and cymbals. But vocalist Carolyn Connors proved the most striking element in the ensemble. Throughout, she bubbled, muttered and wailed soberly into the cavernous space of the Queen&#8217;s Theatre. At one point, she began to accompany her vocals by playing a piece of tin foil with her hands, messing and meddling with it to produce nervous metallic rustling, before lifting it to cover her shrieking face. There&#8217;s almost no point describing the effect of the foil rattling in sympathy with the sounds of her staged anguish &#8211; it was bracing and tragic in the way that the best music can be, but also completely unlike anything I have experienced before.</p>

<p><strong>Cured Pink, live at the R.I.P. Society fifth birthday showcase</strong>  </p>
<p>The RIP Society fifth birthday showcase at the Opera House was much more conventional, by comparison. The bands had songs, for one. Most of them had guitars, too. But neither of these elements stopped Cured Pink from channelling their weird grace into the quietly corporate Studio Theatre.</p>
<p>Few contemporary Australian pop groups have quite the same feel as <a href="/search/?q=cured+pink">Cured Pink</a>. A live set from a group like Total Control is beyond infectious, but can feel like fairly one-dimensional, in-the-red guitar rock after a while (on record, the story&#8217;s different). Cured Pink has that same compulsive inventiveness and bloody-minded simplicity, but temper it with the apparent prescience and unselfconsciousness that only the best live bands can muster. Their music is largely improvised around loose structures and this lends the impression that you&#8217;re witnessing near-perfect songs that exist only as a matter of accident. Like Brisbane peers <a href="/search/?q=sky+needle">Sky Needle</a>, Cured Pink seem almost superhuman, live. It will be interesting to hear how their current material translates on record. </p>
<p><strong>Matthew Hopkins, live at the <em>Vent</em> LP launch</strong></p>
<p>Though each of the evening&#8217;s performances were extraordinary (care of Exotic Dog, Monica Brooks and the momentarily reformed Moonmilk), it was a true pleasure to witness Sydney&#8217;s Matthew Hopkins (Naked on the Vague, The Bowles, Half High, Vincent Over the Sink) launch his recent <em><a href="http://matthewphopkins.bandcamp.com ">Vent</a></em> LP to a small, full room at Redfern&#8217;s 107 Projects. </p>
<p>Like his recorded material, Hopkins&#8217;s set laced disintegrating field recordings and turgid sound art with crudely processed mouth noise. The effect is an immersive ambient music that also feels unnervingly visceral and bodily, like listening to Harold Budd&#8217;s darker moments through the wall of the womb. The performance&#8217;s eldritch qualities were accentuated by Hopkins&#8217;s sense of humour &#8211; halfway through the set, he dons a pair of holographic glasses that catch the weirder light in the room beautifully, lending the impression we&#8217;re just looking through a shed window at a very eccentric neighbour going about his day-to-day ritual.</p>
