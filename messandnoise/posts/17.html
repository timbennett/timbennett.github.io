                <h3>Late 2004 I almost shat myself looking at the line up Jack &amp; Dinos Chapman had set up for All Tomorrows Parties. An indescribably unique festival, whereby an artist [be they musical, writerly or visual] picks their ultimate festival line up. 
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002807/440x292-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="292"/><br/>
The Chapman&#8217;s sorted one packed with musical ingenuity  Shellac, Lightning Bolt, Little Wings, Mercury Rev, Silver Mount Zion, Hood, Sun o))) for starters. And a peculiar four-piece based in Melbourne, the unapologetically decadent and endlessly nasty Bird Blobs, retrospectively crowned by coordinators as &#8220;festival highlight&#8221;. </p>
<p>So Bird Blobs, eh? For a brief musical placing think back a good 20 years  breeding the violence and vitriol that rock n&#8217; roll was once synonymous with, over something that could be described as a warped blues infused early post punk. Makes no sense? Good. Musically, you see, they&#8217;re almost indescribable: frenetic and frantic, raw and vicious, and lyrically it&#8217;s all about snarling stories. </p>
<p>Bird Blobs are so in your face that at any given moment you&#8217;d expect frontman Tim Evans to jump out of your stereo and throttle you with masochistic enjoyment. Live he almost does. It&#8217;s recalling that violent aesthetic that featured so prominently in outsider rock n roll from the late 70s/ early 80s  the Stooges, the Birthday Party, the Scientists et al, and doing it with a trademark disinterest to the shit that comes along with playing in a band. They dig the music, <em>their</em> music, and couldn&#8217;t care less about how many babies Triple J had over it, or how many people might be offended by the content. </p>
<p>Hold up. </p>
<p>Thats totally not the game plan youd be checking your <em>so-hot-right-now</em> rock bands against, which is exactly where Bird Blobs fit in  as part of a musical thread of their very own. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re drawing on what we think is interesting and good in rock music, and we&#8217;re lyrically trying to put in things that are totally unique to me. I&#8217;m not trying to sing lyrics that are the same as somebody in America or England or something, I&#8217;m trying to sing about stories to do with growing up in bogan culture, and the criminal culture where I grew up in Australia and particularly Tasmania. The lyrics are a big part of it, particularly the aesthetic and that&#8217;s totally unique to my experience&#8221;, Evans reasons, trying himself to get to the core of his musical existence. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just telling stories&#8221;, he continues. &#8220;It&#8217;s about nasty stories. I mean, there is a bit of a love story in there  boy meets girl and they fall in love [pause] has a car accident, or chops her head off or something. You know?&#8221;</p>
<p>With an impressive Melbourne-based musical heritage Bird Blobs have in their ranks Evans [ex-Sea Scouts], Steve Masterson [Limit of Shunt], Jordan Redaelli and Ian Wadley [both from Minimum Chips], but the resulting sound isnt something you could predict as a sum of their parts, and hasn&#8217;t been since their inception. Starting off as Evans&#8217; project post Sea Scouts, Bird Blobs began as a weird country hybrid  with a self titled debut that has seemingly been forgotten and dismissed &#8211; very much as an adjunct to the <em>real</em> Bird Blobs sound. </p>
<p>&#8220;[It was] inspired by bands I liked, like the Dirty Three, Lee Hazlewood etc. It still had the story aspect to it, but the music wasnt violent and nasty and aggressive. Then I suppose over time I just got drawn to what was more natural for me, which was rock n&#8217; roll and I think violence is an important part of rock n&#8217; roll  I think the great rock n roll bands, there was som violence to their music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then its been two more albums [2003s <em>Stihl Life</em> and 2004s self titled] which have helped garner their unmistakable sound and unrivalled song-telling ability to pick up on an Australian consciousness that has the oz-patriot repressing romantic visions of the criminal. </p>
<p>While it starts with delivery, Evans points out that in a style thats so hard to digest, your content has to back it up &#8211; &#8220;To me it&#8217;s part and parcel to the whole thing &#8211; you can&#8217;t sing in that voice, well you can sing in that voice and sing about flowers and trees and love, but thats not what its about.&#8221; Which is where this band asserts their particular significance as <em>a band that matters*, a band where *everything counts</em>. </p>
<p>From the primal rhythms to the sneering vocals, the unnerving guitar and counter pointing bass &#8211; they&#8217;re all there to serve involved vignettes, with the response from a listener being quite sensory. And fuck its refreshing to have something a bit insightful, albeit implicitly, seeping through in some local lyrical content. </p>
<p>When asked about that Australian consciousness, that bogan culture and the pseudo criminal thread running through it, Evans delves into a bit of history. &#8220;I think we have our own version of it, from Ned Kelly to Chopper to our obsession with crime because our criminal past as a nation, it makes up a lot of our consciousness But to me its an Australian aesthetic and people probably cringe from that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit weird to think that running somewhere deep, under the veneer of perfection that characterizes our lives, theres a criminal-esque inclination. It ruptures our comfy lives, which is difficult to digest and is consequently overlooked. &#8220;And that makes us more relevant here than your average band, because the average band doesnt think about that  they try and sing like Radiohead or something like that&#8221;, Evans continues. </p>
<p>Not your average band by any means, and that they do it with <em>that much* originality and a resounding amount of musical success surely makes them stand out in this country *and</em> abroad. The band itself was named after a painting one of Evans friends painted whilst high on acid. He killed himself not long after. The artwork, Bird Blobs was immortalized forever as the bands reason for being. </p>
<p>The inspiration behind Evans mastermind concept? </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been attracted to those stories, those tales of people doing crazy, violent things. And I was talking to my brother one night and we were exchanging some of these stories and he reminded me of some stories and I was like &#8216;You should write these down, you should write a book, you should do something with these&#8217;. And he turned around to me and said &#8216;What are you talking about, you&#8217;re in a band, you should be singing about this, what else have you got to sing about?'&#8221;</p>
<p><em>BAM! Right there. No more forlorn love stories, or pathetic attempts at recreating a universally bland experience, Bird Blobs give you a lot more to digest in their work  and while it&#8217;s not the most palatable thing youll encounter I guarantee it&#8217;s infused with so much passion and delivered almost to the point of idiom that when you hear it it&#8217;ll infiltrate your brain and be ingrained in your consciousness.</em></p>
