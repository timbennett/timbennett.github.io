                <h3>AirIT, a new government-funded initiative aims to generate more airplay opportunities for Australian music on community radio. As it goes live across the country today (September 30), we talk to its founder <strong>CHRIS JOHNSON</strong> about how the service works.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006716/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>How does AirIT differ from the current model?</strong><br/>
The main service of Amrap [the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project] to date was the monthly CD mailout service. Once a month stations get a package with 30-50 new Australian releases, and we target music to appropriate stations and broadcasters. AirIT is much more interactive because it&#8217;s kinda like an e-commerce site. You browse for want you want and order it. It has some fun Web 2.0 features, user reviews and ?most ordered tracks? charts to make it fun for radio folk to use. It&#8217;s also free.</p>
<p><strong>So how does AirIT work exactly?</strong><br/>
AirIT allows record labels to submit new Australian music to an online catalogue for access exclusively by community radio. Broadcasters preview tracks online, create a playlist and submit it to Amrap. Amrap delivers the music on a CD for broadcast or via digital delivery. By ordering tracks from AirIT broadcasters declare their intent to air the tracks within 28 days of receipt.</p>
<p><strong>Why was there the need for this platform?</strong><br/>
I had been following the transition from CD to digital music distribution for years, firstly as manager of Edge Radio, then as a radio sector consultant. When I started managing Amrap the whole CD to digital transition had become a real sticking point so I wanted to come up with a service that would work for everyone. I came up with AirIT when I realised that the best thing Amrap could do for Australian music was build useful resources for community radio and the music industry. AirIT tackles that challenge while building a new way for the music industry, community radio and broadcasters to support Australian music.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the purpose of the service?</strong><br/>
AirIT will get great Australian music to the airwaves faster by getting the music into the hands of broadcasters who control their own radio playlists. It also forms the backend for a digital music library that community stations can draw from as they transition from CD to digital music libraries.</p>
<p><strong>How do artists contribute tracks?</strong><br/>
At the moment artists access AirIT through their major or independent labels and distributors or through Amrap&#8217;s mailout. Also, if they are recommended to us by a music director from a bunch of stations we&#8217;re working with (such as FBi, 2SER, RRR, PBS, etc) they can get on AirIT that way. They apply for a business account and if approved we send them an online music submission form. They submit the form and post us the music on CD. We then add it to AirIT.</p>
<p><strong>Is the platform open to all artist/labels?</strong><br/>
Not at this stage. First up it&#8217;s for Australian music only. We&#8217;re starting with labels and then we&#8217;ll be announcing pathways for emerging and fully independent artists to access the service. Unfortunately at this stage we just don&#8217;t have the funds or people power to open it up to everyone at once.</p>
<blockquote><p>?AirIT will get great Australian music to the airwaves faster by getting the music into the hands of broadcasters who control their own radio playlists.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Your press release states that only ?eligible record labels can submit three tracks?. What makes a label eligible?</strong><br/>
At this stage labels with at least three signed artists and releasing at least three radio-ready releases per year. We&#8217;re going one step at a time, but rest assured there will be some really neat ways for more Australian artists and labels to access the service soon.</p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s paying for the service?</strong><br/>
It costs a bucket-load to run but it&#8217;s been funded by the Commonwealth Government through the Community Broadcasting Foundation. So if you pay your taxes I guess you&#8217;re kinda paying for it. Money well spent to get great Aussie music to air if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>What stations are involved?</strong><br/>
From October 26 all fully licensed Australian community radio stations are eligible to apply. For the first few weeks a handful of stations will access it including FBi and 2SER in NSW; Triple R, Joy FM and PBS in Victoria; Edge Radio in Tasmania; 4ZZZ in Queensland; Radio Adelaide and 3D Radio in South Australia; RTR in Western Australia; and Caama in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p><strong>How will AirIT benefit stations, artists and listeners?</strong><br/>
It provides greater access to music for stations and broadcasters and it&#8217;s the foundation for a whole suite of new services Amrap will be rolling out to stations over the next couple of years. It creates more airplay opportunities for artists as AirIT makes it easier for broadcasters to find new tunes in the genres they like. Ultimately the listener will benefit from hearing a variety of new music on their favourite stations.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about Amrap, the organisation that administers AirIT.</strong><br/>
It was funded by the Commonwealth Government form 2000-2003. During that time Amrap developed a CD mailout service to get emerging Australian music to stations. When the Libs didn&#8217;t renew funding it ran on the smell of an oily rag until the Rudd Government made it one of their more hip election promises at the last election. My team and I were hired to take the services further, so we&#8217;re building on the mailout service, helping with music grants for stations and developing new services such as AirIT. </p>
