                <h3>Legendary Sydney outfit The Hitmen are back on the road behind a new live album and the final two installments of a career-spanning reissue series. <strong>TREVOR BLOCK</strong> talks to guitarist Chris Masuak about the past, the present, the future and &#8211; Wolfmother.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3007741/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Chris Masuak joined Radio Birdman as a teenager. In 1978, amid the fallout following the band&#8217;s European tour, he and Birdman bassist Warwick Gilbert hooked up with longtime friend Johnny Kannis to put together The Hitmen. They played a passionate and unashamedly ?uncool? version of rock&#8217;n?roll over a period of some years, often doing five shows a week despite various line-up changes and record company screw ups. This period continued until a car crash put a severely injured Kannis in hospital. From then on, The Hitmen were never really a full-time proposition, although Masuak still saw plenty of action as a member of The New Christs and The Screaming Tribesmen. </p>
<p>The occasional Hitmen reunion show and some recording still takes place, however, with the band about to release a live album, <em>St. Valentine&#8217;s Day Massacre*, featuring legendary Detroit artist and singer Niagara (Destroy All Monsters). The final two installments of their back catalogue reissues &#8211; 1984?s *Tora Tora DTK* and 1991?s *Moronic Inferno</em> &#8211; are also on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Niagara and The Hitmen sounds like a marriage made in heaven. How did the album, which you recorded with her at Sydney&#8217;s Crest Hotel last year, come about?</strong><br/>
Well, various people from here have been in contact with, and stayed in contact with Niagara and [manager] The Colonel for a long time. People had said to her she should visit Australia again in connection with her art, and when she did come over she wasn&#8217;t really expecting to play. We just got in touch and said, ?Let&#8217;s do it.? So we did.</p>
<p>I think it [the album] came out really well despite some technical problems with the recording itself. The whole PA that night was being routed through a digital foldback, and there were lots of drop-outs and some awful distortion on the tape. We managed to salvage most of it, which was good, because we only had one shot at this. We had had one rehearsal with Niagara beforehand, though we each knew each other&#8217;s stuff and we had toured together once before, when she was out here with Dark Carnival. And, you know, we got on well during that tour, Dark Carnival were good people. A lot of US bands are paranoid, they seem to think that every other band is out to scam them somehow and they are flabbergasted when you&#8217;re not like that. I remember Iggy Pop&#8217;s band, back when the New Christs supported him on a tour here, they wouldn&#8217;t even go out for lunch with us.</p>
<p>The live recordings were salvaged by a Melbourne producer/sound engineer called Michelle Dilevski, by the way, who did an excellent job. She&#8217;s an amazing lady, actually, great value, although maybe slightly ADHD, but then that comes in handy at times. I liked working with her a lot, she stays completely focused on the project all the time, unlike some people I could name.</p>
<p><strong>The reissues are continuing. There can&#8217;t be much more to come?</strong><br/>
This is almost it. They are getting the usual Savage Beat treatment: double discs, big booklets, photos. [Savage Beat boss] Dave Laing finds all sorts of juicy items, including things that we&#8217;ve never seen or heard and he sends us copies with his ideas about where they might fit and we always say yes. He pieces together all sorts of contemporary stuff from back in the day. These reissues were first proposed years ago and he&#8217;s spent a lot of time getting them together, getting things right.</p>
<p><em>Tora Tora DTK* was always an album for the fans, a pretty straightforward live take on what the Hitmen were like. The reissue comes with a load of outtakes and other extras- different versions, everything. *Moronic Inferno</em> is from 1991. We were touring that on the Dark Carnival tour I mentioned before. You know, I&#8217;m not even sure it actually got a proper release here in Australia. So you get one for the early fans, and one that is the more mature sounding band.</p>
<p>The first Hitmen album [<em>The Hitmen*] and *Moronic Inferno</em> are my two favourite Hitmen records. The first is basically a band live in the studio, that&#8217;s exactly how we sounded then, although listening to some of the live stuff from the time we were much better onstage. And ?Moronic Inferno? is where the band ended up by 1991, when we were crafting things more adventurously. As history as all good things don&#8217;t last.</p>
<blockquote><p>?As a band, we have had so many second chances, and we keep on going, and we can still play. Now we&#8217;re kind of in that zone where we are the old guys but still have as much passion and energy as ever. I&#8217;d like to think we can teach new bands who can pose well but not play.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The band is known for having a pretty turbulent history. Apart from the car crash, does anything stick out for you?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s hard to pin anything specific down. Basically we were just music fans, we played what we wanted to hear, when no one else was really playing it and we could play four or five times a week on the pub circuit, if we wanted. We also took it out to the suburbs, where we played all the time. I think we were just really fortunate that we got to do what we loved. Granted, every band, every artist wants some success but that isn&#8217;t the be all and end all. First and foremost we really just wanted to play.</p>
<p>At the time, we didn&#8217;t have much to do with any inner-city scene. You&#8217;d go to the pub, and see guys who&#8217;d just formed a band, bitching and moaning about how badly they were getting treated. Then a while later you&#8217;d go back, and the same band would have maybe moved up a notch in the scheme of things, and now they were treating newer bands the same way they used to bitch about. There was no cooperation; the next batch of bands always had to come in at the bottom. We used to try and foster some spirit between bands, to get something useful going, and people weren&#8217;t interested. We always wanted to create something special, but in the end we just gave up. It&#8217;s like, if you go out on the road by yourself, so what? But if you put an event together, make it a circus, more people will come.</p>
<p>As a band, we have had so many second chances, and we keep on going, and we can still play. Now we&#8217;re kind of in that zone where we are the old guys but still have as much passion and energy as ever. I&#8217;d like to think we can teach new bands who can pose well but not play. Playing at festivals, I saw so many young bands, most of who I&#8217;d never heard of, and most of them were not that good. They leap about, posing, they don&#8217;t really play that well, but for some reason people accept it, that industry veneer. We&#8217;re not veneer, we are old oak, you know, sturdy.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3007742/440x647-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Wolfmother are probably the worst band I&#8217;ve ever seen &#8211; no, they <em>are</em> the worst. Ever. I don&#8217;t see a lot of live stuff at the moment, I don&#8217;t go out much. I&#8217;m a reclusive old fart, and I love it. I&#8217;m planning on moving to Spain soon, so I&#8217;m going to be even more inaccessible. I love the way Europeans love their rock music. They may not quite get it, but they love it. And there&#8217;s no lines drawn, of age or whatever, they&#8217;ll listen to rock played by anyone. I was over there in August, with The Fleshtones, and it&#8217;s amazing how everyone has so much enthusiasm. There are some places that you&#8217;d expect to find that, like in the big cities, but it&#8217;s everywhere. I like those kind of people, who like new things and are open minded, but at the same time know a bit of history.</p>
<p><strong>The Hitmen used to get a bit of flak for their self-confident attitude.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I remember Rob Younger once saying to me, ?I fucking hate the way you walk, like you own the street.? Well, what am I supposed to do? Cower in the corner? We were copping so much shit, and we didn&#8217;t put up with it, and so to some people we came across as arrogant. But at the same time, we were very generous to support bands. We used to give them the use of our whole PA, all the lights, you know, and say, ?Go ahead, blow us off stage if you can.? We always looked after other bands, because we thought it was important to support each other.</p>
<p><strong>So now the Hitmen&#8217;s legacy is safe and out there. What next?</strong><br/>
I want to take [Masuak&#8217;s other current outfit] Klondike&#8217;s North 40 over to Europe to play. We&#8217;ve got a new album half done, I just need to find a sugar mama to help finish it off. KN40 play the kind of thing I always liked doing in Radio Birdman and The Hitmen, maybe with more harmonies. It&#8217;s kinda like a pared back Hitmen, taken down to a trio.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;d love for The Hitmen to record new material, I&#8217;ve got a lot of songs in store that would work. Like The Dictators have shown, you can record new stuff in the same spirit and people know it&#8217;s the same band. We&#8217;ve got a pretty broad base to plunder for ideas in The Hitmen. We have no limits. You can hear that when you listen to <em>Moronic Inferno</em>, we were pushing things further than we were ever given credit for. </p>
<p><strong>Well, you&#8217;ve got a great precedent for an old band to record new material.</strong><br/>
What? Oh, yes, Radio Birdman. You know, I think <em>Zeno Beach</em> [2006] could have been mixed a bit better, but there was a lot of politics going on at the time, and in the studio. In a band like that, when you reform, it seems like you are expected to revert back to what you were when you first joined, so when I&#8217;m with Birdman suddenly I&#8217;m back to being a 17-year-old dickwad again. But if Birdman could do it, it should be possible for the Hitmen to pull that off. It remains to be seen whether we will actually get to do it.</p>
<p>These re-releases extol the past, they bring the Hitmen back into the popular domain, and I&#8217;m not sure how they will be seen. But the live album with Niagara is new, and it&#8217;s just great. The reviews have been mindblowing. People are saying it&#8217;s better than the stuff she did with Destroy All Monsters. It&#8217;s kind of nice to be put in the same basket as Ron Asheton [guitarist, Destroy All Monsters/Stooges]. As a band we are really really pleased with the reception it&#8217;s been getting. </p>
<p><strong>Your rock contemporary Nick Cave is on his third book [<em>The Death of Bunny Munro</em>]. Would you ever write one? What would it be called?</strong><br/>
Hmm. It&#8217;d be called something like, <em>No One Told Me About This Shit: A Wall-eyed Look at Life&#8217;s Rich Travesties</em>. It would be a book to help you so that, if you had the smallest degree of nous, you could turn to it. And someone who&#8217;d been there would tell you, ?Do not do that?, which might help you accomplish things in a different way. I have thought about writing a book, actually, but I&#8217;m not narcissistic enough. Writing songs is different. That&#8217;s about exploring life and yourself. And, you know, Cave portrays himself as an artiste but to me he&#8217;s just tedious. But he&#8217;s far more famous than I am, so who am I to say?</p>
