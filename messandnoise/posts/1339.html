<h2>?Babylon?  </h2>
<p>?Babylon? was created during sessions scoring music for a short film for some designer friends. When challenged with scoring music for something like this, it tends to open you up further to try something different, especially when presented with a visual to score. This is something quite dark, chaotic, mysterious and enticing. This track is all Aimee [Nash] on guitar, playing over a beat that I had created, but very simple. While it&#8217;s incredibly different to the other tracks, it seemed appropriate to open the album with it.</p>

<h2>?Seventh Moon?  </h2>
<p>This track was one of the early pieces written for the album. One of the first ideas that I had about how this album should be from an instrumentation perspective came from a few pieces that I had written on an old Fender Contempo organ that Aimee had bought. They were slow, haunting organ pieces with an organ bass line. I was very attracted to the idea back then to have only a few instruments/tracks on each song. Very sparse, organ-based, not so many guitars, and not as noisy. I wanted much more space in the mix for Aimee&#8217;s vocals to really stand on their own. </p>
<p>The initial version of this was sitting around for a little while and Aimee was unsure about what she could do with it, as it was very slow. Then I sped it up, reworked it with some demo drums and played it to her. From memory, Aimee came up with this melody and lyric very quickly after that and the vocal take on the album is one of the first we did. That&#8217;s when it really started to be the track it is now. I love Aimee&#8217;s lyrics and melody on this and I&#8217;m very proud of what we have created together here. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big production in the end &#8211; strings, big backing vocals, and choirs. To me it&#8217;s maybe one of the signature songs of the album, in terms of the mood it creates for the remainder of the album.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?The Going Up Was Worth the Coming Down?  </h2>
<p>My own early ideas for the album consisted of some organ pieces and a few acoustic guitar pieces that I had been playing with. This is one of the latter that I had been working on that I was picking on with an alternate tuning. I always wanted to keep this very simple musically, and did right up until the ending, until the cords then turn backwards and it builds backwards with plenty of reversed tracks. It&#8217;s a false ending really. Other than the drums, I think it was all recorded at my place, and all on pretty much first/demo takes. These are also some of my own favourite lyrics, as I like the wordplay that came out here.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193235679%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Bxg7y&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Let Me Be Your Light?  </h2>
<p>This track started with a guitar loop from Aimee, which is the loop that starts the track now and continues all the way through. We then added two bass lines, and for a long time I thought that there would be no guitar on this track (and also much of the album initially). The basis of this track is quite simple: the drums, two bass lines, and Aimee&#8217;s gorgeous vocal. That&#8217;s what drives the song and it was important not to overshadow the vocal, which is why the verses remained sparse.</p>
<p>The next phase of this was adding the more atmospheric sounds. It somehow had to stay simple yet become very lush to create the beauty and further the imagery. Again, the strings, backing singers, and choir all carefully pieced together over a long period of time. Minimal guitars again &#8211; only ebow and a very simple two chords on the chorus. </p>
<p>To me, this was like ?Seventh Moon? in that it really marked a change for us musically and was another early indicator for us on the emotional side of the album.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Santaria?  </h2>
<p>This track was originally just the second half. Although relatively simple instrumentation, it was proving difficult finding the right balance in the mix. While going through the early stage of the mixing process, I had heard the track without the majority of the guitars. (Just the drums, bass, simple tremolo guitar, and organ.) I really loved the simplicity of it and the sound of the drums being out there so much. Once I had heard it, I felt like I had to find a way to use it, and came up with the idea to split it into two parts.  </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193236209%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Y8uM6&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Throwing Stones?  </h2>
<p>This is a song I had written that I was never able to find a great melody for. I think I had been pestering Aimee about it for a while to see if she had anything for it. When she finally sang something down the mic for it, I was blown away at how perfect it was and immediately got excited at the potential for where it would go, and also the opportunity to feature Aimee&#8217;s vocal in a way that it hadn&#8217;t been heard before. It was barebones acoustic guitar and vocal. No studio tricks.</p>
<p>The majority of this track was recorded in a house that we rented in Idyllwild for a few days. Idyllwild is in the remote southern portion of the San Bernardino National Forest above Palm Springs and is about 10,000 feet above sea level. That&#8217;s where we recorded the acoustic, organ, Aimee&#8217;s vocals, and also the basis of the ending. At a later stage we would spend a day at a small studio in LA and record the drums and backing singers for this track. </p>
<p>I love how different this track is both as a song, and from a production feel, to anything that we have done before. It&#8217;s also one of my favourite vocals from Aimee.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?All That We Are?  </h2>
<p>This is actually a track that was written in some form a long time before The Black Ryder existed. One of the first songs that Aimee and I ever collaborated on. Although we were couple and both musicians who had our own bands, we had not written together and didn&#8217;t think that we would at that point. </p>
<p>I had always had a love for it, but it had never gone anywhere or really fit in anything we were doing before. Because I had never forgotten about it, I brought it back to the offering on this record and talked about it with Aimee and also Wes Seidman, who was the co-engineer and co-mixer of many tracks on the album. We sped it up and gave the rhythm a little more movement, and then took it from there. The main vocal has three parts: Aimee on primary, and myself in unison and one octave lower. Again it&#8217;s simple but very atmospheric, with the use of a drone effect and duelling ebow tracks.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of this track was recorded in Joshua Tree, where again we rented a house and set up a studio for about a month this time. This was a very influential time on the creative process of the album. Listening to this track always puts me back in that house and that time.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Until the Calm of Dawn?  </h2>
<p>This song is essentially a dark lullaby. I wrote this for Aimee and it&#8217;s me singing to her during a very tough moment for her where she wasn&#8217;t doing well and had checked herself in to somewhere for some help, which ended up being more of a nightmare situation in itself. It&#8217;s about our connection, the stress of modern life, and in some ways the way we are put in a position where it&#8217;s common to medicate through it.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Le Dernier Sommeil (The Final Sleep)?  </h2>
<p>This piece was an improvisation. It was never ?written? as such. One day I was at Aimee&#8217;s place and was playing with some string sounds. It was really just luck that I had hit record and then just played. This is what came out. Twelve minutes later I stopped recording and looked at Aimee, not knowing exactly what happened or how it happened. I felt like something quite magical had just happened in that I was able to improvise beyond my ability and knowledge, and that maybe this was just channelled through me, or that I was so overcome with emotion that it went straight through me to the music and bypassed the filter of overthought and/or hesitation and doubt about our actual abilities that can happen when playing. That piece is incredibly special for that reason. There are no changes to that original take and no editing.</p>
<p>Much later on, I had met a cellist and string arranger that I assigned the difficult task of writing this out so that string players could then replicate it. The final mix is a blend of the original recording and the real strings that were recorded later. Both Aimee and I loved the idea of closing the album with a 12-minute instrumental string piece, and we never waivered from the idea. It feels like the perfect ending to the ride.</p>
