<strong>What ?walks like love??</strong><br/>
Well, it was just a little aside from an old Etta James song, though I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember which one [<em>?Something&#8217;s Got a Hold On Me &#8211; ed.</em>]. She just kinda scat sings it towards the end of something. It was a phrase that stuck in my head and I always like to start out with the title of a new album first, that and the cover image. I need to have a title and to be able to picture the cover before I work out what songs are going to go on it. Albums come together pretty quickly once I have the name and the image. I like compiling things, I make theme CD compilations for friends, and this is the same kind of idea. If I have an umbrella term or idea at the start I know what kind of songs I want to go on it.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re an actor, a songwriter and a singer. Which do you prefer?</strong><br/>
The songs, definitely. I love the songwriting itself, and then the live performance of them. I don&#8217;t know why, it&#8217;s just what I feel I&#8217;m best at, I guess. I think I get the best results from that aspect. It&#8217;s the most personally satisfying for me too; those other things are just &#8211; added extras. </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been a while between albums [<em>Rock&#8217;n?Roll Tears</em> came out in 2007]. Is that by choice?</strong><br/>
I put out an album every two years or so, and would do it a lot faster if I had the money to do it. I&#8217;d put out an album an year with great joy, if only I could afford to. I can certainly come up with an album&#8217;s worth of material in a year, and I&#8217;m always recording bits and pieces. I don&#8217;t perform live as much as I&#8217;d like to, as the Sydney scene has shrunk it&#8217;s gone from once a week to once a month or so. There are little areas of live music that are thriving but because I&#8217;m not really part of any kind of scene I have create things for myself these days. Things like The Hopetoun <a href="/news/3761449">closing</a> have had a real impact. And of course I saw what has happened to The Tote too. I launched ?Slight Delay? there a few years ago, and it was like playing on hallowed ground, a real thrill.</p>
<blockquote><p>?When playing my own shows, half of me tries to be a crowd pleaser, but the other half doesn&#8217;t give a fuck.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>You do seem to play a fair bit, often with others.</strong><br/>
Doing The Kill Devil Hills tour was fantastic, I love being a support act. I take it pretty seriously, and try to come up with a set of songs that create a mood among the crowd that will work to help the headliners. And when you are talking about supporting people ranging from Ren&#8217;e Geyer to Kill Devil Hills, you are talking very different audiences. But, really, when playing my own shows, half of me tries to be a crowd pleaser, but the other half doesn&#8217;t give a fuck. </p>
<p><strong>How do you choose the collaborators you work with? Some seem long-term regulars, some seem like special guests.</strong><br/>
A lot of it just depends on who is available at the time. It&#8217;s not really a long, thought-out process. I prefer to have a core band that I can play with but I&#8217;m not a machine playing all the time so when I need people I just have to hope they are available. Plus, I like the idea of being like Chuck Berry, just picking up bands in every town or for different gigs. And that way the songs sound different each time too. It&#8217;s tricky to manage at times, though. Every now and again I play solo anyway. Like Penny Ikinger, I&#8217;m always happy to do solo shows but usually I prefer to play with other people.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s things that come up, like ?Gauloises Blue?. That was written in homage to a friend and I wanted to get other people who knew him in to be a part of it. So I asked Tex Perkins and his partner Kristina if they would sing on it. She&#8217;s a good ?ooh-er? and ?aah-er?, and I knew his deep voice would give the song some real strength. And I think that John Cann, the guy who inspired it, would appreciate the fact that they agreed. He was my acting agent, a mad Dylan fan, who smoked Gauloises Blue [cigarettes]. </p>
<p><strong>Do you mind the varied descriptions of your work that pop up?</strong><br/>
Well, yes, they are varied, and funny at times. There&#8217;s not much I can say about that. Those are all up to other people. I guess I must come across in different ways to different people. And I know some of my albums are slow growers, so at first listen someone might only hear something that is a bit country-ish, and so they stick me in that bag, with that label, and it gets repeated. I have trouble putting myself in any one genre. The good thing about the different labels and descriptions, though, is that I can annoy more people by being seen as crossing boundaries. My favourite description of my music is ?soft chaos? by the way.</p>
<p><strong>But being tagged as a ?chanteuse? must be a fair cop after recording the French version of ?Rugged Love And Thin Air?.</strong><br/>
I did the French version because I was asked to have some spare songs ready, a few more than we needed for the album. I got it translated for me by some friends. We recorded it at about 3am one morning with me singing from handwritten notes I had on the proper pronunciation of the words. My buddy [French rocker] Dimi Dero thinks its cute, apparently, and charming. And, of course, I like to pretend I can speak French.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you can carve out a big enough space for yourself in Australia?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not sure, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working towards. Although I think I may have to leave Australia at some stage, the population here is really not large enough to make a full time career viable for me &#8211; or for many others, I should say. And going away is a fantastic thing to do, personally. Plus people seem to be impressed when you come back: ?Wow, you played in London.? But you know, I&#8217;m happy enough here at the moment.</p>
<p>My plan for the next year or so is to try and release some of the strange EPs and other tracks I have been recording. Some are already mastered, some need mixing. I want to see if I can use iTunes to put out a digital-only EP every couple of months and maybe some accompanying vinyl too, but we&#8217;ll have to see how that goes. There is some talk of a possible European tour in August or so, which would be great. </p>
