                <h3>Perth native <strong>STEPH KRETOWICZ</strong> sits down at a kitchen table in London&#8217;s East End with Snowman&#8217;s Joe McKee and Andy Citawarman to discuss their past, present, but not their future.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020049/440x625-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The last time I saw Snowman together was at The Dove Bar on Broadway Market in London&#8217;s trendy East End. It was about six months ago, the night before drummer and bassist, husband and wife, Ross DiBlasio and Olga Hermanniusson were to up stakes and move to Iceland. It would be a powerful blow to a band that had endured the trials of their teens and young adulthood together and it was one that they wouldn&#8217;t survive. The mood was poignant but good humoured, as the disbelief at their approaching end was mingled with the thrill of beginning a new chapter in their respective lives. There was frontman Joe McKee with his upcoming collaborations and plans for a solo project, Andy Citawarman with his growing success in the realms of engineering, Ross and Olga with settling down and babies on the brain.</p>
<p>For me too it would mark the end of a personal epoch. Here was a band that signified my own initiation into the small but exciting Perth music scene of the early millennium. As I was moving on from my love affair with everything punk and garage, Snowman were moving on from theirs. As the <em>Zombies on the Airwaves* EP and the self-titled debut featured all their monstrous metaphors for the blood sucking associated with the jealousy and gossip of a small community, I too was struggling with the parochial attitudes of that most distant Western Australian city. Things soon reached breaking point in 2008, as an oppressive feeling of doom hovered in both Snowman&#8217;s personal lives and the greater global community. A fatalistic glance toward a bleak future produced *The Horse, the Rat and the Swan</em> (2008) and, as legend goes, <a href="/articles/3133488">nearly split Snowman up</a>. Thankfully for some they didn&#8217;t and in reaching new heights of popularity in Australia, along with a growing presence abroad, it seemed like nothing could stop them. It was at this creative apex they announced they would finally make the move to London.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where we find ourselves now, about two years later at the kitchen table in Joe&#8217;s apartment on Broadway Market. Myself, Joe and Andy, haunted by the palpable absence of Ross and Olga. Though it would have made an ideal and highly symbolic end to the band&#8217;s history, the Saturday markets have made it impossible to penetrate the doors of The Dove just across the road. Yet, things have changed and there&#8217;s no point fighting it as Snowman surrender to the fate of what felt like their life&#8217;s work. There lingers a sense of a wound still healing ?throats are cleared, voices lowered &#8211; while touching the painful subject of <em>Absence</em> being their last record. Here, Snowman closes off a trifecta; three very different but exceptional albums, produced by four very different but exceptional musicians.</p>

<strong>In being a fairly self-contained unit for as long as you&#8217;ve been, moving to London and finally going your own separate ways is a pretty cataclysmic thing to happen to you all.</strong><br/>
Joe: Yeah, it&#8217;s affected us in pretty enormous ways. We&#8217;d been writing together since we were teenagers and last year was difficult, to be honest. We all dealt with it differently and we all went our separate ways pretty clearly, which had to happen. It&#8217;s like coming to terms with anything. It&#8217;s been about letting the dust settle and adjusting. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing. It needed to happen, the end of this band. I honestly don&#8217;t really think we could have pushed it any further than it went. It ran its course and we did everything we set out to achieve and more. This whole thing of moving over here, in a way we were all aware that it was to put ourselves in a position that would test us.</p>
<p>Andy: It was an all-in situation: We&#8217;re either all in or we&#8217;re never in. We lost it all, in a way, but we also won because we&#8217;ve made quite a special parting gift.</p>
<p>Joe: That&#8217;s the way it feels. It feels like a nice way to seal it off and it&#8217;s good, being away from where we were. This whole record is about that dislocation, anyway. It&#8217;s a postcard home in a sense. It&#8217;s for those people back there. They&#8217;ve been listening to us from the very beginning and it&#8217;s for them, as much as it is for us, but I&#8217;m glad that we&#8217;re not there because if we hadn&#8217;t have left, then maybe this wouldn&#8217;t have happened but it needed to happen and if we had have gone back it would have been too surreal.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;d been back in Perth, you probably would have stayed a band and stagnated. A lot of the bands that produce the best work are the ones who finished early.</strong><br/>
Joe: Yeah, I think a lot of our favourite bands were probably the same. You see their later work and wonder if there is any point. Something needs to be shaken up.</p>
<p>Andy: Unless you&#8217;re Portishead, who write every 10 years, or Scott Walker.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting what you&#8217;ve come up with, with <em>Absence</em>. Being in London, you&#8217;re living in perceivably more difficult conditions than you would be in Australia, yet you&#8217;ve come up with a clearer, less aggressive, conception for an album.</strong><br/>
Andy: When we first came it was pretty difficult, wasn&#8217;t it? [<em>Looking at Joe</em>]</p>
<p>Joe: Yeah, Walthamstow [in London&#8217;s northeast] was a shithole. Some of the ideas were born as far back as when we were leaving Australia but we hadn&#8217;t jammed any of that stuff out. When we work on a record we build this kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say concept because it&#8217;s not a concept record as such, but we build a world: the realms that the songs need to be in and what sounds we want to create in order to get particular emotions across. When I left Australia, I travelled around Europe for a couple of months and I collected postcards; that was just one of the things I collected at the time. They were just these vicarious photographs that became the guideline for the record and the sounds that I was trying to create. I collected these photographs, not with any intention to make a record around them but, essentially, there was something about them that I wanted to achieve musically. They were soothing. There was something I liked looking at, that gave me some kind of security, even though they&#8217;re quite cold. A lot of them are without people in them and there&#8217;s almost like a removal of something.</p>
<p>Andy: An absence of something. </p>
<p>Joe: That&#8217;s what this whole thing comes from. It&#8217;s about a dislocation of your self from a place, the dislocation of the focal point from a picture or the focal sound from a song. It was about the removal of these things and creating an audio environment for what I would imagine these pictures would sound like. That was what we were texturally aiming to do. I collected them around Europe so that&#8217;s where some of those ideas were born from and then by the time we got back to London we found a place in Walthamstow and we were all living together.</p>
<p><strong>So the album is based on that sense of loss in being removed from everything you once knew.</strong><br/>
Joe: It&#8217;s something that exists and something that doesn&#8217;t anymore. By that I mean the old world that we used to be a part of because it doesn&#8217;t exist in the way that it&#8217;s frozen in our memories. That&#8217;s dead and if you try to communicate with that you&#8217;re trying to hold on to that for security. Essentially, the album is about letting go; the realisation that, actually, that doesn&#8217;t exist and it&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p>Andy: It&#8217;s not only Perth. It&#8217;s also Indonesia and Iceland &#8211; Hopefully people will pick up on that; the Asian influence or whatever it is you hear.</p>
<p>Joe: [<em>To Andy</em>] You sing in Indonesian quite a lot on there. </p>
<p>Andy: My vocal on this album is really in the background, you really need to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>That was another thing I was going to mention because, even in Australia, you come from quite diverse backgrounds as it is.</strong><br/>
Joe: We come from a history of nomads and I think it&#8217;s normal for our families to deal with moving on. Andy&#8217;s family moved over from Indonesia. My family moved over from England. Olga&#8217;s family moved over from Iceland. A generation back, Ross? family moved over from Italy. Before that, my family moved over from Scotland and on my mum&#8217;s side from France and Ireland before that. It&#8217;s just been generation after generation of moving and that dislocation probably runs deep within our DNA.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>In saying that, that sense of absence comes from the knowledge that the place you left behind isn&#8217;t the same as what it was. Do you think, in having written and recorded the album and then returned to Perth for a visit after, that you had a point?</strong><br/>
Joe: Yeah, it doesn&#8217;t exist in the same way as you remember it because you freeze it from when you were there. It&#8217;s changed but not necessarily for the better. It&#8217;s still the same place but it&#8217;s not your place anymore. </p>
<p><strong>Redfern Street [in Perth] isn&#8217;t there as you remember it. Most of your friends aren&#8217;t there?</strong><br/>
Joe: That&#8217;s a good point. All those things are of a time and they pass. They fade and there&#8217;s a real transience to this record too. It&#8217;s all about memories fading and that intangibility. That&#8217;s the other thing about these photographs. They contain this unnameable emotion that I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on.</p>
<p><strong>How was the album actually recorded and over what period of time; there&#8217;s not a lot of guitar in there, is there?</strong><br/>
Joe: There&#8217;s a lot of guitar but it&#8217;s fed through a reverb pedal that has no dry signal, so it doesn&#8217;t sound like a guitar, so there are these cloud of chords.</p>
<p>Andy: But like a really low pitch as well. A rumble.</p>
<p>Joe: Everything&#8217;s treated so it doesn&#8217;t sounds like a tangible sound. We wanted it to be intangible and ghostly because of those unnameable feelings.</p>
<p>Andy: It was recorded in 2009 and in various studios in Hackney. It was a really, really small shitty studio that we demo-ed. We recorded everything and we decided to re-record it for the album but I decided to keep all my parts because I couldn&#8217;t be bothered bringing my keyboard. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<blockquote><p>?We come from a history of nomads and I think it&#8217;s normal for our families to deal with moving on.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Joe: But they sounded good anyway. </p>
<p>Andy: Yeah we thought they sounded good. I kept my demo bits for the album. </p>
<p>Joe: Basically we recorded the album twice and chose the best parts of each.</p>
<p>Andy: It&#8217;s funny because some of the stuff on the demos didn&#8217;t sound better when we recorded them the second time so we started to reuse or recreate the sounds that the demos had. </p>
<p>Joe: Yeah there was a lot of stuff that we salvaged from the demos. </p>
<p>Andy: Aaron [Cupples, producer] took it to the next level after that. Every weekend we&#8217;d go to his house and just brainstorm. Joe probably went there every second or third day. I remember periods of us emailing about it every second day. Pages and pages of ideas of what we thought sounded good or what we wanted.</p>
<p>Joe: It&#8217;s difficult when we&#8217;re not all in the same room at the same time. It can be hard as well. Previous to this album we booked a block of time out, did the record and got it done but this was a much more drawn out process, which is good and bad. It can be frustrating but it meant that the kind of album had a slow-burning gestation period of writing and it was born over a long period of time. </p>
<p><strong>And conversely it&#8217;s a more cohesive album than anything you&#8217;ve done before.</strong><br/>
Joe: Yeah it feels like that. </p>
<p><strong>Can you recreate the sounds that you made on the album live?</strong><br/>
Joe: We could do that, sure but we can&#8217;t we&#8217;re not doing it live because um?</p>
<p><strong>But you were performing it live after you recorded it?</strong><br/>
Joe: No, we never played these songs live. We did in Walthamstow. We played them all live together. </p>
<p>Andy: We showed Heath [Bradby, manager] when he came. We played some songs to him. He had to stand outside and we all played in the small room.</p>
<p>Joe: I forgot about that.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like everything changed because when you were in Perth you always rehearsed in Redfern an then you couldn&#8217;t do that here. You know The XX&#8217;s album came out under a similar premise and that&#8217;s why it sounds the way it does?</strong><br/>
Joe: What, they were all share housing?</p>
<p><strong>No, I think they were still in high school and emailing each other parts late at night.</strong><br/>
Joe: That makes so much sense to me. You&#8217;re a product of your environment and if you&#8217;re trying to shut up because there are people next door sleeping it effects the way you play your instrument. All this stuff was written in a share house in Walthamstow with walls where you can hear people knocking if you make too much noise. So you turn the amp down. </p>

<p><strong>How did you meet Aaron?</strong><br/>
Joe: He used to play in an Australian band called Dan Kelly and the Alpha Males and he produced The Drones? <em>Gala Mill</em> record and a bunch of Dan Kelly records.</p>
<p>Andy: We were playing in Melbourne and he went and saw us a couple of times. I think it was during the debut album phase. He introduced himself to use one time and we got along really well.</p>
<p>Joe: I stayed in contact and we caught up with him at The Dove down the road and explained the idea and he was really keen to make the album. The thing that appealed to us about Aaron was that he could interpret different bands? ideas in a very different way. The Drones? <em>Gala Mill</em> is a very raw, great-sounding record and the Dan Kelly records are really produced with lots of instrumentation and layers and they both sounded great. So we liked that he was able and versatile.</p>
<p>Andy: While we were recording, I remember he was doing some recordings for some techno music I was like, ?Aaron we need to grab some of that shit in our album?, and it actually worked. Some of those things that we wanted to sound electronic actually brought a different aspect to the album. </p>
<p>Joe: He comes from a big electronic music background, you know, an Aphex Twin world. He grew up making that kind of music before getting into recording bands live.</p>
<p><strong>So he totally understands production values.</strong><br/>
Joe: Oh God, yes. The guy is a music whiz. He&#8217;s a bit of a genius when it comes to gadgets and gear. </p>
<p>Andy: Like the ?Triangle song? [on <em>Absence</em>]. The first time he mixed that it was like,  ?Fuck man, this is it.?</p>
<p>Joe: He&#8217;s got this great little tape machine that we fed all the sounds through and we manipulated the tape sounds to get delays and hisses. It basically degenerates the sound in a really unusual way, so it&#8217;s a really good way of breaking the sound up &#8211; You can get some really crazy sounds and he&#8217;s got all these great capabilities to do that. He&#8217;s good with his gadgets, so we had a lot of fun fiddling. </p>
<p><strong>Did you ever play in the same studio or did you each come in whenever you could and do your parts.</strong><br/>
Joe: We did. We went to Red Church Studios and Moloko Studios. We did but the record is pieced together like an electronic record in some ways.</p>
<p>Andy: At the end of <em>Absence</em>, where Ross went mad on the drums and Joe goes crazy on the guitar, it was really difficult to do it separately so we had to piece it all together from an electronic repetition, the way you write electronic music, with the live element of how you would do it live and it worked beautifully. At first we decided we wanted to make it sound live but Aaron wanted to distort drums and stuff but at the end we have a good compromise.</p>

<strong>Who did the artwork?</strong><br/>
Joe: That was Cameron Jones from Walthamstow. Again, it was a similar Redfern vibe, where the artist lived at our home but he lives in Perth now. He&#8217;s from Perth originally but we didn&#8217;t know him when we were there, funnily enough.</p>
<p><strong>Whose doing the video for the single?</strong><br/>
Andy: No one. We don&#8217;t have any money. </p>
<p>Joe: Yeah, that&#8217;s the thing. We don&#8217;t have any money. Moving over here killed us financially as well. If we had stayed in Australia we would have been comfortable touring the same fucking venues, playing to the same faces and it would&#8217;ve been nice. But, I don&#8217;t know, you want to move on. I don&#8217;t want to work with the same people all the time. As amazing as it was working with those people, it was of that time and of that place.</p>
