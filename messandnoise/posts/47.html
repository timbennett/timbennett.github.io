                <h3>The members of the Holy Soul met a few years back at uni, where three-quarters of them were studying music. At the University of Western Sydney&#8217;s music department, it wasn&#8217;t long before they found each other. <strong>KELSEY MUNRO</strong> reports.

Adrift in a world of jazz-funk and nu-metal bands, populated with guys who played in 24/23 time and loved to cover Sting solo songs &#8211; their words &#8211; they literally had nowhere else to go. Ragged and raw, their rough early shows drew some comparisons that were unfamiliar to the band (from the Cramps to the Gun Club); but a favourite cover, The Scientist&#8217;s 1983 classic ?Swampland? more accurately mapped the Holy Soul&#8217;s terrain: somewhere in classic Oz underground swamp-rock and raw, roots-touched classic songwriting via Neil Young and Bob Dylan. Led by the songwriting of big Dylan fan and lead-snarler Trent Marden, the young band sounded old before their time. In a really good way. A super lo-fi EP Love Has Left the City Limits, recorded in a shed, in a day, was released on Reverberation in 2004, followed late last year by their debut album, Sign of the Triangle.</p>
<p>The album, the band say, is ?a sonic upgrade? from the EP &#8211; but only just. It took three days to record, to eight-track tape, in ex-guitarist Tim Malfroy&#8217;s shed, near Windsor in NSW. (Malfroy has since been replaced by the band&#8217;s recording engineer John Hunter.) In a sweltering pub on a Sydney midsummer evening, Marden, drummer Owen Penglis, and bassist Sam Worrad talked to M+N about being in bad high-school metal bands, getting compliments from Glenn A Baker, and &#8211; finally &#8211; address both those Masonic and Christian rumours, engendered respectively by their album title (the all-seeing eye of Mason mythology is encased in a triangle symbol); and their band name (the Holy Soul, remember?). Bear witness: </p>
<p><strong>So why did you record your album to eight-track?</strong></p>
<p>Trent: It sounds good. It&#8217;s cheap.</p>
<p>Owen: Basically we were really happy with the sound of the first one [the EP]. It sounds really ragged. </p>
<p>Sam: We did vaguely want to upgrade sonically a bit &#8211; there was no way but up. </p>
<p>Owen: Sometimes I&#8217;ve recorded in studios before and it just sounds shit. When you record live there&#8217;s an energy there.</p>
<p><strong>So it was a matter of rehearsing and just rolling tape?</strong></p>
<p>Sam: In about three or four hours we managed to get about six or seven songs done with vocals. We did the acoustic songs on the third day with a lot of fucking around. </p>
<p><strong>How did you meet?</strong></p>
<p>Trent: We all went to the same university and we shared the same disdain for funk and jazz and nu-metal &#8211; not jazz, but &#8230;</p>
<p>Sam: A lot of the uni bands sounded like Paul Schaeffer&#8217;s CBS orchestra or something. </p>
<p>Owen: I kind of hate telling people that we did music at uni cos it just sounds like we&#8217;re just a bunch of fucking wankers.<br/>
Trent: Well. We&#8217;ve unlearnt a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>So you hated the same stuff. Was there stuff you all liked?</strong></p>
<p>Trent: We all had an MC5 record.</p>
<p><strong>When was your first gig?</strong></p>
<p>Sam: October 2001. That was at one such event with a lot of bad funk bands.</p>
<p>Owen: We just tried to make the most ragged trashy sound possible. </p>
<p>Trent: And that because we didn&#8217;t know how to play any other way anyway.  </p>
<p>Owen: You&#8217;d have to practice to get good and we weren&#8217;t going to do that. </p>
<p>Sam: Glenn A Baker was there. After the gig Owen and I went outside and played the Compliment Olympics. If someone came up to you and said it was good, you&#8217;d get 10 points, and if they tapped you on the shoulder and said it, it was 20. First person that came up was Glenn A Baker who said [to Owen] ?I loved your caveman drumming!? &#8211; so he got like 500 points or something. But then he snubbed us later on. </p>
<p>Trent: So it was minus 1000. </p>
<p>Trent, what got you wanting to write songs in the first place?</p>
<p>Trent: That&#8217;s like asking ?What&#8217;s your favourite album??</p>
<p>Owen: I can answer that.</p>
<p>Trent: I can&#8217;t. I guess I used to listen to ?Ballad of A Thin Man? and ?Maggie&#8217;s Farm? off the [Dylan] Live at Budokan album, which was probably his worst, and I liked the words because they were just so bizarre, and it rocked out. That was ?78, just before the Christian stuff. I dig his Christian stuff &#8230; I didn&#8217;t listen to the radio much as a kid. When I was 12, I was a big Michael Jackson fan, and then when Dangerous came out (?92, I was 11) I lost all faith in popular music.</p>
<p>Sam: When I was a little kid some dodgy uncle told me that Michael Jackson was going to come to Penrith and kill everyone. And I told my next door neighbour, I was like four, and he just freaked out. It was pretty plausible though, at the time, with that ?Thriller? video.</p>
<p><strong>Did you guys have musical upbringings?</strong></p>
<p>Owen: My dad played banjo incessantly.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230; But not well?</strong></p>
<p>Owen: I don&#8217;t know, when you&#8217;re under 10, any kind of banjo sounds horrible. I&#8217;d walk home down the street and hear the banjo and just keep walking. </p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s lots of symbolism attached to your album title.</strong></p>
<p>Trent: I just thought it was a nice phrase. It means something. What do you think it means? </p>
<p><strong>Well, there is the Freemason symbol, the eye of providence on the American dollar bills.</strong></p>
<p>Trent: Yes. </p>
<p>Owen: I like to think it&#8217;s a reference to the 13th Floor Elevators? first album.</p>
<p>Trent: I don&#8217;t even have that one. It was more of a Prince thing, Sign o? the Times.</p>
<p><strong>Or, in Nazi concentration camps, one rank of prisoner had to wear inverted triangle badges.</strong></p>
<p>Owen: (To Trent) I thought it was because you&#8217;re a Mason.<br/>
Trent: I&#8217;m not. And I&#8217;m not telling you about it either.</p>
<p><strong>Your music sounds like it draws on older, underground Oz sounds like the Scientists and the Beasts of Bourbon. Are you fans of those bands?</strong></p>
<p>All: Sure, yeah. </p>
<p>Owen: Until we started playing, I&#8217;d never listened to the Scientists, or the Gun Club. But then people kept saying ?You really sound like this Fire of Love album?. </p>
<p>Sam: I still haven&#8217;t heard that, but everyone&#8217;s always talking about the Gun Club. </p>
<p>Trent: I like guns, clubs. I come from the country. It&#8217;s accidental, just what happens when some guys get together &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8230; In retreat from funk. Have you played in any other bands?</strong></p>
<p>Trent: Bad high-school metal bands. Nothing substantial. We were in the worst high school metal band, called Seer. Then we had a ?name change? to Sear. </p>
<p>Sam (to Owen): Have you ever seen that video of Trent when he&#8217;s got really long hair, knocking over the amp and stuff, playing Pantera covers?<br/>
Trent: No that was Cave, a Black Sabbath tribute band. I was playing bass. They let me sing ?Paranoid? once in the set, which is why I stuck around. </p>
<p><strong>How does your songwriting work?</strong></p>
<p>Trent: For ?Who&#8217;s Breaking Your Heart? I was at work in the factory and it just came into my head, and I thought, ?Which Hank Williams song is this?? And it wasn&#8217;t. It was lucky. I asked around, have you heard this before? Other times I&#8217;d be walking down the street, just the rhythm of that. ?Dead Town? came from that. Other times there&#8217;ll be lines that sit around for three years and I try and shove ?em in to songs and they keep getting rejected by the songs.</p>
<p><strong>What factory?</strong></p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m not going to give ?em a plug cos I hate the place. But it&#8217;s a book factory. I get to put books in boxes all day. After the first six months &#8230; Oh god, buy the album, please. </p>
<p><strong>It must be hard to rehearse with you all living so far apart (Trent in Mittagong, Owen in Sydney, Sam in Sydney&#8217;s west.).</strong></p>
<p>Trent: Well, we don&#8217;t bother. Have you heard us?  </p>
<p>Owen: I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve had more shows than we&#8217;ve had rehearsals.</p>
<p>Trent: Heaps more. Rehearsals a waste of inspiration. What&#8217;s the difference in the band between when you made the EP and the album? </p>
<p>Owen: We&#8217;ve got more songs! It&#8217;s like we have more of an idea of what we sound like now. </p>
<p>Trent: I could sit here and like, say stuff, but it won&#8217;t necessarily be true.</p>
<p>Sam: It was tempting to make a very clean Kraftwerk-sounding album so the reviews wouldn&#8217;t say the Gun Club anymore. </p>
<p><strong>Are you a Christian band?</strong></p>
<p>Sam: I like it when people think that.</p>
<p>Trent: I really like the idea of people seeing us and thinking what hardcore evangelicals we are. </p>
<p>Sam: Hillsong get all the hot chicks. </p>
<p>Trent: If they ever came to us, we&#8217;d do gigs there. </p>
