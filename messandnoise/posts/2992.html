                <h3>The Onya&#8217;s <strong>RICHARD STANLEY</strong> talks to fellow Brisbanian Ed Kuepper about the reformation of his legendary punk act The Saints, and whether he prefers peanut butter or vegemite on his toast.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002225/440x787-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>For the last reformation, for ?Pig City?, I heard you practised for a week, with the horn section. How much practice have you had for this tour?</strong><br/>
Well, last time we got together we didn&#8217;t practise that much, and we&#8217;re doing about the same this time. A couple of days with the horn section. </p>
<p><strong>When you do these rehearsals for the reformations, do you put any effort into making it sound a certain way? Or is it better to just let the chips fly?</strong><br/>
No, it&#8217;s totally intentional. It has to be, otherwise it&#8217;s totally random isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a combination you know, you have an idea and you pursue that and you aim for something. Along the way, other things will make themselves apparent to you and if it&#8217;s something better than what you initially intended, you go with it. It&#8217;s just part of a natural process as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I don&#8217;t speak for the band on this but this is what I do and this is what I&#8217;ve always done. </p>
<p><strong>With the ?Pig City? gig, a lot of people in Brisbane like to drum up the political significance of Brisbane&#8217;s musical achievements &#8211; how it&#8217;s a coming of age for Brisbane music and that sort of thing. How important is all of that to you?</strong><br/>
I can&#8217;t speak for the city of Brisbane. The only point that I&#8217;d clarify there is that I think sometimes the original Saints were co-opted a little bit, which is fine, and used as some sort of massive reaction against a political situation. From my point of view, it wasn&#8217;t. I had my objections to the government of the time but what I was doing was making music and it was something that was personal. It wasn&#8217;t a reaction against a government. </p>
<p>So I think it being seen now as a significant chapter of not just Brisbane but Australian music is perfectly justified, without wanting to blow my own trumpet, but it was. I&#8217;m happy enough about that but I like to point out that it wasn&#8217;t purely reactive, there was an artistic concept there. Most music that is done purely on a political basis, to me, doesn&#8217;t really cut it. At least I can&#8217;t do it that well. You can make observations but if you want to get into politics, get into politics.</p>
<p><strong>Now that there&#8217;s been a couple of Saints reunions, would there be any real &#8220;point&#8221; to an Aints reunion?</strong><br/>
Well the Aints never broke up. It would depend on a lot of circumstances being right. There&#8217;s no immediate plans to do so. It would be good but some things just happen once in a while. </p>
<p><strong>A friend of mine recently bought from you your original test pressing of <em>(I&#8217;m) Stranded</em> with the different mix and extra song. I was interested to know why you kept it all this time. Are you much of a hoarder or record collector?</strong><br/>
Not any more. I try to keep track of my own stuff and there&#8217;s a fair bit of that. I&#8217;ve collected records over the years but I don&#8217;t listen to that much music while I&#8217;m working, and I&#8217;m working a fair bit. I suppose the things I like to keep are things I got while I was pretty young, and they&#8217;re fairly seminal influences. Apart from that you build up a bit of a wall as you go on in this business. You keep an open mind and an open ear, but I just find it difficult to listen to things while I&#8217;m working on things myself.<br/>
You can become a little bit sponge-like when you&#8217;re listening to things, well I can anyway, and I just like to exclude things just to keep on focus, otherwise it can be distracting. You can listen to something that&#8217;s really a load of shit and you start to think, ?Oh, I&#8217;m much better than this?, so you fall into a complacent attitude. Otherwise you hear something that&#8217;s really good and it makes you depressed. </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re not worried about mimicry showing up in your songs, or anything like that?</strong><br/>
Oh no, I don&#8217;t think I can. I do what I do. It&#8217;s easy enough to get sidetracked and there&#8217;s enough distractions in life as it is, so when I&#8217;m working on writing, or if I&#8217;m recording, I find it&#8217;s better to exclude things and stay focused on what I&#8217;m trying to do and not worry if it sounds like something else, or if it doesn&#8217;t. You have an idea and you just go with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?When the Saints started there wasn&#8217;t any information around, tertiary institutions weren&#8217;t running rock&#8217;n?roll academies, there weren&#8217;t music business courses, so you really had no fucking idea.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m also aware of a copy of the <em>Missing Links</em> LP that you and Chris [Bailey, singer] both used to own. It has both your names written on it, but his is crossed out.</strong><br/>
Is there really? It must be mine then. Tell them I want it back! </p>
<p><strong>Now that you&#8217;re older, what does all of this mean to you? Any difference to what it meant when you were younger?</strong><br/>
The biggest difference is that I&#8217;m still doing it, whereas when I started off I hadn&#8217;t been doing it very long. When I started out it was what I wanted to do and it&#8217;s still what I want to do. The only difference is that I continued to it. In this country in particular it puts me in a pretty rarified area.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see yourself 20 years from now?</strong><br/>
Probably in a hotel room answering questions! </p>
<p><strong>Is there anyone&#8217;s solo career trajectory you&#8217;ve admired, maybe used as a guide for yourself?</strong><br/>
No. Probably the one mistake I&#8217;ve made is that I&#8217;ve never really studied the mistakes that other people made. Looking back on my fairly lengthy career I think it would have been a good thing had I actually been a bit more thorough on some of that stuff. Everything that I did and all the bands that I&#8217;ve been in, everyone had to make the mistakes themselves. I&#8217;ve never really been a rock historian, even though I get the impression in some quarters I&#8217;m seen as such, but I actually know very little about the music industry. Sometimes it would have been good to be a bit more aware of things.</p>
<p><strong>So many bands make exactly the same mistakes. It&#8217;s so easy to see what they are but it&#8217;s just as easy to make them again and again.</strong><br/>
When you&#8217;re busy doing this stuff it is a fairly time-consuming thing.  When the Saints started there wasn&#8217;t any information around, tertiary institutions weren&#8217;t running rock&#8217;n?roll academies, there weren&#8217;t music business courses, so you really had no fucking idea. You really had no idea what to expect unless you had an experienced management association that really had your best interests at heart. We didn&#8217;t and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really had that situation. You find that the people survive the longest are either just outright stubborn or ornery or they have very good business advice, so I guess I fall into the former.</p>
<p><strong>Your approach through the ?80s was to do everything yourself. It&#8217;s possibly the best way to go.</strong><br/>
Yeah, pretty much and it&#8217;s still like that now. It has its benefits. It has some drawbacks, but you can&#8217;t have everything. </p>

<strong>Vegemite or peanut butter?</strong><br/>
What time of day? </p>
<p><strong>Breakfast, it&#8217;s morning now.</strong><br/>
Vegemite. </p>
<p><strong>League or Union?</strong><br/>
Soccer. </p>
<p><strong>Ford or Holden?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s a good question! Mercedes, I think. </p>
<p><strong>Manual or automatic?</strong><br/>
I like the idea of manual, but automatic&#8217;s easier. </p>
<p><strong>Skinny Elvis or fat Elvis?</strong><br/>
Medium-size Elvis, the Nashville stuff, early ?60s. </p>
<p><strong>Devo or Pere Ubu?</strong><br/>
Oh, I like Pere Ubu. </p>
<p><strong>Pistols or Clash?</strong><br/>
Pistols. </p>
<p><strong>Fender or Gibson?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s a tricky one, you know. I started off with Gibson and I love them, but I actually play a Fender at the moment. The reasons for that are purely practical; I&#8217;ve broken so many Gibsons, they have this odd headstock design which goes counter to the grain of the wood so when they fall over, they snap. Whereas a Fender is reasonably indestructible. Check this out on YouTube, you&#8217;ve got The Who where Townsend&#8217;s playing an SG, which is what I used to play, and he smashes it at the end of the show and it all happens in a fairly spectacular sort of way, all fine and dandy showmanship. A year later, he&#8217;s playing a Fender and he tries the same thing and there is no way the guitar gets damaged. There&#8217;s something to be said about a guitar that is that solid, I like it! Sonically though, Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>Red wine or white wine?</strong><br/>
Red. </p>
<p><strong>Vinyl or CD?</strong><br/>
CD for convenience sake. </p>
<p><strong>MySpace or Facebook?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t get Facebook. I don&#8217;t know much about this sort of stuff but I think I have a MySpace <a href="http://www.myspace.com/edkuepper">page</a>.</p>
