                <h3>Gareth Liddiard&#8217;s solo debut &#8216;Strange Tourist&#8217; may be the work of a great lyricist, but it&#8217;s certainly not a pop album, writes EVERETT TRUE.
</h3>

This would have made a great book. It might still.</p>
<p>I feel like I should be throwing a bunch of disclaimers your way. </p>
<p>1) Bob Dylan is often stunning, often not.</p>
<p>2) Traditionally, ?serious? music critics love it when singers with otherwise noted raucous rock bands strip their sound back and ?go naked?, armed only with an acoustic or perhaps acerbic electric for company. This signifies that they&#8217;ve grown up or something: that the bare bones of their songs can stand alone without the noise and bombast. It signifies intimacy (always good) and insight (always good) and an ability to tell stories (of course good) &#8211; stories often being what folk are looking from their rock music. In the ?70s, folk treated rock with immense respect, often unmerited. Musicians and critics miss those days. No one&#8217;s liked the constant blurring of the boundaries that has gone on since then. </p>
<p>This is not a pop record. You can rest easy in that knowledge. So: isn&#8217;t it great that Gareth Liddiard, singer with Australia&#8217;s greatest fucking rock band living The Drones, has made a solo album armed with only a guitar, nine days, a few back issues of <em>The Monthly* and *Soldier Of Fortune</em> and the occasional bottle of whiskey? His voice: malevolent, hectoring, caustic, heritage-sodden, plaintive: seems ideally suited to such an arrangement. He can write the fuck out of a song. He can tell the fuck out of a story. He&#8217;s fascinated by Australian folklore, and can turn that fascination into further fascination for those not so inclined. Right? I thought so as well.</p>
<p>3) I don&#8217;t like rock bands that don&#8217;t rock.</p>
<p>Every song on this album goes on about five minutes too long. Except, oddly, the epic 16-minute closer &#8216;The Radicalisation Of D&#8217; &#8211; a tale partway inspired by the incarceration of David Hicks in Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2001 &#8211; which has dynamics, and power, and the odd scream, and pretty much everything else you&#8217;d expect from The Drones&#8217; frontman. Still, that&#8217;s 16 minutes of genius that gradually sucks you in until you&#8217;re tightly bound to what&#8217;s unfolding in front of your ears, and we should not discount that for one second. Sweet lyrics, too: &#8220;The young boy &#8230; kills a magpie in the backyard/Steals chlorine from the neighbour&#8217;s swimming pool/Puts it in a coffee jar and pours brake fluid in/Makes a pipe bomb using matches and it fizzles when he runs.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?He doesn&#8217;t bother with niceties as a melody or chorus or dynamics, figuring that it&#8217;s way better to focus on the words.?</p></blockquote>
<p>But, for example, the album&#8217;s opener &#8216;Blondin Makes An Omelette&#8217;, the story of the famous tightrope-walker as told by his understudy, reads great on paper with its lines, ?No one cared for him at all until he crossed Niagra Falls/So you&#8217;d all feel a little lower down the scale &#8211; but I ain&#8217;t here because he&#8217;s tall, I&#8217;m only here to see him fall/And if I get on the wagon now it&#8217;ll only be to run him down.? Great lyrics, right? The trouble is, that&#8217;s it. In the studio Liddiard semi-murmurs them to himself like he&#8217;s reminding himself of the story over a rambling guitar line that might just as well not be there, for all it adds to the tale: he doesn&#8217;t bother with niceties as a melody or chorus or dynamics, figuring that it&#8217;s way better to focus on the words. He might be right. But not in this house, not now.</p>
<p>4) It&#8217;s not my fault he&#8217;s set the bar so high. </p>
<p>5) I have immense respect for this man, trust his judgment, love his voice. I may yet change my mind about this: I&#8217;ve held off writing this review for way longer than I would because of this. Mostly, however, this solo album sounds rambling, unfocused, the guitar all plucked arpeggios and breaks for reflection, but not in a meaningful way. In this, <em>Strange Tourist</em> reminds me a little of Bahamian singer Joseph Spence&#8217;s killer early Folkway Recordings and some of John Fahey&#8217;s more muted work: but it sadly doesn&#8217;t ring with the same resonance. (It comes as no surprise either to discover Liddiard has been listening to the work of Toumani Diabat?, a Malian kora player.) Tom Waits tells great stories, but not to the detriment of the music. And Johnny Cash always remembered to write a melody.</p>
<p>6) I&#8217;m not a particular fan of concentrating too hard when it comes to music. It either grabs you, or it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Every song of this album sounds like every other song on this album. The title track &#8216;Strange Tourist&#8217; might be (relatively) a little more upbeat; &#8216;Did She Scare All Your Friends Away&#8217;  a little more plaintive and questioning in its saddened skewering of private obsessions; &#8216;You Sure Ain&#8217;t Mine Now&#8217; sung in a spooked semi-falsetto over even sparser guitar &#8211; but really, if you started listening at any point during <em>Strange Tourist</em> you&#8217;d be hard placed to name the song, unless you were utterly familiar with the lyrics. Maybe that&#8217;s the point? </p>
<p>7) <em>Strange Tourist</em> was &#8220;recorded in an isolated mansion thirty minutes outside Yass, in country New South Wales&#8221; (press release). Well of course it was. I like the pretension here, just not the execution. Some folk would call this sculptured. Can sound be sculptured?</p>
<p>8) These songs are not Drones songs. These songs would not work as Drones song, I&#8217;m sure on that. These songs are Gareth Liddiard songs.</p>
<p>9) Good on him for stepping up to the plate. Fucking good on him.</p>
