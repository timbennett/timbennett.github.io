<h2>&#8216;Double Negative&#8217;  </h2>
<p>This is the first single from the album. This song makes me imagine a sort of dystopian computer game, a maze where all of a sudden there are dead-ends, doorways, walls and pathways opening up in front of you and you&#8217;re kind of just powerless reacting to the environments around you. I like the cognitive dissonance in the lyric ?Red means go? and how that lyric happens, and then we stop, but the guitar goes crazy after the delivery of that line. </p>
<p>&#8216;Double Negative&#8217; is also preoccupied with the idea of being somewhere, and either wanting to stay there (to revel in the slow, cosseted, warm feeling of stasis or nothing changing) or conversely, trying to get somewhere fast and feeling frustrated with ?the lag? of time when you just wanna get somewhere already. We got to play with that idea further in the video we made with Jason Heller.</p>

<p/>
<h2>&#8216;Story Up&#8217;  </h2>
<p>&#8216;Story Up&#8217; is a pop song. It&#8217;s about the mythologies that we build and the stories we tell. It&#8217;s about how we record and maintain our collective histories. Who is in charge of that? Who decides? And I guess also, what is the difference between our lived experience and someone else&#8217;s? Playing music in the Melbourne band scene for 15 years makes you start to reflect on what you are leaving behind, what you might still get to do and also what it is that you have become a part of. But also, frankly it&#8217;s fun to play a pop song sometimes.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Blast&#8217;  </h2>
<p>This song went out to the first wave of pre release press as &#8216;Falling Down&#8217;, which was a working title for about a day before we thought it sounded too depressing. We forgot to tell Joe from Bedroom Suck this and so now it exists in the world some of the time as &#8216;Blast&#8217; and some of the time as &#8216;Falling Down&#8217;. Before that the working title was ?Two Songs?, which was for obvious reasons- it&#8217;s a bit like two songs pushed together. The slow, quieter bits kind of weave their way into the punk bits where the song ramps up again. It&#8217;s a fun song to play and I&#8217;m glad we were able to capture that on the recording. There&#8217;s this moment in the chorus where the balance between the vocals is just right. My voice and Luke&#8217;s voice are pretty sonically different and sometimes they clash and we just go with that because well, that&#8217;s how we sound together. Other times our voices meld without losing individual qualities and this is one of those moments.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Deep Sky&#8217;  </h2>
<p>I remember we had just came back from Perth and I had scribbled something in my diary about the sky looking wider there, and somehow ?deep?, like you could dive into it. This song is about a sort of primal desire to escape into oblivion, to disappear from life. But then it has a positive ending, it turns out all I needed was to tell people that. That was enough. Knowing it and saying it was enough.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188989786&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"/></iframe><br/>
</p>
<h2>&#8216;How You Run&#8217;  </h2>
<p>&#8216;How You Run&#8217; is also a song about being in charge, in control, it&#8217;s about DIY, it&#8217;s about governance, about how you plan your next move, ?how you run things?. When we looked around and surveyed where &#8220;we were&#8221; a few years back we found ourselves to be firmly at the centre of &#8220;how we run things&#8221;. We were in control and ultimately that&#8217;s an intense but good place to be.</p>
<p>Also, to anyone banging on about the fact that they perceive us to sound too much like more well known, established bands from overseas and not  ourselves (only the opinion of some, I&#8217;m sure) It&#8217;s also fair to point out that when you hear that opening guitar line it is just so Luke Horton. I mean it just sounds like classic Love Of Diagrams. C&#8217;mon!</p>

</p>
<h2>&#8216;Photograph&#8217;  </h2>
<p>This is a slower song. The vocals are about finding a photograph on the ground. And then at the end it&#8217;s about a machine (maybe it&#8217;s the camera? I&#8217;m not sure) anyway, there&#8217;s a machine and it is always breaking down. </p>
<p>Luke improvised a great solo over the outro of &#8216;Photograph&#8217;. Now I can&#8217;t imagine it any other way. There are some cool, chiming sort of guitar frequencies that happen towards the end of the song that I&#8217;m fond of too. </p>

<h2>&#8216;In My Dream&#8217;  </h2>
<p>We first recorded this song for a 7? with Jack Farley at Transient Studios in Northcote. It&#8217;s a bit dreamy and a bit pop. We then re recorded it for Blast with Steve Albini because I was curious to hear a slightly punchier, different version. We came home thinking it finished, but then I had some extra ideas for double vocals on the end that I wanted to try out. So we added those with John Lee during the mixing process at Phaedra, and I&#8217;m glad we did that as it&#8217;s cool to hear the extra vocal bits in there. </p>
<p>We actually went into Electrical Audio with 16 songs and there are only 11 on the record, which was kind of hard to pick which ones to use, but it was necessary because of the whole 18-22 mins per side vinyl fidelity thing. (Stay tuned &#8211; we might end up releasing album outtakes as a 7 inch). Anyway, &#8216;In My Dream&#8217; (mark 2) won out and it&#8217;s kinda neat having a few versions of this song hanging around anyway. </p>

</p>
<h2>&#8216;Racing&#8217;  </h2>
<p>&#8216;Racing&#8217; is about adrenaline, being in a competition, danger! Living fast! Which is ironic considering the fact that many of my friends call me ?safety officer? and honestly, we don&#8217;t party that much these days. Luke&#8217;s guitar in the verses reminds me of Stickmen (who Monika and I grew up with and found hugely inspiring), but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s just me who would think that or not. </p>
<p>This song has a tempo shift between verse and chorus where things go from being all revved up to more stretched and sparse and the drums go from being pedal to the metal to easy going. You know when something intense happens, the adrenaline pumps through your body and you feel all crazy and then at some point you consciously feel your body calm down. Well, the perception of difference between those two states is what it&#8217;s all about.</p>

<p>Previously known as ?Luke&#8217;s B Side?, which is weird because it&#8217;s a great song, but in retrospect so presumptuous of us to assume that it was going to be a single B-side or album outtake as soon as we wrote it. It&#8217;s spent most of its life with a working title that suggested it&#8217;s fate but then became something more. </p>
<p>Also John Lee did a neat intro for it this track. He flipped the guitar line backwards for a phrase and then it spins back into focus as the song starts.</p>

<h2>&#8216;S.S&#8217;  </h2>
<p>&#8216;S.S&#8217; is a pretty sad song. I actually wondered if it should go on the record because it&#8217;s so ?personal? sounding and I felt like it might be a downer. But it&#8217;s actually a bit of a mystery to me what it&#8217;s about. I mean, lyrically it&#8217;s gendered. I&#8217;m singing about a ?her? but there&#8217;s no story to it, it&#8217;s kind of a really sad mystery song to me that I needed to write without knowing for whom or about what. </p>
<p>In this track there is the space around the notes so what you get is some respite from other more hell for leather moments on the record. You also get a great sense of the live acoustics of Electrical Audio, which was something we wanted to have on the record. We tracked in a huge room with vaulted ceilings (like three storeys high kind of thing). It was amazing playing and singing in that room. Steve didn&#8217;t put much on my vocals, so you what you do hear on some of the moments on this record where there is more space are fantastic old mics, great acoustics and clever room placement.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Different Way&#8217;  </h2>
<p>I enjoy the rhythm in this song. The bass line sits on the beat in a way that i don&#8217;t ordinarily play and I like that. I think I said to Luke and Monika that it reminded me of Big Star but they couldn&#8217;t hear that, but it&#8217;s something specific about the interaction between bass, guitar and drums that made me think that. Slightly funky (Eek! I said funky!) bass playing or something and then the gush of guitars that follows. </p>
<p>The sentiment of this song is to do with coming at a problem from a new angle but of not knowing what that angle is going to be. I still hadn&#8217;t really tied the lyrics in the chorus down till we tracked them live and they came together quite well. The lyric ?where they fall / Is where they lie? is also to do with chance, of with letting go a bit. If both dynamically and lyrically <em>Blast</em> is concerned with the frustrations of temporality  the fact that we can&#8217;t ever really master time, that we can&#8217;t control how fast or slow things go, how long things take and then how long things will last for, then this is kinda the perfect last track &#8211; it offers the optimistic strategy. Just see what happens and go with the flow! Ha. If only it were always that easy.</p>
