                <h3>On the eve of a pair of comeback shows, The Underground Lovers? Vince Giarrusso talks to <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>* about their early influences, their split with Polydor, working with producer Wayne Connolly and the key to their intoxicating sound.

Instinctive and pure. This is how Vince Giarrusso describes his songwriting partnership with guitarist Glenn Bennie. Together, the pair formed Underground Lovers (often styled as undergroundLOVERS) in Melbourne in 1990, cutting a swathe through the Australian underground with their layered guitar sound and sophisticated forward-thinking approach. Their debut self-financed album, which landed them an ARIA for Best New Act in 1992, was followed by a trilogy of classic albums: the Wayne Connolly-produced <em>Leaves Me Blind* (1992), *Dream It Down* (1994) with Essendon Airport&#8217;s David Chesworth and Robert Goodge and the noticeably stripped-back *Rushall Station</em> (1996), which saw the band reunite with Connolly.</p>
<p>The magic was happening beyond the studio, too. On stage, Giarrusso would often work himself into a trance-like state amid the band&#8217;s dense wall of sound, while live visuals were incorporated from a very early stage. The Undies were always ahead of their time, working electronic influences into 1997?s <em>Whitey Trickstar* (which Giarrusso and Bennie released under the moniker GBVG), *Ways T&#8217;Burn* (1997) and final studio album *Cold Feeling</em> (1999). They toured Australia as main support for New Order in 2002, before taking some time off, although as Giarrusso explains, they ?never really split?.</p>
<p>A <a href="/events/2001941">2009 reunion show</a> planted the seed for a full-scale comeback, which has since come to fruition with a new album <a href="/news/4272518">in the works</a> and a long-awaited retrospective, <em>Wonderful Things*, out through Rubber Records this month. </em>Spanning the years 1990 to 2000, the collection includes singles ?Promenade?, ?Holiday?, ?I Was Right?, ?Eastside Stories?, ?Your Eyes? and ?Losin? It?, and a second disc of rarities and b-sides.</p>
<p>Giarrusso spoke to <em>M+N</em> via email ahead of rare shows in Melbourne and Sydney. Dates below.</p>
<p><strong>Vince, you met Glenn in high school. What were your first impressions of him?</strong><br/>
We were in drama group and part of the drama gang at school so spent a lot of time together, acting up and being the creative types. </p>
<p><strong>Why&#8217;d it take so long to form a band?</strong><br/>
Well straight out of high school we started doing gigs as a duo. We did a few shows at Melbourne Uni. It was more performance-based stuff with music. Then I travelled around Europe and Glenn started university. Once I got back we got a band together.</p>
<p><strong>Was there an instant chemistry between you and Glenn?</strong><br/>
Not sure if it was chemistry &#8211; more instinctive and easy, I guess from working together in drama. In high school we would have parties at Glenn&#8217;s house and we would play music: Glenn on guitar and I would play keyboards with crappy drum machine, a snare drum and sing. We would jam and come up with tunes and song structures. It was instinctive and pure.</p>
<p><strong>Where&#8217;d you find the others?</strong><br/>
We pieced together the band through friends and friends of friends.</p>
<p><strong>Who were the band&#8217;s influences at the time?</strong><br/>
It was older stuff, political and ?questioning? music usually British: The Jam, Clash, Joy Division, Jesus and Mary Chain. Then there was  Talking Heads, Eno, the Manchester scene at the time, New Order, Stone Roses, Ride, My Bloody Valentine, Pixies. Locally, it was older stuff like <a href="/icons/3997199">The Reels</a>, The Birthday Party, The Go- Betweens, Tsk Tsk Tsk and <a href="/releases/2000935">Essendon Airport</a>.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3025139/399x399-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Were you going for a particular sound in those early days?</strong><br/>
Nope. We never thought about it in those terms. We just knew we had song smarts, a great guitar sound, an awesome rhythm section, and an ethereal voice in Philippa Nihill. It was always thinking about the song: What would make the song work better? A guitar sound? A loop? A different structure? A keyboard sound, drum machine or real drums? Of course influences bled through on some tracks but it was always thinking about songs and then songs in extended structures &#8211; taking the listener on a journey.</p>
<p>And we would structure live sets in a similar way &#8211; trying to build tension and then ease off through a set. We started using visuals in a live setting very early on because we wanted the audience to concentrate on the music and lose themselves in it, like we did. </p>
<p><strong>What do you recall of that first Corner Hotel gig?</strong><br/>
It was scary and once we started &#8211; it was over.</p>
<p><strong>Why&#8217;d [original bassist] Stephen Downes leave after one show?</strong><br/>
Not sure. The impression I got was that Stephen was not sure of his commitment.</p>
<p><strong>How important was [producer/engineer] Wayne Connolly in shaping the band&#8217;s sound?</strong><br/>
Very important. We learnt that the studio can be a terrific creative and collaborative space, and the importance of the intricate layering of sounds. That mixing acoustic instrumentation and electronic noise is an art that creates tension which is representational of contemporary life. Also, being in the studio can be fun and funny; a little cocoon.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong><em>Dream It Down</em> [1994] was your last record for Polydor. What caused the split?</strong><br/>
Well, we had a fairly tumultuous time on the major label. Not creatively cause we just did what we did and didn&#8217;t give a fuck what people thought. It was more an administration and management issue. We thought there was a conflict of interest between the label and our management at the time as they were one and the same thing. We thought it was a dishonest and corrupt way to work, so something had to give. And it was us. We had to go. Go figure!</p>
<p>Having said that we were just small fry in the scheme of things as Polydor was dissolved and became Universal and all that inconsequential rubbish that goes on in corporate structures. We were bad at the corporate thing which has to rely on image and personality to sell product. We did try though with hilarious results. I remember one photo shoot with some big shot photographer from advertising and a stylist. It cost a packet! We were pissing ourselves all day. The stylist had very clear ideas about what we should look like. The thought behind it was that we were an international group that had to appeal to an international market.</p>
<p>So we did this transnational photo shoot in some warehouse in South Melbourne near the commission flats. Lights, catering and busy people dropping in and then leaving fast. Eventually, after much angst and discussion, Phillipa was dressed as an Indian Princess in a sari, I had a fez on my head, Derek Yuan was dressed as an LA/Hong Kong hipster, Glenn had a Greek sailor&#8217;s hat and Maurice wore a Driza-Bone coat ala <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=tbkOZTSvrHs">?[You&#8217;re] The Voice?</a>. We laughed all day and drove these people crazy. </p>
<p><strong>Who came up with those strings on ?Losin? It?? Were you surprised by the popularity of that song?</strong><br/>
David Chesworth wrote and arranged the string part in ?Losin? it?. I sang the verses to Glenn when we were in LA in 1992. We had a fairly good idea of what the song was by the time we got to record it. <em>Dream it Down</em> was a tough recording, though. Bits and pieces were recorded all over the place with multiple players playing different parts. Polydor was supportive but there was tension because all this other stuff was going on behind the scenes between the label and our management at the time.</p>
<p>Anyhow we really wanted to collaborate with David Chesworth and Robert Goodge as they were our heroes from Essendon Airport. Glenn and I had seen them play live at Melbourne Uni and at the Clifton Hill Community Centre when we were still at high school. They heard the song and worked their magic on that and a few other tracks on <em>Dream it Down</em>.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Why&#8217;d you feel the need to strip things back for <em>Rushall Station</em> [1996]?</strong><br/>
It was a reaction to all the crap we went through after <em>Dream It Down</em>  was released. Trying to get that record out, being sued; all the ugly stuff. There was great stuff going on as well like good reviews and tons of airplay, getting triple j&#8217;s Australian Album of the Year and ?Losin? It? being in the top 10 of the Hottest 100. ?Losin? It? charted in the Billboard Charts in the US and tracks were picked up for sync rights. But we just wanted to set up, rehearse, book time in a studio and  record. And ultimately we were on our own then. Without a record company behind the band, you quickly realise the support you thought you had in the industry was based on something other than music.</p>
<p>I remember having to do things like ring up regional radio stations and record shops around Australia  to see if they had the record and if they liked it and would they add it to their playlists and sales charts:</p>
<p><em>Hi. This is Vince from Underground Lovers.</em><br/>
<em>Who?</em><br/>
<em>Underground Lovers. We have a new record out, Rushall Station. Have you heard it??</em><br/>
<em>Nah.</em><br/>
<em>Well, as part of our promotional week we can give you a two-for-one deal if you list the lead track ?In My Head? on your sales sheet this week.</em><br/>
<em>In my arse?</em><br/>
?In my head!*<br/>
<em>What was the band?</em><br/>
<em>Underground Lovers.</em><br/>
<em>What was the track?</em><br/>
<em>In my head.</em><br/>
<em>Two for one?</em><br/>
<em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Excruciating stuff.</p>
<p>I imagine the internet has changed that system a lot. The industry has had to become a bit more transparent, but not too much. I often wonder about those illegal immigrants, rich middle-class hipster kids and bored elderly people working the back rooms of corporate record companies, international marketing companies and touring companies clicking on social media sites, internet sites and iTunes in shifts, 24/7, across continents, generating the illusion of volume and the tide of ticking sales. I wonder what the barter system is these days? Flights, accommodation and tickets to events and festivals with a drink card and then what? That dull emptiness until the next hit?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what we wanted to do as a band: fill that dull emptiness with<br/>
music rather than fill music with a dull emptiness.</p>

<p><strong><em>Whitey Trickstar* [1997 as GBVG] was the start of a more dance-influenced path that continued through to [1999?s] *Cold Feeling</em>. What inspired that approach?</strong><br/>
Well, electronic music was always an influence. The use of repetition, drum machines and synth sounds generate a tension and excitement that is representative of modern life. The other thing that was inspiring about electronic music at the time is that it was still quite anonymous. It hadn&#8217;t been engulfed by the cult of personality and celebrity which is what had happened to rock music.</p>

<p><strong>What caused the split in 2002? Did you feel like the New Order tour was the appropriate way to go out?</strong><br/>
We never really split. The New Order gig was just the last one we played. Those nine or so years was a cooling off period after a fairly intense period. We got on with work, projects and families.</p>

<p><strong>What was the catalyst for the reunion in 2009? And why&#8217;d you feel the need to reform?</strong><br/>
We were asked and it happened. Easy and natural.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about the band&#8217;s legacy? Did you achieve what you set out to do?</strong><br/>
Not sure if we have a legacy. We tried to make long play records that you could listen to from start to finish and somehow be taken on a journey.  We tried to do the same thing in our live sets. I know I still think in those terms when writing and structuring songs. It is probably at odds with how most people listen to popular music these days. Although I think there is an audience for long play pieces of music as well as single tracks.</p>
<p><strong>What does the immediate future hold?</strong><br/>
We want to play live and there are a bunch of new underground lovers songs that we want to record.</p>
