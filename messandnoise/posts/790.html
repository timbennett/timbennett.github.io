<h2>?Captain Dies?</h2>
<p>This is the most recent song of all the tracks on the album. Initially it was written as a bit of a lament for an album which I thought I would never finish &#8211; I thought it was dead, actually. But somehow through the process of writing and recording a demo version of this song, I found the energy to re-record and re-write the album a third and final time, and it finally made sense. ?It takes so long for this thing to get done/And you settle on something weirder/Until the war is won.? It&#8217;s about living with something that you&#8217;re not completely happy with, and letting it live its own life. Not just the album. Everything.</p>

<h2>?Highwire?</h2>
<p>I had a pretty simple mission for this song, which was originally a very folky, ?Barbara Ann? sort of thing. I wanted to write and record an uplifting song about finding a new lease on life. Framed of course, in a sort of murky uncertainty. I just wanted to write a really sweet, beautiful pop song to make people feel better if they&#8217;re feeling a little low &#8211; something I&#8217;m not generally very good at. But I think with this one, I captured that spirit a little bit.</p>

<h2>?The Dinosaur Hunters?</h2>
<p>The title is taken from a book I read once about the dinosaur race begun by paleontologist Richard Owen back in the 1880s, I think it was. Once the world realised there was this untapped resource of exotic  prehistoric dragon skeletons to be dug up and sold and bragged about, it became the new gold rush. There were these teams of fossickers called the Dinosaur Hunters who were employed by the paleontologists to do all the dirty work out in the deserts and ice fields. I wrote this song as a kind of romanticised diary entry of these hard-worn, world weary adventurers, underpaid and underfed. But still, the excitement of the fact they were constantly unearthing something new must have been magical. That&#8217;s [Sydney singer] Brian Campeau on the harmony vocal. I am so grateful he came round and got drunk and did that with me.</p>

<h2>?Kodiak?</h2>
<p>This is not a song about a bear. But lyrically I did take the idea of a giant creature that is misunderstood and mistreated and just wants to be left alone by the opportunists, and painted a picture around that. That repetitive guitar stab was originally something I improvised on a loop pedal, and built all the pedal notes around that. Miraculously, every chord I changed to worked with the loop. I ended up multitracking it live, no loops. It nearly sent me mad doing those &#8220;plinks&#8221; but in the end it became a sort of meditation, late in my room that night.</p>

<h2>?Manuscript?</h2>
<p>Originally more of a medieval ballad about a blackbird in the belfry of<br/>
Town Hall, ?Manuscript? evolved into its current form over a few years. I re-wrote it shortly before I went to Melbourne for some gigs with Caitlin Park. Caitlin and I sing together quite a lot and I thought this song needed her voice. I wrote the new melody with her harmony in mind, so she is as much a part of this song as the lyrics themselves. It&#8217;s a bit like two sailors singing into the moonlit night on their last bottle of rum.</p>

<h2>?Sailor&#8217;s Voice?</h2>
<p>I read a lot about ghost ships on the internet one night, and for some reason the concept intoxicated me. I read about this ship called the Ourang Medan which was found adrift off the coast of Indonesia, with its entire crew dead, including the dog. An eyewitness account said the boarding party found the crew &#8220;frozen, teeth baring, gaping at the sun&#8221;. I thought that a pretty terrifying image and fascinating. Similarly, I was haunted from childhood by the line from <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, &#8220;He says the sun came out last night;<br/>
he says it sang to him.? This story reminded me of that.</p>

<h2>?Barking Dog And Swallow?</h2>
<p>When I hear this song I always think of being on a bus between Belgium and France, during the winter of 1998-1999. My Mum was doing a teacher exchange program in Austria and I came over to meet her there and take a little mother-son bus trip. All the roads were completely snowed over and everyone had these disconnected looks on their faces. I remember meeting some girls at a bar in Vienna and they were all going to London where everything was relatively normal, and here was I watching some weird movie on a bus while the world froze outside. I have some really cool Super-8 footage from that trip. I wanted a wintry sound to the song; those percussive sounds are me tapping big crystal wine glasses with water in them, and I managed to get the <em>Midnight Cowboy</em> string sound with a violin bow and an acoustic guitar.</p>

<h2>?This Dead Moon?</h2>
<p>This song is about missing someone.  It was written the morning after the last of the recording sessions for Belles Will Ring&#8217;s <em><a href="/releases/2000872">Crystal Theatre</a></em> in the country. We all had a kind of profound weekend, and I was watching a hawk circle the property we were staying on. I told Liam [Judson] and Lauren [Crew] to come out and have a look. Then the pedal steel kind of takes over my mind and the rest is all feelings, no images. We could never quite get the pedal steel part right, despite three attempts. So in the end I played that last break double-tracked on the Gretsch, I spent three hours finding the right notes. I wanted it to feel as potent as that slide line in ?My Sweet Lord? by George Harrison. But since, John [Kaldor] has pulled out live versions of it that did my head in. I often think, ?That&#8217;s the one.? The song&#8217;s still evolving. But this was the first time we laid it to tape, just me, Dave [Colman, bass] and Danny [Holdsworth, drums]. And I love the recording for that reason.</p>

<h2>?Shoulder Hits The Rain?</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a sort of hymn-like quality to this song, and I&#8217;d never really<br/>
tapped into sacred music before. But I happened to be fascinated by that terribly sad, saturated sound of Christmas carols at the time, and there&#8217;s a whole community of songs in my record collection that rest around that very simple canon-like round of two or three chords. ?My Autumn&#8217;s Done Come? by Lee Hazlewood, ?My Oblivion? by Tindersticks, ?Old Friends? by Simon &amp; Garfunkel &#8211; I had these lyrics in my book for ages, and finally solved the song by removing a whole bunch of chords, just letting it float along. I added the &#8220;Suzanne takes the reins&#8221; coda near the end of recording, and the harmonies more or less took care of themselves.</p>

<h2>?The Crash?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun listening to people&#8217;s interpretations of the lyrics of this song. They&#8217;re in a kind of Maple-Pigeon English: ?You broken arrow and you welcome home.? It&#8217;s as though the protagonist wants to comfort someone after a long hard journey across the merciless sea. Another idea I had in my mind behind the sort of comforting and uplifting melody was the idea of a sense of peace in the face of a tragedy like a car crash or something: ?And in the crash it was hard to tell/The end of the tale.? The song also marks one of the few instances of a distorted electric guitar on the album. I wanted to avoid rock guitar at all costs, but this song called for it I think.</p>

<h2>?The World Is Strange?</h2>
<p>What could initially be taken as a nihilistic song from the title, I think I intended this to be a bit of a meditation on being OK with things as they are. There&#8217;s a bit of mystical imagery in there &#8211; creatures of the air etc. But that isn&#8217;t me tapping into any kind of Tolkien-esque folklore or anything like that, it&#8217;s more about seeing the world as a strange and fascinating place as it is, and finding a peace with things as one often does in the late hours of the night, when all there is to do is go to sleep and dream. That&#8217;s what I meant I think &#8211; let things be for now. Let it die.</p>
