                <h3>He&#8217;s a full-time member of The Stabs, a gun-for-hire for the likes of Love of Diagrams and The Breadmakers and with his new solo project Miniature Submarines already making waves, Mark Nelson tells <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> why he can&#8217;t help but submerge himself in all facets of Melbourne&#8217;s music scene.
</h3>

There&#8217;s an unmistakable dark side to the debut 7? from Miniature Submarines, the solo project of Stabs bassist and itinerant collaborator Mark Nelson. And yet the Melbourne-based multi-instrumentalist calls it his version of pop. Really, it&#8217;s the friction between his gentle, melodic singing and his penchant for gritty guitar and squealing feedback that makes the project instantly engaging. A similar combination of pretty and crunchy is a hallmark of so much ?90s rock, which provides Nelson with ongoing inspiration. But the gloomy noise-pop of both ?The Little Room Under The Stairs? and ?I Heard That You Turned Into A Loser, Baby? doesn&#8217;t recall any one band, which is saying something, really.</p>
<p>The project began as an outlet for Nelson&#8217;s home recordings &#8211; and it is still is, although Monica Fikerle (Love Of Diagrams, Baseball) played drums on the 7?. As for gigs, Nelson has built a rugged lineup in guitarist Greg Kerslake (Mother &amp; Father), bassist Alex Jarvis (ex-Automatic) and drummer Duncan Blachford (ex-Witch Hats). While keeping the live band intact, Nelson aims to play nearly all of the instruments on his upcoming releases, something that shouldn&#8217;t prove too difficult for a guy who plays in at least five bands. A fairly deadpan presence on the phone, Nelson was articulate and often funny while discussing why a project like Miniature Submarines was good for his health.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever interviewed someone on the basis of just two songs.</strong><br/>
There are more on the way, actually. I&#8217;ve started recording the next record. Well, I started a while ago but the computers got stolen. I was working at Jet Studios and it got broken into. People lost albums. I had only recorded three songs, so I lost three. I&#8217;m going to Birdland [Studios in Melbourne] to start again. The next one&#8217;s going to be a 10?. And then an album.</p>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;re sort of working your way up?</strong><br/>
Yeah, well, I&#8217;ve got this batch of songs. The 7? was just to get something out quickly. Looking at my list of songs [after that], it just seemed like a 10?. If I pair them up into appropriate groups, a 10? makes sense. And then [from there] I&#8217;ve got a really good list of album songs with nothing that really sticks out like a sore thumb. I feel like these two songs sleep much better at night on a 7? than they would do among the other songs on the album. </p>
<p><strong>When you re-record the three songs you lost, will you change them at all?</strong><br/>
No. I&#8217;ve demoed them and then recorded them, so in a way I&#8217;ve demoed them a couple of times now. I know how they go, and that&#8217;s how they go. </p>
<p><strong>Does Monika or Duncan drum on the 10??</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m playing all the instruments on this one. The idea for Miniature Submarines is that it&#8217;s a vehicle for my solo recordings. I just didn&#8217;t want to call it Mark Nelson because I&#8217;d feel like a tool. When I demo songs, I do it all myself to see what I can get away with playing. For instance, that drum fill in the chorus-y bit of ?The Little Room Under The Stairs?, that&#8217;s as important to me as the vocal melody. I could demo it well enough to show to Monika, but I couldn&#8217;t play it well enough to pull it off in a recording. So if I need help, I&#8217;ll ask someone else to do it. The songs I&#8217;m recording at the moment are simple enough that I can pull off the drums on them.</p>
<p><strong>Have you always been able to play a few instruments, or is that part of the challenge?</strong><br/>
I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve been able to play lots of instruments, but I grew up playing the organ. I had lessons. And then in high school I had lessons on double bass. So naturally I moved over and taught myself bass guitar and guitar. I&#8217;ve always played bass and guitar in bands. And keyboards. Drums, I don&#8217;t know, I guess I&#8217;ve just learnt by playing air drums in my bedroom. Apparently that&#8217;s how Dave Grohl learnt how to play drums. And I&#8217;m playing viola on these new songs. My sister has one, so she willingly loaned it to me. But I definitely will be getting someone to play my [viola] parts again [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>And live you obviously need a full band to pull off what you did on the record.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I mean, this just started out as a recording thing. But enough people kept asking me to play that the band sort of developed out of that. We&#8217;ve got two guitars, because there&#8217;s always a rhythm and a lead bit in the songs. It&#8217;s cool. Everyone is really down with the idea of me demoing them and then learning the parts off that. They&#8217;re all in other bands, so there&#8217;s no ego or anything. It&#8217;s working out well. </p>
<p><strong>I caught some of your set in support of the Tucker B&#8217;s earlier this year.</strong><br/>
That was Greg&#8217;s first show. He&#8217;s the other guitar player. Chris Smith had been playing up until then. I think Greg did that show with one rehearsal, so he did really well.</p>
<p><strong>Have the other shows gone well?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Since Greg joined, they&#8217;ve been going even better. Because Chris does live in Rosedale [in rural Victoria], which is like an hour away on a V/Line train, rehearsal was a bit difficult. We still don&#8217;t rehearse a hell of a lot, but it is easier with a semi-local in the band.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The Submarines has been a breath of fresh air. It&#8217;s made me way more interested in The Stabs too. I probably would have strangled someone in The Stabs if I hadn&#8217;t gotten to do this project in the meantime.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Had you been recording or playing on your own before this?</strong><br/>
Well, this is my first solo project. Alex Jarvis really encouraged me to do this. He got me to play viola on a couple of songs on his first solo record, and he&#8217;s had me in his band since then, playing bass at his live shows. He just suggested that maybe I should do some solo stuff. Before I did Submarines, I was just bashing my head against a brick wall in The Stabs, it felt like. That&#8217;s why I did this: to satisfy an itch that doesn&#8217;t get scratched in The Stabs.</p>
<p><strong>The two bands are very different, sound-wise.</strong><br/>
Absolutely. That&#8217;s the point for me, really. </p>
<p><strong>The bio on the Rice Is Nice website calls it ?an exercise in pop?.</strong><br/>
I actually wrote that [<em>laughs</em>]. I think I said, ?Unashamedly an exercise in pop.? Yeah, this is my pop band. Obviously these songs would never fly in The Stabs. Anyone who likes The Stabs should be warned that it&#8217;s not another Stabs record. But it&#8217;s music I like and I&#8217;m proud of this stuff. I feel justified in releasing it.</p>
<p><strong>You call it pop, but it&#8217;s got feedback and noise and, for want of a better word, angst.</strong><br/>
Yeah. It&#8217;s probably my version of pop. </p>
<p><strong>It really reminds me of the ?90s. Not any specific band, but that prevailing aesthetic.</strong><br/>
Absolutely. Pretty much everyone says this music sound very ?90s, which I think is a total compliment. I&#8217;m happy about that. That was when I was a teenager. I think I went to my first gig in 1993. Those years when you&#8217;re just like a sponge, soaking up whatever comes your way. I was totally influenced and taught by the ?90s. My favourite bands are Nirvana and Sonic Youth. Probably the ?90s era of Sonic Youth in particular. </p>
<p><strong>Was it weird putting yourself out there lyrically?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve always written songs in other bands. I write songs for The Stabs, so there&#8217;s a few of my lyrics in there. But it can be weird. It depends on how easily the song popped out. There&#8217;s a few, like [?I Heard That You Turned Into A Loser, Baby?], where the song was written around the lyrics. That came from a telephone conversation I&#8217;d had about an old friend of ours who just proved himself to be a loser one night. [<em>Laughs</em>] As soon as I hung up the phone, that popped in [my head]. But there&#8217;s other songs where I have the music and I really have to squeeze out some words. And maybe I&#8217;m a little more self-conscious about singing. It all depends how much confidence I have on a night. </p>
<p>Sometimes I get really self-conscious singing songs where it&#8217;s like, ?Oh, I&#8217;m so sad and lonely.? Sometimes you feel it and you need to say it, but then other times you just feel like a douchebag standing in the corner of the pub singing about your feelings. [<em>Laughs</em>] I guess everyone that writes lyrics goes through this. Sometimes you wish no one was listening to what you were saying for a minute. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008468/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Again, your lyrics are a bit angsty. Do you find inspiration in the bitterness you experience in daily life?</strong><br/>
I guess. Particularly that ?Loser? song. That&#8217;s about one of my main muses. We didn&#8217;t end on fantastic terms. So it&#8217;s a lot easier, if I&#8217;m going to write about them, to write something nasty. I also try not to do it too often, because I wrote three songs about him. I had to stop because it was getting boring for me and for everyone. And you can&#8217;t hang on to shit. </p>
<p><strong>And writing songs is part of getting that stuff out.</strong><br/>
And I mean, I try to do it with a little bit of humour. That line about being on my mind like a tumour &#8211; A tumour&#8217;s not exactly pleasant, but it&#8217;s still a funnier way of saying it than being straight-up angry.</p>
<p><strong>Besides working with [US singer-songwriter] Kelley [Stoltz] and Alex Jarvis, what else are you involved in?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve been playing keyboards in The Breadmakers lately. They&#8217;re rhythm and blues, like The Rolling Stones in the ?60s. I used to work at [the Melbourne label and pressing plant] Corduroy Records, and it&#8217;s my old boss Nick Phillips? band. They just had their 20th birthday. But their organ player moved up to Sydney, so sometimes they have Mikey [Young] from Eddy Current filling in and sometimes me. Lately it&#8217;s been me, as Mikey gets more and more busy. Although I&#8217;m quite busy myself; I think he&#8217;s just better at saying no.</p>
<p><strong>It seems fairly common in Melbourne for everyone to play in each other&#8217;s bands.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Oh, I just remembered: I&#8217;m playing bass in Parading as well, which is with Tom Barry from Witch Hats &#8211; I find I can&#8217;t just be in one band and be satisfied. I need to play Kelley Stoltz-style pop, and the Submarines has been a breath of fresh air. It&#8217;s made me way more interested in The Stabs too. I probably would have strangled someone in The Stabs if I hadn&#8217;t gotten to do this project in the meantime. I think it&#8217;s very healthy. You can&#8217;t stretch yourself too thin, but you can stretch yourself a little. I&#8217;ve been playing [second guitar] with Love Of Diagrams as well lately. I just do what Luke [Horton] tells me to do. That&#8217;s been cool because he plays in a radically different tuning than anything I&#8217;ve ever used. </p>
<p><strong>How do you think the 10? will sound versus the 7??</strong><br/>
Well, songwriting-wise, it&#8217;s probably my most rock. It&#8217;s big and epic. There&#8217;ll be at least five guitars on one particular song, and it&#8217;s too long for a 7?. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a 10?. I love ?em. The other side is probably a bit more mellow than the 7?. And then there&#8217;s a song we&#8217;ve been playing live as a band. I think it all sounds like me. It&#8217;s all coming from the same pen.</p>
<p><strong>How many songs have you written total, including the 7??</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s probably about 15 I&#8217;ve demoed already. There are more half-written or not demoed. There&#8217;s two for the 7?, three for the 10?, and probably about 10 more for the album. Oh, and another one I&#8217;m recording soon for a split 7? with Bleach. He&#8217;s one of my favourite things at the moment. He&#8217;s from Melbourne. I&#8217;m really into him. So we&#8217;re doing a split, and I&#8217;m actually going to have the live band play on that song. </p>
<p><strong>Is there a reason for that?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s just how I think that song will work best. This song is one I didn&#8217;t get to demo. I just showed it to the band. Alex has thrown in some walking bass lines, which I wouldn&#8217;t have done. And Duncan has just nailed the hell out of the drum part. It just sounds right. It would be wrong if I didn&#8217;t do it with the band. </p>
