<h2>Day One</h2>
<p>We arrive in LA early on Friday morning. Things are looking good. Nobody had slept particularly well on the plane, but we&#8217;re all excited. After wrestling with gear and buses for a while we arrive at the stunning Beverly Laurel Motel, our home away from home in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>We usually walk a fine line at the Laurel between being welcomed with open arms and kicked out on the street. But I think we develop an understanding with the proprietors this time around. They turn a blind eye if we hang out down in the garage under the motel, but everywhere else is a bit of a problem because of all the yelling. We enjoy the early bird special from Swingers, the diner that fronts the Laurel. Then we check in and haul the gear up to our rooms. Since we have a show to play in the evening and it wouldn&#8217;t do to be sluggish, we decide to have a restrained nap before heading out.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we head over to Silverlake to meet with Dangerbird, our US record label. We listen through a few tracks from our new album. It&#8217;s great to see everybody again and meet all the new people who have come on board at DB since we were last here. Then we have a photo shoot with Peter Walker, the producer of <em>Granddance</em> and co-founder of Dangerbird. The shoot turns camp, as so many Dappled shoots do. Dave climbs into a wheelbarrow and then somehow gets a hold of a foot-long masonry drill. Amazingly nothing exciting comes of it. Some photos are expertly taken and then the drill is carefully placed back where it was found. Too bad if you were hoping for an early disemboweling.</p>
<p>Down to Spaceland now to play a show with Richard Swift, a talented dude with a great band. We have a fine show too. We&#8217;ve been rehearsing like mad for the last couple of weeks and everything felt good. New songs and sounds emanate from all the right holes. Tim has a shark&#8217;s head on a sparkling blue pedestal which he hits with a stick.</p>
<p>After we finish playing, things get a bit silly. Many pints of cider, a very badly clogged toilet (or well-clogged, depending on your attitude), a small amount of Jamison&#8217;s Irish whiskey, back to the hotel and then out to a friend&#8217;s apartment with some Red Riders. A human pyramid, beautifully formed with a neighbour&#8217;s cat placed at the apex. A huge stacks-on during the walk home. Tom climbing out of a bush on the side of the road and home in bed before sun-up. That&#8217;s a busy day.   </p>
<p/>
<h2>Day Two</h2>
<p>Nothing official to do today, thankfully. We rest up a bit and go down to Melrose to buy some touring clothes. I pick up some slightly effeminate boots and a tie-dye mesh singlet. Alex purchases the best Boston tour T-shirt I&#8217;ve ever seen. Then we head over to the Griffith Observatory in the evening. Alex destroys the earth with a comet simulator. We learn about eclipses. Foucault&#8217;s pendulum swings on. All educational and interesting, but we are restless. We decide to go and get some Mexican food, but our favourite place has an hour-and-a-half wait, so instead we go to a taco place near the hotel that sucks a lot and serves horrible food. Then we pick up some beers from the service station and start drinking in the hotel. Red Riders, who are also staying at the Beverly Laurel have been off playing a show at the Viper Room that evening. They come back around midnight and throw their room keys in the pool. The night manager isn&#8217;t too stoked about it so we all go down to Swingers for a night cap. We do a bit of yelling in Swingers and then decide to go off to bed.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3003762/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="480"/>
<h2>Day Three</h2>
<p>We head up into the Hollywood Hills and then out along Mulholland Drive. We see two men doing a typical LA workout routine. It starts out with some simple stretches at the car, then some deeper stretching at a lookout. Then one of them climbs up into a tree and hangs from a branch while his buddy does some slow-motion Tae Bo. I&#8217;m not sure where they went from there as we had to head down to the Echo in Silverlake for the Aussie BBQ. It&#8217;s a show for all the Aussie acts heading over to Austin for SxSW, and a few others. Red Riders, The Boat People, My Disco, The Drones, Hell City Glamours, and many more. Heaps of fun. All bands are in top form for the trip to SxSW and there&#8217;s a good vibe in the room. Perhaps it&#8217;s just because Holly Valance is there. </p>
<p>We stick around to watch a few bands after us, then decide to have another try at getting a great Mexican dinner. Mexican food takes up a great deal of our time, thought and passion when we&#8217;re on tour, especially in Los Angeles. But as a cuisine, it can be fickle and cruel toward those who crave it. We were scarred by last night&#8217;s taquito abomination and need something special. Fortunately we manage to get a table for about 20 people at El Conquistador and it was good. We sit down to margaritas and mushroom tacos with Red Riders, The Boat People and lots of other people.</p>
<p>Something happens after dinner and we all get separated. Some go to a cougar pick-up joint, others go to a house party in Hollywood. Both these options prove disappointing, and within an hour-and-a-half everybody is back at the hotel and very much &#8220;in the mood&#8221;. We buy some beer and start to drink it. Then the night manager tells us to move to a different room because we are keeping an old lady awake. We go to another room. The manager comes again. Then he comes back to tell us he will let us up on the roof. We last about five minutes up there, then he tells us we have to go because the people below are complaining. We head down and just when it seems like we can&#8217;t win, some people beckon us into their room. Some dudes from a pop band called Midnight Youth. They were super nice. Jess Origlaihlei [sic] from the Veronicas was there. I think they didn&#8217;t realise how many of us or how festive we were when they said we could come and hang. Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t take all that long for us to outstay our welcome. And about half-an-hour after that, we decide maybe we should leave. The night ends with Tim breaking into our manager Troy&#8217;s car down in the garage and having one last Budweiser with Al and Tom.</p>

<h2>Day Four</h2>
<p>A day off and a lovely one for a high-scoring round of golf in Los Feliz. The Pitch ?n? Putt is one of our favourite places in LA. It&#8217;s situated on the banks of the beautiful LA river with extensive hobo views. We stank it up for the first few holes, but then everyone&#8217;s game really picked up around the back four. Allan&#8217;s brother Chris, who flew over from Europe to visit, was the day&#8217;s best. I can&#8217;t remember the exact score but it was something like 25 over. Everybody else was somewhere behind that. Refreshed, we decide to grab some dinner. Then home to watch a Clint Eastwood film about the president. I fall asleep before the end.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Day Five </h2>
<p>Today we get all ready to fly to South By. We check out and get all the gear into the car. Boring. I might just skip to later on &#8230; </p>
<p>We arrive in Texas. We&#8217;re staying a bit out of town, but the hotel is class. Lots of country music memorabilia everywhere. We dump the gear and head into Austin. Most of South By South West is centred around a few blocks of 6th Street, in the heart of Austin. Almost every property along 6th is a bar or music venue, except for a handful of tattooists and a cigar-rolling store. When SxSW starts, there is no escape from bands. You can hear at least two bands blasting at any time, no matter where you are. South By doesn&#8217;t officially start until Thursday, but it&#8217;s St Patrick&#8217;s Day, so the town is full of drunk legends anyway. We check out a few of the local hot spots, and have a Shiner Bock (a Texan beer) in each: Treasure Island, Buffalo Billiards, The Library, then Death Metal Pizza and Best Wurst.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Day Six</h2>
<p>We head straight to the convention centre to register, get our wristbands and generally get official. Then we go over to the Fader Fort, which is a big party that goes on every year. We&#8217;ve been told we&#8217;re going to receive a free pair of Levi&#8217;s. We&#8217;re ushered in and they give us some drinks. Then they bring us a very strange collection of jeans, which we&#8217;re not allowed to exchange. I get some beige chinos, Dave receives flares, Tim makes it his mission to get a replacement pair for his big baggy ones. Alex&#8217;s are a great fit, oddly enough. Allan gives his to his brother. Then we go and do some miscellaneous wandering. We are meant to be DJ-ing at the Australian opening night party tonight, but we don&#8217;t have any CDs or iPods with us. We decide to use all the free sampler CDs we&#8217;ve been given during the day. It&#8217;s pretty fun DJing stuff you&#8217;ve never heard before. Nobody seems to notice, and nobody comes to take over from us either, so after a while we decide to just leave a CD playing and head off.</p>

<h2>Day Seven </h2>
<p>Show day. We have two today. We start out early with a show at 12.30pm. There are a lot of people in the room for so early in the day. Free breakfast burritos and a few beers. A few other Aussie bands playing today, we watch An Horse and Andy Bull. Then we leave the gear at the venue and head over to the Rhapsody party at Mohawks. Glasvegas play and are great. Then Trail of Dead play and are also great. We eat the second most delicious tacos ever, then Tim sees Michael Stipe, although it&#8217;s not actually him, just a bald guy in a shirt. Before we know it, it&#8217;s time to go get the gear, and make our way to show number two, which is our official showcase.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re playing with Eulogies (Pete Walker&#8217;s band) and a whole lot of bands from Bella Union. Eulogies kick butt and then we play a good-feeling set. We later watch a lot of bands (three or so on Bella Union). Tim goes to Emo&#8217;s to see Passion Pit. Everyone else back to Mohawks to catch the end of Akron/Family. Easily the best show we saw at South By, they are mind-blowing and amazing. Psychedelic madness, guitar solos and screaming. Just rad. In the other room, we watch Women from Calgary, Alberta, play to a packed room. Then special guests Dinosaur Jr blast everyone&#8217;s faces off. I&#8217;m pretty pooped after all this and decide to hit the road. We&#8217;ve lost Dave and Tim. Dave ends up in the VIP room at the Playboy party, where he meets some twins and drinks himself half to death. Tim hangs out with The Grates and a dude from Grizzly Bear and drinks himself three quarters to death. I think this is the night that allowed the &#8220;black plague&#8221; to gain a foothold in our touring party.</p>

<h2>Day Eight, March </h2>
<p>Some wake up feeling better than others today. Niggling sore throats, but it&#8217;s hard to separate the illness from the hangovers. So we ignore it. Today we&#8217;re playing at the <em>Onion A.V. Club</em> party. We think we&#8217;re on at 3.15pm, but when someone gets to the venue to check it out, we discover the times have changed and we&#8217;re meant to be onstage in 20 minutes. This is when the famous &#8220;bum incident&#8221; occurs. Because all of 6th Street is blocked off, you generally have to get a cab to the nearest cross street and then walk with all your gear to the venue. Alex and Dave get dropped in a cab at a bus stop a few blocks from the venue. Alex heads to the Radio Room with the first load. On his way back, he meets Dave and a friendly street-person carrying all of my 60kg worth of gear. Alex is all, ?Where&#8217;s the rest of it??, and then Dave&#8217;s all like, ?This guy&#8217;s buddy is watching it.? Alex and the guy&#8217;s bud carry the rest of the gear to the venue. Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s not the first time a hobo has relieved Dave of two big loads. We all manage to get up on stage and set up in time to play an OK show. Phew! Watch a bit of Ra Ra Riot afterwards, have a chat to Trail of Dead out the back, then get all the gear back to the hotel. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a chance that we enjoy a few beers at this point. We definitely go to the Driscoll (a very swanky hotel) and have some margaritas. We go see Cut Off Your Hands at the <em>NME</em> party, talking our way in at the back door by pretending that we were playing later on. Future of the Left are playing too. Aces is a pretty unpleasant venue, apparently they don&#8217;t let bands use their own sound guys there. It&#8217;s the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard. After a while, Alex and I decide to try and get into the Metallica show at Stubb&#8217;s. We come close. Because the Silversun Pickups were supporting them and Brian is Alex&#8217;s new BFF, we thought we&#8217;d be in for sure. I guess they were pretty tight on the guest list though, so we watch from the car park with a whole lot of happy dudes in Metallica shirts. It still sounds pretty amazing from there. They play lots of old songs. Then we go back over to the Radio Room and see a few bands: School of Seven Bells, White Denim and then some crazy British emo kids. In the other room was the Saddle Creek showcase. Saw a bit of Cursive but we didn&#8217;t like it. Were they one of the first emo bands? Or is that a lie somebody made up? They were serving huge cans of Foster&#8217;s there too. Delicious. </p>

<h2>Day Nine</h2>
<p>Oh no. We should have rested. Tim is done for. Sick as a good dog. He manages to climb out of bed to play our last show on the tiniest stage in Austin. It&#8217;s for a Western Australian music event. The only WA band playing is Birds of Tokyo, they cancel and then un-cancel, because their singer was sick and then he got some medicine. Despite all of us feeling pretty shaky, we play a great set. Happy to finish on a high note. We get together for a big Cajun cook-up at the Boiling Pot. I eat what the Americans might call a butt-load of spicy crawdads. Delicious. Tim still wants to exchange those jeans, so we decide to head back to the Fader Fort to see if they&#8217;ll do it. It turns out that Kanye is playing there, and there&#8217;s a queue about 1000 strong. Tim sidles up to the front door to ask if he can come in to buy some jeans. The security guard says no.</p>
<p>Defeated, Tim and Alex head home. I join the others on a trek out to the suburbs to meet up with the Red Riders, who are playing at the Red Bull party in a weird hangar way out of town. No expense spared apparently, the place is incredible. Riders play a great show, then there&#8217;s another band called Shout Out Out Out Out who have two drummers and four bass players and a tonne of technical problems. Then we drink a lot of Red Bull mixed drinks. Erykah Badu, the Crystal Method and Kanye West are all supposed to play, but the city of Austin shuts down the music for some unknown reason. Al from the Riders spends the next hour standing on stage in front of a confused audience, shouting at the organisers to bring the beat back and trying to find dudes who can rap. At one point he nearly got the whole party started again by yelling, &#8220;This is America! Don&#8217;t tell me you can blow up the whole world but you&#8217;re not allowed to party at 4am!&#8221; I think he also shouts something about the Alamo. In the end, the lawyers prevail and the music stays off. So we spend the rest of the night playing Xbox with dudes from various entourages. Apparently Kanye was asleep on the couch behind us too. I didn&#8217;t see him though.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Day 10 </h2>
<p>SxSW is over now, and it has taken its toll. Tim and Dave are both sincerely ill, I&#8217;m on the way there. Allan and Alex are mysteriously fine. There is a theory that the plague is spread by microphone contact. I&#8217;m glad to be out of that hotel room. We couldn&#8217;t open the window and things were getting pretty retro in there. We head to the airport and then back to LA. This time we&#8217;re staying at the Best Western Hollywood Hills, a fine establishment above a famous diner called the 101. Tim runs into The Presets in the lobby, they&#8217;re about to start their US tour. Then everybody just flops about. <em>The Fifth Element</em> is on TV and we watch it. We go and have some soup at the diner.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Day 11</h2>
<p>Have an inspiring meeting with Dangerbird about the upcoming record. Everyone&#8217;s pumped about it. On this day we ate delicious burritos at Delta Taco. Also have a road-rage run-in with a big jerk while trying to buy a hat. He has shit hair and is wearing a T-shirt that says &#8220;God&#8217;s busy&#8221; and something about the devil. I buy two sparkly gold jackets. Then we go to In-N-Out Burger, and Allan goes all the way with a double double animal style. Watch <em>10000 BC* on the TV. Eat at the 101. Watch the *Time Machine</em> starring Guy Pierce. </p>
<p/>
<h2>Day 12</h2>
<p>On this day we go downtown to Olivera Street, the oldest street in LA. Alex and I eat the best damn tacos we&#8217;ve ever had. Ever. Then we head up Beachwood Canyon to the original Hollywood, which is like a weird medieval theme park, but with rich people living in it. We go up into the hills and go for a walk on a trail. Delightful. </p>
<p>The end.</p>

<p>Dappled Cities will perform at Essential Festival at Sydney&#8217;s Oxford Art Factory on April 25.</p>
