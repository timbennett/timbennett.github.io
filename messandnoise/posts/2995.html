                <h3>They were obviously thinking about Clare Moore when they come up with the phrase, ?Behind every great man there&#8217;s a great woman.? As drummer for The Moodists, The Coral Snakes and The Lurid Yellow Mist, Moore has literally been ?behind? her showman partner Dave Graney for 25 years. But in this interview with TREVOR BLOCK conducted in late 2008, the focus is squarely on her.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002470/440x561-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
By her own estimates, Clare Moore has played over 2500 live shows in a career spanning nearly 25 years. As drummer for The Moodists, she was a vital part of the momentum behind releases like <em>Engine Shudder* and *Thirsty&#8217;s Calling</em>; defining moments for Australian music.</p>
<p>In collaboration with long-time partner Dave Graney she has worked on everything from ARIA-winning albums to live cabaret and movie soundtracks. The Moodists have been fairly well documented elsewhere, so this interview is about her. And, as she explained from her home and studio, ?The Ponderosa? in the Dandenong Ranges, both she and Graney like to keep busy.?</p>
<p><strong>Your Wikipedia entry mentions that one of your first musical experiences was playing with Sister Janet Mead, the ?Singing Nun?.</strong><br/>
I thought everyone knew the story behind that. Yes, Sister Janet Mead was a teacher at the school I went to as a kid in Adelaide. When she released her version of ?The Lord&#8217;s Prayer? things went a little bit mad. This nun from Adelaide had this massive worldwide hit, you know. We had camera crews and stuff all over the school for ages. </p>
<p>Anyway, she brought kids in to teach them rock&#8217;n?roll, which was quite strange really. But then it was a strange time. <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> had come out around then too, and there was this whole thing about religion being kind of  hippy-ish, all groovy and cool. And nuns had just been allowed a lot more freedom then. They didn&#8217;t have to shave their heads under their habits anymore, for instance, and I think that in some ways they just went for it, and tried to be as groovy as nuns can be. </p>
<p>I was just lucky that I was learning to play and so I got to learn from her and play with her. We used to do a rock mass at the cathedral in central Adelaide every Sunday to crowds of 1000 or so people at a time when I was about 13 or 14 years old. And we recorded too. She was hugely successful. I went to the gold record presentation, which was held at the Hilton with all the Festival Records bigwigs. I still have the invite somewhere. But apart from that, I didn&#8217;t learn anything at school really.</p>
<p><strong>How did you go from playing in a cathedral to playing the devil&#8217;s music?</strong><br/>
Well, we were an all-girl school, but Sister Janet had brought other people in to be in the band, by which I mean she brought in boys. And we talked to them and so on. One of these boys asked me to play in another band called Precious Memories with him. They are a bit of a legend in Adelaide, and I think they&#8217;re still going actually. We used have these kind of jam sessions, art happenings or whatever you want to call them, with drama and poetry and stuff going on as well as music. </p>
<p>The live music scene was quite small back then and it wasn&#8217;t yet under the control of alcohol industry. So bands would hire a local hall or venue themselves and you could do what you liked at those things.<br/>
It was not long after this time that pub rock took over, of course. But the musicians were in control before then and they booked their own shows at their own places a lot of the time. Although having said that, in the early days of venues like the Crystal Ballroom, you could congregate and socialise with people as well as watch the music. And often all the bands on a particular night were different too &#8211; you&#8217;d get a punky band, a mod band and who knows what other weird shit.</p>
<p>Now everything seems to be divided, people don&#8217;t mix as much, they stay in their little scenes. And a lot of people want to just show up, watch the band and go. Some of them don&#8217;t seem to be able to concentrate for more than half-an-hour, so they can&#8217;t get through a whole set or a whole night and they just drift off and go home when they get bored. I&#8217;ve also noticed people don&#8217;t watch the support bands much either. As the drummer, I always have to get to shows early and lug all my gear in, so I always get to see the supports when we play, which I like.</p>
<blockquote><p>?You&#8217;ve gotta keep moving in this business and keep a few balls in the air all the time. It&#8217;s easy enough to find time if you never ever cook or do any housework. That&#8217;s my advice.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Was being a woman in rock ever an issue for you?</strong><br/>
Well you have to remember that in the early ?80s, there were tons of women playing and it just wasn&#8217;t such a big deal. I&#8217;m sad that most didn&#8217;t carry on playing, which is a shame, though there a few still involved from back then like Cathy Green and Lindy Morrison. But I avoid that whole ?women in rock? label myself. It&#8217;s great to see and I&#8217;d like to see more of them, but it&#8217;s up to the person. And it seems to me that there are many bands that have women in them now, and it&#8217;s good to see so many playing again. When the Moodists moved to England, a lot of people there thought it was weird, especially for a woman to be an instrumentalist like a drummer, and to actually be in the band, not up the front singing. There are lots of great female jazz musos though.</p>
<p><strong>What have you got on the go right now?</strong><br/>
Well, a few things as usual. I&#8217;m doing an album with Kaye Louise Patterson from Acuff Rose. We are doing half the album each, and will be playing some live shows next year [2009]. Dave and I are working on a new Lurid Yellow Mist album, as well as playing a few gigs here and there. Dave is doing a follow-up to the <em>Point Blank* cabaret show as well, for next year, but that doesn&#8217;t even have a name yet. I&#8217;m making an album with Jane Dust, some of which we may do at home at Ponderosa. Then there&#8217;s live dates to come with Crystal Thomas and the Flowers of Evil and some Salmon shows are in the works too. I might be playing drums in a strange Carpenters tribute show thing too, but I&#8217;m not sure about that yet. (*Laughs</em>) So that&#8217;s what, seven projects underway? You&#8217;ve gotta keep moving in this business and keep a few balls in the air all the time. It&#8217;s easy enough to find time if you never ever cook or do any housework. That&#8217;s my advice.</p>

<strong>What&#8217;s it like having your own studio at home?</strong><br/>
Oh, it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s not huge, but we have Pro Tools set up and can do quite a lot there. It&#8217;s mostly for things Dave and I and or our friends are doing really. Darling Downs recorded an album there, The Sand Pebbles did a few things. It&#8217;s not really big enough for a huge group but it&#8217;s a good setup for small bands or acoustic bands. Sometimes we might actually record in another studio but then come back home to finish it off.</p>
<p><strong>How do you and Dave go when it comes to working together?</strong><br/>
We tend to work separately a lot, actually. If we&#8217;ve done a song together it usually means that I would have written all the music and cooked it up into a song, and then he has come along later and done the lyrics. Working together that way, doing a part each, seems to work well for us. The <em>Bad Eggs</em> soundtrack we did separately from each other, doing half of it each, and that came out well too. I guess it&#8217;s just like any other musical partnership, really. The married side is kept kind of separate from the working side. But then most bands are together a lot, you know? Probably almost the amount of time as we&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s a typical day like for you?</strong><br/>
Well, obviously we get up at dawn and work out in the home gym for a few hours in the morning, before jogging down to the village to get bread and newspapers, before we go into the studio. Well, that&#8217;s partly true. We are in the studio most days. There&#8217;s also a lot of work involved in organising live gigs and projects for the various bands and so on, because of course we manage ourselves. We also like to go out a lot to see other bands, especially new bands. A lot of people stop going to live shows after a while, maybe because they have kids, or whatever, but we feel we have to keep up with what&#8217;s new and local. And we like to check out new venues too. </p>
<p>Last week [November 26, 2008] we went to the Barrage album launch at the Toff In Town and he was excellent, as were Panel of Judges who supported. Just superb. Because Dave is doing a show on Triple R at the moment, he gets sent a lot of CDs that we listen to, which is how we found another new favourite: Leisure Class. We are always on the lookout for new things.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
