                <h3>Pub closures, protests, tragic deaths and a little band called Circle Pit &#8211; we look back on an eventful first half of 2010. Tomorrow, the last six months of the year.
</h3>
<h2>January</h2>

<strong>St Kilda Farewells Favourite Son Howard:</strong> Five-hundred mourners pay tribute to Rowland S Howard at his funeral at the Sacred Heart Mission in St Kilda, just up the street from where he played his <a href="/events/2001915">last ever gig</a>. Howard is eulogised by long-time friend and partner Genevieve McGuckin, brother and bandmate Harry Howard, filmmaker Paul Goldman and collaborator Mick Harvey. In the weeks following his death, <em>M+N</em>?s Trevor Block approaches many of his friends and former bandmates for <a href="/articles/3853723">written tributes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pyramid&#8217;s Stormy Weather:</strong> A severe electrical storm <a href="/news/3836958">forces the closure</a> of the main stage at the Pyramid Rock Festival in Phillip Island, Victoria, on New Year&#8217;s Eve. Empire Of The Sun, Grinspoon, The Butterfly Effect and Van She stay in their caravans, and people totally lose their shit over the lack of a countdown. Organisers respond with, <a href="/news/3837395">?It could&#8217;ve been worse.?</a></p>
<p><strong>All Bets Off At The Tote:</strong> Proprietor Bruce Milne issues a press release <a href="/news/3845158">announcing</a> the sudden closure of iconic Melbourne venue The Tote. In an <a href="/articles/3847100">interview</a> with <em>M+N</em>, Milne blames ?high risk? licensing conditions, including increased fees and security requirements. More than 1000 people stage an <a href="/news/3849119">impromptu protest</a>, and the pub closes with a <a href="/articles/3850129">final flurry</a> of bands on January 18 including an unforgettable performance of GOD&#8217;s ?My Pal? by Joel Silbersher and The Drones.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3017280/640x380-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>From Arthouse To Outhouse:</strong> Still reeling from the closure of The Tote, news breaks that The Arthouse, which has hosted punk and indie shows in North Melbourne for the past 19 years, would be <a href="/news/3850779">closing its doors</a> in May 2011. Speaking to <em>M+N</em>, management blames<br/>
liquor licensing regulations and a dispute with the landlord.</p>
<p><strong>Perth&#8217;s Hydey Goes Quietly Into The Night:</strong> Not to be outdone by events on the east coast, Perth&#8217;s Hyde Park Hotel stops hosting gigs following a large-scale renovation. There are <a href="/news/3855016">fears</a> that when the front bar eventually re-opens, live music will not be a feature.</p>
<p><strong>Laneway On The Move:</strong> Following 2009?s year to forget, the St Jerome&#8217;s Laneway Festival successfully shifts to <a href="/articles/3860894">Footscray</a> in Melbourne and <a href="/articles/3862233">Rozelle</a> in Sydney. UK headliners Echo &amp; The Bunnymen do their best to throw a spanner in the works by <a href="/news/3856066">missing a flight</a>, but they&#8217;re replaced by The Dirty Three in Brisbane and The Midnight Juggernauts in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Splitting Up:</strong> After two albums, three EPs and more than 260 shows in 13 countries, Brisbane&#8217;s I Heart Hiroshima announce they&#8217;re <a href="/news/3842158">taking a break</a>; Melbourne experimental rock trio Grey Daturas <a href="/articles/3841963">call it quits</a> after nine years; and short-lived quartet The Diamond Sea play their <a href="/news/3852191">final two shows</a> in Sydney.</p>
<h2>February</h2>

<strong>Melbourne&#8217;s SLAM Dunk:</strong> A reported 20,000 people <a href="/articles/3882468">march</a> from the State Library of Victoria to Parliament House in protest of Melbourne&#8217;s liquor licensing regime. An <a href="/news/3881352">accord</a> is signed on the eve of the rally, which promises to find a solution to the problem within six months.</p>
<p><strong>Greed At Work In ?Kookaburra? Case:</strong> The Federal Court rules that Men At Work&#8217;s 1982 hit ?Down Under? reproduced a substantial part of folk standard ?Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree?. Songwriter Colin Hay describes the claim as <a href="/news/3867156">?opportunistic greed?</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We Need A New Proxy!:</strong> Following the closure of The Tote, the Victorian Government meets with representatives from Melbourne&#8217;s live music scene to try and nip the ?live music and alcohol-related violence? issue in the bud. Despite some <a href="/news/3871349">?quiet optimism?</a>, little is resolved. Occasional <em>M+N</em> columnist and participant Dave Graney <a href="/articles/3871403">takes minutes</a> for us.</p>
<p><strong>Comeback Kings:</strong> Melbourne&#8217;s The Paradise Motel return after a 10-year hiatus with concept album <em>Australian Ghost Story*; while Sydney&#8217;s Crow <a href="/news/3877633">announce</a> details of a new album, *Arcane*, their first since 1993?s Steve Albini-produced *My Kind of Pain</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Melbourne&#8217;s Birmy &#8211; Too Darn Loud?:</strong> The thorny issue of first amenity rights resurfaces after The Birmingham Hotel is <a href="/news/3877115">rocked</a> by noise complaints from a neighbouring property. An online petition circulates casting doubt on the future of gigs at the pub. Owners decide to <a href="/news/3886559">renovate</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lunchbox Launches:</strong> <em>M+N</em> launches its <a href="/tv/lunchbox">Lunchbox gig series</a> at 1000 &#8211; Bend in Melbourne&#8217;s CBD with a free performance by Denim Owl.</p>

<p><strong>In Memoriam:</strong> Acclaimed singer, songwriter and Black Arm Band instigator Ruby Hunter <a href="/news/3878252">dies suddenly</a> at her home in southwest Victoria, aged 54.</p>
<p><strong>Splitting Up:</strong> Sydney&#8217;s Ghosts of Television meet an ?organic end? (obituary <a href="/articles/3881476">here</a>); and Melbourne outfit Deloris <a href="/news/3874758">call it a day</a> after 11 years and four albums of ?varying degrees of worth?.</p>

<strong>The AMP Takes Gender Bias Seriously:</strong> Lisa Mitchell wins the $30,000 Australian Music Prize, prompting claims she won by <a href="http://www.pedestrian.tv/music/features/conspiracy-theory-how-lisa-mitchell-won-the-austra/10893.htm">?by default?</a> and because of an article bemoaning the lack of female nominees. Patron and sometime <em>M+N</em> writer Chris Johnston issues a <a href="/articles/3902643">riposte</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Weekend Lives Up To Its Name:</strong> After shifting venues and <a href="/news/3867687">losing a day</a>, Brisbane&#8217;s inaugural Lost Weekend festival eventually <a href="/news/3886294">succumbs</a> to poor tickets sales. It&#8217;s a surprising development given the strength of the line-up (Dinosaur Jr, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Drones).</p>
<p><strong>Philly Jays Decamp To London:</strong> After inking a deal with Too Pure, Philadelphia Grand Jury follow in the footsteps of The Temper Trap, Snowman and pretty much every other Australian band with ambition when they <a href="/news/3888090">announce</a> their relocation to the UK. Singer Berkfinger later laments the decision in an <a href="/articles/4113264">interview</a>, describing Britain as ?broken?.</p>
<p><strong>Brisbane Says ?No? To Lockout:</strong> OK, so it was no SLAM Rally, but 600 Brisbane music lovers <a href="/articles/3895450">gather outside</a> Queensland Parliament House to protest a proposed 12am lockout. Organisers claim the reduced trading hours would have significant financial implications for venues and tarnish Brisbane&#8217;s reputation as destination for touring bands.</p>

<p><strong>In Memoriam:</strong> The music community mourns the death of HTRK bassist Sean Stewart, who took his own life at the age of 29. In a <a href="/news/3915856">statement</a> issued to <em>M+N</em>, band members Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang pay tribute to his ?strange and beautiful? character. Uncompromisingly unique Melbourne songwriter Pip Proud dies after a long battle with throat cancer. Dave Nichols <a href="/articles/3900077">pays tribute</a></p>
<p><strong>Splitting Up:</strong> St Helens <a href="/news/3896651">call time</a> on their one-album career after frontman Jarrod Quarrell decides to devote his energies to solo project Lost Animal. In an <a href="/news/3907685">interview</a> with <em>M+N</em> he says the decision wasn&#8217;t made lightly: ?It was a gut feeling that wouldn&#8217;t go away.?</p>
