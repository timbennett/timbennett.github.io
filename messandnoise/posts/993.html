                <h3><strong>RAPH BROUS</strong> offers a well-mannered (mostly) account of his infamous band recording their debut LP at Birdland Studios with Jim Sclavunos (The Bad Seeds, Grinderman).
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3035234/420x320-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Usually, I hate recording sessions. Playing gigs is fun (except at dance festivals where kids in singlets want you to be The Wombats). Recording sessions are often tedious ordeals of setting up drums and microphones, of endless coffee breaks, of fixing buggered vocals, of syncing drum tracks, of sitting indoors fiddling with guitar leads when we&#8217;d rather go skateboarding and eat concrete.</p>
<p>This session was the rare enjoyable studio experience. The producer was Jim Sclavunos. Nowadays Jim plays drums in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Grinderman and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=2q1VSl7cFxo">Silver Alert</a>. He also played in seminal bands like Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks, Sonic Youth and The Cramps. I heard Jim&#8217;s production through his albums with The Horrors and Jim Jones Revue. Then, during Grinderman&#8217;s last Oz tour, I met Jim at a bar and we spent a long time arguing about Republican politics.</p>
<p>We made the album at <a href="http://www.birdlandstudios.com.au">Birdland Studios</a> in Melbourne. That&#8217;s where Rowland S. Howard made his classic solo records. When I first saw Rowland in person, he was playing tiny free gigs at North Melbourne&#8217;s Town Hall Hotel. Now Rowland&#8217;s life story is played on national TV and the Qantas movie channel. During our sessions, I occasionally imagined Rowland in the Birdland tracking room. When I envisaged him recording the guitar parts to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=Nh8npSl1Luc">?Dead Radio?</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ckymeO6qWcQ">?Sleep Alone?</a>, the bar was set impossibly high.</p>

<p/>
<h2>The First Night</h2>
<p>Meeting Jim at the hotel, I was again impressed by his height and Ned Kelly beard. That facial hair (now departed) was the real thing, unlike the post-adolescent bumfluff worn by 75% of twenty-something males in Northcote/Surry Hills. On route to the studio, we bumped into a clean-shaven Martyn P. Casey (of Bad Seeds/Triffids fame). Jim and I agreed that Martyn bears a striking resemblance to Tina Weymouth from Talking Heads.</p>
<p>At Birdland, Jim met the resident producer, Lindsay Gravina. Lindsay took us to a nearby bar called Borsch, Vodka and Tears. Lindsay and Jim drank obscure vodkas and spoke tech talk, while I sat next to a drunk lady who wore a lot of jewellery. For 90 torturous minutes, she told me about her brilliance at photography, painting, writing, sculpture and Asian embroidery. I compared her conversation to mouldy cheese and she punched me in the head. She was wearing a big ring and it really hurt. Her buddy (the ex-drummer from Neil Wedd&#8217;s favourite glam band <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/05/1057179203092.html">Streetkid Vandal</a>) told the management to kick me out.</p>
<p>Then the fashionably hairy bar manager announced to the patrons that until I left, no drinks would be served. I remained on my bum and a stupid argument ensued. Jim and Lindsay decided that it was bedtime. We all went home and I put frozen peas on my forehead.</p>

<p/>
<h2>A Week of Recording</h2>
<p>After 30 years of making great albums, Jim knows what he wants. Sometimes illustrious musicians pretend to produce albums without knowing a damn thing about recording gear, but Jim&#8217;s the real deal. He spent hours examining outboard equipment, frequency levels, vocal filters, etc.</p>
<p>It was the first time that our [then] bass player Jackson [Kay], a 20-year-old beanpole from Bacchus Marsh, had recorded in a legit studio. It was the first time that our lead singer, James ?JK? Kennedy, had seen a studio. JK&#8217;s principle interests are skateboarding, economic theory and various means of inebriation. Although he left school early, JK educates himself. In the studio, he read two entire acts of federal legislation, including the Imperials Act of 1884.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3035233/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We recorded 12 hours a day, racing to beat Jim&#8217;s flight to London.</p>
<h2>The Sixth Day</h2>
<p>Jack Mannix flew down from Sydney. The XY half of <a href="/articles/3917459">Circle Pit</a>, Jack&#8217;s the musical cross between Jean Genet and the antihero from a ?70s biker movie. Jack and JK got appropriately baked and sang <a href="/news/4463267">a duet</a>.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3035231/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The next day, Jim escaped overseas. We started rehearsing for a tour opening for M83, but then suddenly <a href="/news/4424300">got kicked off the tour</a> because JK inhaled a few nangs and shared them with punters in the front row. Anthony Gonzalez, a talented yet vicious Gallic dwarf, demands a atmosphere of adoration not unlike the cult leader David Koresh amid his doomed, brainwashed concubines at Waco. </p>
<h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
<p>A month later, Jim Sclavunos returned to Australia for his <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=5aLjbgRriP8">Faustian Pact</a></em> performance at the Perth International Festival. Then he spent five days mixing our album at Birdland. Mixing is a slow process, torturous for the undiluted narcissism of hearing your own vocals played for days straight.</p>
<p>JK arrived for the final three hours of mixing, celebrating the release of his signature skate deck and a court victory for the Occupy Movement. Finally, 11 songs were done.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3035232/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>To celebrate, we took Jim to one of the few Melbourne bars open at 3am on a Monday night (Revolver), but the goateed bartender wouldn&#8217;t accept the out-of-date drink cards we found under a cushion at the studio. JK did a backflip off a couch and a security gorilla told us to leave the premises. Beneath the fading streetlights, I gave Jim Sclavunos a hug goodbye, feeling the prickly bush of his Chassidic bushranger&#8217;s beard.</p>
