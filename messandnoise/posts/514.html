                <h3>As Australia&#8217;s creative community prepares to descend on Newcastle for Sound Summit &#8211; the music component of the This Is Not Art (TINA) festival &#8211; co-director <strong>CHRIS HEARN</strong> (aka Alps) gives us his picks for the three-day event.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014730/440x550-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>How and why did you get involved in Sound Summit?</strong><br/>
Sound Summit has two-year terms for co-directors, and I jumped in at the beginning of this year. It seemed like a good fit and the right time, and I&#8217;m very glad to be doing it now that the festival is just about to begin. It was a standard application process; I applied after a previous director had finished their term. We are sadly about to lose Andrew Tuttle after this festival, and are looking for another co-director to start soon. I&#8217;d encourage anyone who is interested in getting involved next year to come along to the festival and check out as much as they can.</p>
<p><strong>What were your impressions of last year&#8217;s event?</strong><br/>
Last year&#8217;s Sound Summit featured a New Weird Australia showcase event across a few different venues. I played alongside a lot of my favourite Australian bands such as Castings, Holy Balm, Polyfox and Moonmilk. It was also wonderful to see Pumice from New Zealand and Bum Creek from Melbourne at the showcase gigs. As usual, I didn&#8217;t get to see everything I wanted to and ended up with really sore legs.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3014731/400x290-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>As someone who&#8217;s lived in Newcastle for almost a decade, what does Sound Summit bring to the city?</strong><br/>
In a way, it reminds people that Newcastle exists. This year we&#8217;ve put a greater focus on Novocastrian content than in previous years, so out-of-towners will have a chance to see Polyfox, Bare Grillz (pictured, left), Cock Safari and Avant Hard at official gigs; many Newcastle panelists; and a Newcastle-centric panel discussing the micro-scenes operating within this city, and how they can be used as a model to investigate patterns within the cultures of other towns. Sound Summit, of course, also brings to Newcastle a ton of fresh faces and bands, not just for the festival gigs, but for many unofficial side shows and squat gigs. My first ever Alps show was during the festival in an abandoned print shop with some other weird kids from Brisbane and Sydney. It felt like the right time to bring it out.</p>
<p><strong>Are the gigs being held at any unique venues/spaces?</strong><br/>
As in previous years, a bunch of unused spaces around Newcastle get done up for a few days to hold TINA events. This year the official Festival Club is in an unused pool hall on King Street which was called &#8220;Strokers&#8221;. Most of our Sound Summit panels are held in a hall called TPI House, which stands for &#8220;Totally and Permanently Incapacitated&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have a hand in selecting the performers or speakers?</strong><br/>
We have both an application process, in which people propose panel and event ideas to us, as well as our own curated events. Sound Summit is run by three co-directors: myself, Andrew Tuttle and Kirsty Brown. The events are a mixture of compromises, and individual babies. You can tell by checking out who is facilitating panels &#8211; for a fair few, the person chairing it gave birth to that particular panel.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about Soundclash.</strong><br/>
Soundclash is an initiative of Australia Council for the Arts. Since 2009 it has funded artists who were considered to be &#8220;risk takers&#8221; in the contemporary music world, basically bands who use traditional pop and rock music formats, but also have a strong focus on experimentation. This year it was awarded to acts such as ky?, Holy Balm and Collarbones, who are all performing at the Soundclash showcase at Sound Summit (Sunday, October 3, at the TINA Festival Club, from 7pm).</p>
<blockquote><p>?You could almost summarise the purpose of Sound Summit as simply: to encourage innovation and combat mediocrity.?</p></blockquote>
<p>**How does the discussion component of Sound Summit differ from other<br/>
industry talkfests of late?**<br/>
All of Sound Summit&#8217;s panels are free, which is a pretty obvious point of difference. Also, we aim to keep our focus on the independent and innovative. We are more interested in: labels with aesthetic rather than economic focuses, or operating under new and risky business models than getting the major label reps you&#8217;d see at other conferences; artists with real stories to tell rather than stories of coke, champagne and caviar; and discussions of criticism rather than marketing strategies. Our panels are for people with souls.</p>
<p><strong>In that respect, what are some of your panel picks?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m speaking &#8211; along with Jason Campbell from University of Newcastle, Songs? Jeff Burch, Nick Senger from Vox Cyclops and Nic Warnock from R.I.P Society &#8211; on a panel called, ?Reinventing the Obsolete: Music as a Cultural Artefact? (Saturday, October 2, 12pm-1.30pm at TPI Auditorium). This panel will approach the somewhat generic topic of digital technology and its impact, but unlike previous years, it will approach the discussion with a focus on the passion of the record collector over the financial drive of the music industry. There&#8217;s also a workshop on Sunday (1pm-5pm, Hunter TAFE Worksheds), where Christian Moraga from Cubisteffects will teach participants how to build solder and wire their very own fuzz pedal from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>And the shows?</strong><br/>
The Friday and Saturday night showcases at the Cambridge Hotel are going to be killers. I&#8217;m really looking forward to Scattered Order on Friday night and Blank Realm on Saturday night. Saturday is also Jeff and Steve [Uren&#8217;s] last show with Songs, so it will be sad to see them go, but a great way to see them off. I&#8217;m also stoked to see some of Newcastle&#8217;s best on these bills: Cock Safari on Friday and Bare Grillz on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>In his <a href="/articles/3775447">report</a> on last year&#8217;s event, Jon Tjhia had this to say about the event: &#8220;As a creative community, we need to keep reassessing our approaches, priorities and aspirations, and this is the dialogue to which Sound Summit makes a crucial contribution&#8221;. Do you think that still rings true?</strong><br/>
Absolutely. You could almost summarise the purpose of Sound Summit as simply: to encourage innovation and combat mediocrity. This year&#8217;s festival also has panels focusing on crucial issues such as sustainability in music, the role of the physical object in contemporary music releases, the role of the critic, the relevance of the music prize, and the way that music communities work and interact among themselves on local, national and international levels. In 2010, things are a lot different than they were when our parents first picked up guitars. Whether this is a good thing or not is up to the individual to decide, but if they don&#8217;t consider it at all, they&#8217;re fucking kidding themselves.</p>
