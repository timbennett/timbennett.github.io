<h2>&#8216;Dear Joseph&#8217;</h2>
<p>All the best songs are written as the result of commercial transactions. Think of Gerry Goffin and Carol King banging out &#8216;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&#8217; punched-in and on the clock in a piano shoebox at the Brill Building on Broadway. Tin Pan Alley, Music Row, Denmark Street. That&#8217;s where the magic happens. I have read somewhere Brian Wilson once placed an ad in a newspaper for lyrics. John Lennon tried to track down Phil Spector to work on an album that way.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was only logical to engage their services in the dark arts of song craft.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the throbbing heart of &#8216;Dear Joseph&#8217; beats to the rhythm of the market place. But we&#8217;re not talking pineapples and bananas here, we&#8217;re talking <em>barter</em>. My brother&#8217;s girlfriend is the co-operator, creative director, and CEO of a novel startup E-enterprise called Clothing For Correspondence. It&#8217;s real, look it up using your favourite proprietary internet search engine. The deal is they write in return for items of clothing. Let&#8217;s say you need a letter explaining to your boyfriend why you pashed his bestie at his birthday party, or you need to get out of a parking fine, or you need to fill out a really nasty piece of bureaucratic paperwork, like a grant application, or a list of lighting sound and lighting requirements for a Japanese gig to ten people at a Live House in suburban Kobe, Clothing For Correspondence is where you turn.</p>
<p>It was only logical to engage their services in the dark arts of song craft. I had the clothes. Why bust a gut slaving over a lyric when you can clear out a little wardrobe space AND get your hit-making done at the same time? Penelope Chai provided a highly professional and timely service in providing the lyrics to &#8216;Dear Joseph&#8217;. It deals with the dark and socially biting experience of riding next to a bit of a dickhead on a Tiger to Sydney. Try singing it next time you&#8217;re on your favourite bogan airline.</p>
<p>You may say I bent the rules and lent on the familial loyalties when I lodged a blue polka dot scarf in return for lyrics sheet. I would say that it could have been a hanky.</p>
<p>I remember writing the chords and melody to this one sitting in bed late at night with a guitar. I once had a music teacher that said, &#8220;if you get a run on, resist the urge to put your pen down after a few bars and reward yourself with a tub of hummus, BBQ shapes and an episode of a HBO show.&#8221; So I remember pushing this song out in one of those violent birth givings or orgasms of creativity and broke on through to three in the morning. </p>
<p>Later, I took this little Frankenstein baby to the radical, ambidextrous and vocal on many levels Evelyn Ida Morris of Pikelet fame to topline the fuck out of this one. We recorded it in her bedroom. I know, in a bedroom? Crazy huh?</p>

<h2>&#8216;Young Lover&#8217;</h2>
<p>Now I need to be a little careful with this one because it&#8217;s kinda about a certain high profile power couple from within the Melbourne rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll scene and one&#8217;s a bit older and one&#8217;s a bit younger and they&#8217;re both pretty successful but let&#8217;s say one them is taking off and one of them is in the dark at the back of the venue by the merch desk and watching the other one do their thing and contemplating the ephemerality of existence and the fickleness of fortune and wondering where they go from here. </p>
<p>How could any self-respecting songwriter resist a gimme like that?</p>
<p>Sez Wilks was the diva for this one and not only can she sing like a boss but she is pretty handy with the old song craft so we polished this one up in the backyard of the residential wing in the hallowed grounds of Sunshine Studio 1, beneath the Hills Hoist with a lean to it and the beside the Bunnings hammock already on it&#8217;s way to early decommission due to excessive guano exposure. The neighbour at the time was a keen Steiner-inspired home schooling gardener who was rarely out of a 5 metre radius from the vegie patch and chook run. She later told me she had enjoyed our songwriting session from beyond the kale. Sharing gossip across the fence is a cliche but salacious songsmithery is a whole other level of community engagement. And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say on the matter </p>

</p>
<h2>&#8216;I&#8217;m Gonna Get Dressed Up&#8217;</h2>
<p>Clare St. Clare is the best dressed woman in Melbourne show business. If clothes maketh the man then style makes the singer. So she was the obvious choice for this ultimate ode to the power-dress. Our protagonist in this one is giving her lover one last chance to notice her godess-ness as a last ditch ultimatum before she steps out for a blinder. These boots are made for walkin&#8217; style. Perhaps a little more proactive, though just as angry.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/108460685&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"/></iframe><br/>
</p>
<h2>&#8216;Once A Year&#8217;</h2>
<p>Well this one really is meant as a classic Sinatra/Piaf/Bing kinda deal. Arpegiated accompaniment and diminished chords. But it all got sidetracked. Once you put the Koto and the synth lines down, you&#8217;re in uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Prudence Rees Lee, whose band I was playing cello in for a while, does the breathy Brigitte Bardot for the track. More Beth Gibbons than Barbra Streisand, which brought a whole new dimension to the track. At one point we constructed a multitrack choir of her vocals that sounds like kids singing offstage like operatic ghosts from the wings.</p>
<p>Subject matter wise, we&#8217;re talking families, broken families, international relations and extra marital activities. Age old issues, modern day common occurrences&#8230;</p>

</p>
<h2>&#8216;Sweet Fantasy&#8217;</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll need to be a little cagey about this one too as the t:dy t:wns legal team are currently in the process of pursuing proceedings for retrospective breach of copyright with a number of so-called &#8220;artists&#8221; including Mariah Carey and her songwriting team for their track &#8216;Fantasy&#8217; and Bobby Darrin for &#8216;Dream Lover&#8217; as well as Australian&#8217;s own Divinyls for &#8216;I Touch Myself&#8217; and Cole Porter for &#8216;I Concentrate On You&#8217;. See also Paul Kelly&#8217;s section on masturbation songs in his <em>How To Make Gravy A-Z</em> book.</p>
<p>This one has NZ artist Hula Hope bringing the fun vibes. I met Hula Hope through Melbourne music label Empressario and all round scenester Dan Lewis. She had a few days spare, I had a room with microphones in it and one thing led to another.</p>
<p>There is a video clip for this one where a discarded mattress from the side of a Western suburban cricket club was nabbed and had holes cut into it so that the entire t:dy t:wns extended family could lay under the musty mass ad nauseaum while we poked our arms through to grope the aforementioned hapless kiwi. Was it worth the 600 views? Eminently debatable. </p>

<h2>&#8216;Bare Chested Boys&#8217;</h2>
<p>Have you ever been stuck at the traffic lights watching a bunch of young punks fanging it on their treddlies? Across the train tracks, their shirts stuffed in their pockets, swearing, acting tough, doing tricks. Only stopping here and there for the scrawling of uninspired tag names on bland blue grey walls with nothing more sophisticated then jumbo permanent markers like dogs weeing on territory. Wanker&#8217;s right? But you would have to admit the existence of a certain verve and vigour, brashness and boldness of an undeniable measure of muck up machismo.</p>
<p>Now imagine you&#8217;re a woman on her way to work, not getting any younger, somewhat sexually repressed, frustrated, distant, jaded against her own will. Wouldn&#8217;t there be a certain part of you that admired their bull shit bravado? Would it be possible that that admiration would be tinged with something more primal, more base, more rooted in the body?</p>
<p>In some ways this is throw away bubble gum pop. But, hopefully, like all great acts of deep, dumb pop ingenuity it holds enough of the melancholy and the wistfulness to win through.</p>
<p>This one features the at once innocently vulnerable and worldly stylish Elizabeth Michell of the recently relentlessly rising Totally Mild. I feel a bit bad because this was originally just going to be a demo that got sent off to you know like Beyonce of Rihanna or something. But Liz nailed it so hard she dobbed herself in for the gig so really she&#8217;s got no-one to blame but herself. And Beyonce and Rihanna for being busy.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Let Go&#8217;</h2>
<p>People say that minor keys are sad, major keys are happy in music. I think the reality is actually more complex but if you were to put musical attributes together by rule of thumb like this I like my friend Evan Meagher&#8217;s comment that 3 against 4 rhythms represent the mystery of the universe. If you have never spent the time learning how to tap 3 rhythm with one hand and a 4 on the other I highly recommend you put aside a few minutes, while you&#8217;re at the bus stop or waiting for your computer to un-shit itself, every day or two over the next couple of weeks to nut it out. Google it. It&#8217;s a real mind boggler. It&#8217;s the alpha and the omega, the yin and the yang, binary and singular, the stars aligning in the non-duality nature of existence. And it&#8217;s not that hard. Put it on the bucket list and list it under the Skills and Attributes section of your resume.</p>
<p>The heavy bass electronic notes in this one are based on the principle &#8211; they&#8217;re on the 4 as a cross rhythm over the dominant 3 pulse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably the most electronic sounding song on the record. But it&#8217;s all set against the screeching cello banshee-isms and held together by the soaring diva stylings of the inimitable Bright Fite.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Bask&#8217;</h2>
<p>&#8216;Bask&#8217; features Eva Popov of Hello Satellites fame and it nearly never was. Someone broke into my house and stole my laptop with all the instrumental, and most gravely, Eva&#8217;s vocal tracks on it. It was an opportunistic crime. All they took were the mobile electronics.</p>
<p>Did they listen to the Logic file still open on the screen? Did they like the melodic contour of Eva&#8217;s vocal in call and response with the strings counter melody so lovingly multi-tracked in Sunshine Studio 1? Did they notice the odd, unco, off kilter beats on the drums interspersed throughout the track? Did they have a moment with the questioning yet self-affirming lyrics that sings of the movers and shakers, the doers and be-ers, the right place at the right timers, the in their own skinners, the happy-and-you-know-it-ers?  These are all questions that will remain mysteries in the margins of the footnotes of the more obscure annals of the history of Melbourne pop music. Perhaps the most pressing question is how they managed to miss the infinite latent cash producing potential of this mega-hit that had just fallen into their fingertips. That song could have kept their kids shit-faced through college.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have this export of the file as it was being worked on at the time. And will have to suffice.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Renraku&#8217;</h2>
<p>Renraku means ?contact? and it&#8217;s part of small but ever growing repertoire of songs I&#8217;ve written in Japanese. The main line in it translates as ?We only make contact when we need to but recently there hasn&#8217;t been a need?. It&#8217;s only slightly less wordy in Japanese. It&#8217;s about how people can be so close and then end up so distant. Now you&#8217;re just somebody that I used to know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sung by Hiroko Nishimoto from the Kyoto duo Tayutau with support from Melbourne local off-weird pop pioneer and student of the Japanese, Sui Zhen. We had both been playing in Tayutau&#8217;s backing band for their triumphant seven-show tour of inner-northern suburban Melbourne. You gotta rope these people in when they&#8217;re drifting through and are still off balance, not in an appropriate state of mind to formulate a coherent knock back.</p>
<p>I love the live feel we captured on this track. Everything is completely real time. No overdubs. We only had one mic for Hiroko and Sui Zhen so they had to physically take turns Beatles style. Akiko from Tayutau ripped out a blazing violin solo for the chorus reprise. Yuko, friend of the band and impromptu tambourine player, goes totally out of time and then gives up the ghost in the bridge (but is otherwise totally in the pocket the whole way through). The lead vocal is popping with personality. It&#8217;s the real deal.</p>

<h2>&#8216;How Will We Split Up All The Furniture&#8217;</h2>
<p>Somebody at work said that. Talking about their upcoming marriage. Do you ever get the feeling that everyone around you is talking in a near constant stream of song titles? Like they&#8217;ve all met up in a room for a highly productive brain storming session before-hand and then take it in turns to approach you to reel off the fruits of their work one by one? That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve got your antenna up. Maybe a little too high. Like you&#8217;re trying to get the World Cup and you&#8217;re tuning into animal porn.</p>
<p>This track has a kind of country-meets-Eurovision feel to it and features the breathy, intimate, motherly vocals of Lucy Jean Roleff. The work friend is still with hubby.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Sunshine Pool&#8217;</h2>
<p>Along with &#8216;Dear Joseph&#8217; this one started out as song from a set of miniatures I was posting online for a while called ?Status Update Songs? which were written and often recorded on location, plein air, and in the moment in airports, beaches, forests and, in this case, swimming pools. It discusses the arbitrary nature of laps, and by extension, existence more generally.</p>
<p>Such a topic calls for vocoder, naturally. So there&#8217;s quite a bit of that in the mix around Oblako Lodka Irit Rozenfeld&#8217;s lead vocal.</p>
<p>Sunshine could be a Western Melbourne Suburb, a warmth emanating from a heavenly orb, or a state of mind. You decide. But it&#8217;s the suburb.</p>

<h2>&#8216;I Left You A Message&#8217;</h2>
<p>Brite Fite gets a little greedy on this one by coming back for a second track.</p>
<p>This one was written for a short film about two ladies working through mental health issues. There is quite a lot of phoning around, hence the song title.</p>
<p>As is usually the way with these things, the song ended up on the cutting room floor and they used &#8216;Bask&#8217; instead. So if anyone is making, or thinking of making, a film about two women working through mental health issues this track would work really well with it. Give us a call. Anytime. Leave a message.</p>
