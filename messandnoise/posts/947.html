<h2>?A Bitter Projection?</h2>
<p>How many times have you heard the words ?I think that&#8217;s a bit of projection going on there? coming from someone who doesn&#8217;t want to own up to something? I kinda wrote the song but [Spencer] came up with a lot of rhymes for it. All the Lugosi&#8217;s karma stuff is his.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77222608&amp;show_artwork=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?I Asked for Water?  </h2>
<p>At our first collaborative show, I&#8217;m halfway through my solo set prior to the both of us getting up for a set together and Spencer gets up quite intoxicated and starts to play the Gun Club song ?Cool Drink of Water?, which I know better as ?I Asked for Water? by Howlin? Wolf. I haven&#8217;t a clue what the lyrics are, except for ?I asked for water/She gave me gasoline,? so I pretty much have to make up my own lyrics and not let on. I&#8217;d never actually made lyrics up on the spot in front of an audience before, but I had no choice. The lyrics on our recorded version are a combination of what I could remember after another listen to Howlin Wolf&#8217;s version, what I could remember of what I made up on that first show and what I could make up and write down just prior to recording.</p>
<p>Spencer went in afterwards and put down some tambourine and made some kind of stomping sound with a cushion or something.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77205711%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vDvSg&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?I Need Somebody?  </h2>
<p>Stooges obviously got some significance for me. This song&#8217;s bluesy feel makes it a good inclusion alongside ?I Asked for Water?.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77205975%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vf7gv&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Is That All There Is??  </h2>
<p>This Peggy Lee classic is something I&#8217;ve wanted to do since I heard it in the early days of The Surrealists. I&#8217;d heard it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_1278">Magic 693</a> one day , met up with [Brian] Hooper and [Tony] Pola (Surrealists rhythm section) and they&#8217;d both independently heard it on the way over on their car radios and thought it would be great for us to do. Somehow the autobiographical take eluded me and we never got round to doing the song.</p>
<p>It was apparent from the start that this project would have an inherent autobiographical aspect to it and this song begged us to have a go at it. My monologue is pretty much the tale of my first gig and Spencer&#8217;s hilarious rant was some off-the-cuff but 100% true thing he came up with on our last Old Bar residency show. It&#8217;s rendered verbatim on our record, so I think he must have learned it from a DVD someone gave to us of that show.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77206180%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-lZK6g&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?It&#8217;s all the Same?   </h2>
<p>Came up with this pretty, jangly guitar-pop thing, which is probably not a style one would associate with Spencer and I. The first line that popped into my head when I tried to come up with a melody was ?Misogyny is such a tragic bitch,? which is quite dark compared to the sound of the music. That combination made me think it would be good for us two to do. Spencer helped me with some rhymes and wrote the lyrics for the second verse.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2>?Jack on Fire?  </h2>
<p>What can I say? It&#8217;s my fave song off The Gun Club&#8217;s <em>Fire of Love</em> album. Spencer was in The Gun Club when they toured Australia back in ?83, coinciding with when the Beasts of Bourbon were <a href="/articles/4558145">doing their first shows</a>. This song has some history for us.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77206741%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Yy9m6&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Loose Ends?  </h2>
<p>?Loose Ends? words were something I jotted down (i.e. put in notes on my iPhone) at the airport when I was actually at a loose end waiting for my plane back to Perth for a gig last year. When we were working up some material for the album, Spencer asked me if I liked ?free jazz? guitarist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Sharrock">Sonny Sharrock</a>. I fancied that I might from what little I&#8217;d heard. Anyway, Spencer had some chords that he thought might have a Sharrock groove, to which I started freestyling all over and, lo and behold, it sounded like what I remembered. I made up a one-note vocal melody and put my words to it. When we&#8217;d recorded it in the studio, it was suggested by Adrian <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=dh3bleXWaCk">Akkerman], our engineer, that there was a touch of Funkadelic&#8217;s [?Maggot Brain?</a> in the mix as well. I pretty much told Spencer to put a monologue over the top somewhere in the song. He pretty much came up with the goods on the spot.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77207232%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-LM0SO&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?The Monkey?  </h2>
<p>Really just Spencer&#8217;s song ?The Monkey has Gone? made instrumental. The song with vocals put me very much in mind of Leon Russell, which made it a definite one for inclusion, but when Spencer decided he wanted it more for a solo project he decided to do a guitar melody instead of the vocal. Given that there&#8217;s a bit of a jazz flavour to some songs on our album, I thought a tenor sax [by Ross Beaton from Eagle &amp; The Worm] would put it more into that context and it really works that way for me!</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77207894%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-X9mdB&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Runaway?  </h2>
<p>?Runaway? came about because, well, I&#8217;d wanted to do a version of it since I first saw the video for it on <em>Rage</em>. Spencer mentioned when we got together to jam for our first shows that he&#8217;d met Kanye at Big Day Out, which was enough of a prompt for me to break out into my version. It needed to have rapping on it, but I couldn&#8217;t do those lines ?24/7/365 pussy stays on my mind, alright I admit it? etc.</p>
<p>So I thought I&#8217;d do something appropriate to a 55-year-old Australian muso. Spencer did a pretty wild guitar part for the song, but I felt it needed him to rap as well. He wrote the rhymes just prior to recording them. This is what we did for a lot of the album. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s done a rap before and I think it pushed him out of his comfort zone, but it was worth it!</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Scorched Earth Pearl?  </h2>
<p>Mostly Spencer&#8217;s baby. I see it as the whole ?she done him wrong song? identified and pathologised, which kind of make it a whole other (and much better) thing. I think Spencer was keen, when he found out I played the banjo, to have it on something we did, and this is an obvious candidate. My contribution to the song is the Byrds rip-off banjo refrain and a bit of Zeppelin in the feel &#8211; although I&#8217;m sure he was coming from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=NbQ0Cb6h3Ew">?Bron-Y-Aur Stomp?</a> angle himself.</p>

<h2>?Underclass?  </h2>
<p>This is Spencer&#8217;s rearrangement of an Alex Chilton <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=nNeAk1gKR_c">song</a>. I&#8217;d never bothered to get my head around the simple chord structure, preferring to just make up something on the spot every time. What I play has settled into a kind of jazzy groove, which Ross Beaton picked up on when adding sax to ?The Monkey?. He added some of his tenor to go with my backing vocals for this track while he was at it. I&#8217;ve always thought Spencer&#8217;s version of this song was an example when the original hadn&#8217;t necessarily lived up to its potential and needed someone else to realise it.</p>

<h2>?The Whole of the Law?  </h2>
<p>This Only Ones song title quotes a line from Aleistier Crowley&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary<em>of</em>a<em>Drug</em>Fiend">Diary of a Drug Fiend</a></em> &#8211; something like ?Do what thou wilt &#8211; that be the whole of the law.? I read the book a few months before going into the studio and gave the book to someone for who this song was a favourite, so it seemed timely to throw the song into the mix. I liked Spencer&#8217;s take on the song and tried to go away from the original with my slide guitar.</p>
