                <h3>When his band deserted him, Sparkadia&#8217;s Alex Burnett decided to decamp to London and create his own private universe, writes <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3019579/439x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
After the rest of his Sydney-based band Sparkadia jumped ship, Alex Burnett did something unexpected: he retreated to England to record an epic second album on his own. Ultimately working with Mark Tieku of Florence and the Machine fame, he conceived <em>The Great Impression</em> as a private universe of whooshing synths, itchy hooks and outsized choruses. His floaty vocals and universal themes of isolation seal the deal on singles like ?China?, ?Mary? and ?Talking Like I&#8217;m Falling Down the Stairs?, all positioning Burnett as a commercial force both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The first Sparkadia album, 2008?s <em>Postcards*, was also recorded in London, albeit with a full band. But *The Great Impression</em> is a single-minded vision sprung from Burnett&#8217;s lonesome demos. As he explains it, those same demos led him both to Tieku and the current touring line-up of Sparkadia. They also put him on track to realise his own pop anthems on the same grand scale as his musical heroes.</p>
<p><strong>The band was reduced to just you on this record, but instead of making some quiet little solo thing you made this huge, expansive record. How did that happen?</strong><br/>
Like you said, I thought it&#8217;d be so cliche for me to get the acoustic out and go to LA to make a ?woe is me?-type record. The music I love is usually quite expansive. It just felt right to go there. I didn&#8217;t question it too much. These sort of mini-movies in four minutes felt exciting to write. I just kept going and didn&#8217;t stop until it was done. Or until I thought it was too ridiculous and then pared it back a bit, but I didn&#8217;t have to do that too often.</p>
<p><strong>How much of that was already realised before you hooked up with Mark Tieku?</strong><br/>
I had most of the demos done before I moved to London. I made some with Pip [Norman] from TZU and made some just by myself in my bedroom. I travelled around the world and recorded demos in a hotel in Stockholm that formed the basis of some of the songs. So when I did go to London, I had the blueprint. But working with Mark was great because he loved the demos and just wanted to expand upon them and make the songs as interesting and wild as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first get on to him?</strong><br/>
It was a few different twists and turns. When I moved over, the song ?China? was being passed around by a few people. I don&#8217;t know how it got leaked, but it&#8217;s one of those things. Through that I met this girl whose stage name is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cocknbullkid">CocknBullKid</a>, and he&#8217;d written a few songs with her and for her. I met him and he said, ?Oh, you&#8217;re the ?China? guy. I love the song. What else have you got?? With that in mind, I played him a few others and he said we should make this record. He seemed like the right guy. I didn&#8217;t want to work with a producer and have their sound too much on the record, because I was really happy with the demos.</p>
<p><strong>In another interview, you said you were getting inspired by UK acts like Florence and the Machine and La Roux.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I think it was the intention of those records more than the actual sonic landscape or the songs. I love those records because they were being played on commercial radio and sort of crossed over, but they weren&#8217;t written for a commercial audience. Some of the Florence and the Machine songs are so weird. There&#8217;s no chorus half the time, and she&#8217;s wailing, and there&#8217;s harpsichord in the background. But I just love that as an artist she really wanted to push herself and aim to be unique, as opposed as to just another girl with songs. Because I didn&#8217;t have a band, I wanted to do a similar thing, in a non-acoustic, singer-songwriter way. Moving to London and making the record there felt like the right move, because those records had come out of there.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>So you could sort of build this world around you without needing a full band?</strong><br/>
I think so. I mean, because the guys left on their own accord, it was too soon to find another band and record a live recording. And also, because I was really happy making demos by myself, the concept of going over and working with a producer and just making these songs on our own felt great.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s also this theme on the album of being alone and isolated and lost, so it makes sense to do those songs on your own.</strong><br/>
Yeah, exactly. Who knows, if we keep touring and doing a million shows with this band, the next record might be with them. But at the time, there was a real sense of making it by myself, by hook or by crook. As long as I stay inspired and try not to get too depressed about eating baked beans every day, it was going to work.</p>
<p><strong>So who is playing with you now, and when did that come together?</strong><br/>
Well, after the record was made, the label in Australia [Ivy League] released ?Talking Like I&#8217;m Falling Down the Stairs?. It started to do really well and Little Red asked us on tour. So I went, ?Okay, I suppose I&#8217;m touring again now.? By living in London writing songs with people or for people, when the record was made I met all these incredible musicians. So when it came to the tour, I just called upon friends of friends. I think because I passed the record around to a few people and they really loved it, I kept on getting people asking if they could audition. I had never really done auditions before. It felt like a creepy concept, but over there it&#8217;s sort of a normal thing to do. We had these auditions and found the most charming lads and the best players and just started playing with them a lot, trying to make sure it felt right. From there we came to Australia and did the Little Red tour. Since then, we&#8217;ve been touring everywhere. They&#8217;re English lads and they love to party, but playing music is their full-time job, so that&#8217;s the life they want to live.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I never wanted to be trendy or overhyped or whatever. I never found that I could grow my hair or cut my hair quick enough.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>You said earlier that sometimes you&#8217;d have to bring the songs back a little, but not often. And there is this really earnest, flamboyant, almost cheesiness to the album. Did you want it to be this form of expression where you didn&#8217;t couch anything?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I mean, I never wanted to be trendy or overhyped or whatever. I never found that I could grow my hair or cut my hair quick enough. I think it&#8217;s the same with songwriting. I&#8217;ve always loved songwriters or artists who were brutally honest and at times uncomfortably honest. They went there, as opposed to hiding behind something. I think that&#8217;s really brave to do, so I suppose with this record that all came into it. I just wanted to be really brutally honest. So it&#8217;s strange having the album being released tomorrow [March 18].</p>
<p><strong>Because it&#8217;s so personal?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s very personal. I&#8217;m not hiding behind anything or chasing the trends.</p>
<p><strong>This album has these massive choruses that are often elevated above the rest of the song. Do choruses come first when you&#8217;re writing?</strong><br/>
No. I mean, I&#8217;m not a songwriter that thinks about that. It&#8217;s usually that the songs start from concepts, more like a vision or an idea. And then in a circular fashion I build out from there. It&#8217;s never really a linear concept. I suppose with a song like ?China?, it&#8217;s all about tension, release, and human frailty and breaking points. So when the verse came out, it was the most tense verse you could possibly think of. Because of that, it felt like it needed the most bombastic release possible. I suppose I was into music that was written in the early ?90s, like soft-loud-soft-loud. Because the first record was much more subtle and slow. But I&#8217;m never too strategic about songwriting in terms of thinking about choruses or the length of the song. Because a lot of the songs that are my favourites are the weird pop songs that really shouldn&#8217;t have been hits.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve mentioned ?China? a few times, and I have to ask: when the chorus kicks in, it sounds a lot like the Who song ?Baba O&#8217;Riley?. Were you aware of that at the time?</strong><br/>
To be honest, I don&#8217;t really know The Who that well. Someone pointed that out, but it was never really brought up with Mark or anyone else I played it to [initially]. It&#8217;s just one of those situations where it&#8217;s a chord sequence that&#8217;s probably in about 50 other songs. I thought it was more like [Bachman-Turner Overdrive&#8217;s] ?Ain&#8217;t Seen Nothing Yet?. But it&#8217;s hard with music, once you start going down that route of something sounds something. You never end.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>But since we are going down this road, I wanted to bring up a few things that came to my mind while listening to the record, like Bowie, Roxy Music, and Kate Bush. Were any of those touchstones for you?</strong><br/>
Yeah, definitely. Definitely Kate Bush&#8217;s <em>Hounds of Love* played a big part in the record. And *Avalon* by Roxy Music &#8211; I listened to that record quite a bit. Bowie, especially from the *Berlin* era, really excited me. Some of the weird tracks on *Low* and *Lodger</em> I found kind of thrilling. There&#8217;s so much other stuff that came into it as well. But I love what those artists were doing. Like, a song like ?More Than This? is a weird pop song. There&#8217;s a minute-and-a-half of just noodling at the end, which I thought was great. And it was a bit of a mistake song, which I love.</p>
<p><strong>How close is the final version of ?China? to the demo that was circulating?</strong><br/>
Pretty similar. We did record a lot of different things and add to it and take away from it, but the chorus and the lyrics and the melody and the groove are the same. We just made it bigger and bolder.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like a special song for you, in that it set a lot of things into motion.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I guess so. But the song ?Mary? as well has been exciting people, and that&#8217;s the other song I played for Mark and he loved and thought was undeniable. But I&#8217;m never uber confident about anything. I didn&#8217;t expect the success of ?Talking??. It&#8217;s art &#8211; you can&#8217;t really force it. That&#8217;s the most frustrating thing for me about doing music, but also the most exciting. And to be able to do music as a job is amazing, so I&#8217;m by no means complaining or worried about it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;re in London to stay?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. When I moved to London, I moved to make this record and see what happened. And everything&#8217;s been going fantastic. And things are happening in Australia a lot, so I think home is Australia and London, which is interesting. It means I can come back to Australia and enjoy the fresh food and sunshine and see my family and friends, and then go back to England and have an English summer and do all those festivals. I like the concept of having two sets of homes.</p>
<p><strong>So the next album will probably be written in England?</strong><br/>
Maybe, yeah. We&#8217;ll just have to see.</p>
<p><strong>Have you written anything since finishing this album?</strong><br/>
Well, I only finished basically a day before Christmas, but there are a few songs I&#8217;ve written and a couple that really excite me. I&#8217;d like to make another record as soon as possible, when the songs are right, but I suppose we&#8217;re at this stage now where we push it out to water and see what happens. You get love and you get hate and you get everything else in between. Some songs connect on radio and others don&#8217;t, or you get a song in a movie. All that stuff is sort of up to the gods now.</p>
