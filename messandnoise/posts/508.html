                <h3>Karl Scullin might eat the same food and wear the same clothes every day, but his approach to music is essentially transitory. He talks to <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> about stripping things back for the new Kes Trio album, the colourful ?Black Brown Green Grey White?.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014507/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There&#8217;s just no painting Karl Scullin into a corner. Under various incarnations of Kes, he&#8217;s done the solo acoustic thing, the full band thing, the instrumental thing, and now the harsh rock thing with Kes Trio&#8217;s new album. Punctuated by screams, <em>Black Brown Green Grey White* also offers beautiful singing, playing and production. It&#8217;s not schizophrenic so much as restless, jumping from one bold tangent to the next with freakish precision. Backed by Julian Patterson &#8211; Scullin&#8217;s bandmate in the reportedly defunct Mum Smokes &#8211; and Lehmann Smith, Kes Trio proves worlds apart from the five-piece heard on last year&#8217;s marvellous *<a href="/releases/2000381">Kes Band II</a></em>. There&#8217;s preening art-rock and unhinged madness sitting hand-in-hand. Self-aware without being awkwardly meta and adventurous without being pretentious, it&#8217;s utterly Kes.</p>
<p><strong>What happened in between the Kes Band and Kes Trio albums?</strong><br/>
Just a natural evolution of doing shows, I guess. The three-piece thing was more economic, sound-wise and also just doing gigs. But it was more just that it had run its natural course, that five-piece thing. I felt we had done as much as we could, and everyone had other things they needed to do. It seemed like the natural thing to do. I don&#8217;t think it was too much of an intellectual process to strip it down. [<em>Pauses</em>] It was 50/50. I did wanna go for a more rock sound, like more aggressive, and try that. But at the same time, the five-piece thing had run its course anyway and I wasn&#8217;t going to try and force a round peg into a square hole.</p>
<p><strong>The last album was almost like classical music, between the choice of instruments and being instrumental. Did you maybe just have the opposite reaction with this one?</strong><br/>
I guess so. They were happening at the same time. When we were writing all the stuff for <em>Kes Band II*, we were playing live as a trio. So I was working on that and finishing up *Kes Band II</em> at the same time. I think most people work that way: you work on something new and yet you still have to finish putting out something that&#8217;s older.</p>
<p><strong>Did they play off each other then?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t think so. I guess they may have, but not really from my point of view. I was just trying to make them cohesive things in their own right. Especially the instrumental album: we did have a few rock songs that could have gone on that, but it was to keep the atmosphere of it consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever consider keeping these newer songs instrumental?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I&#8217;m somewhat disillusioned with vocals. I think the trio album pretty much just documents what the Kes project has been doing live for the last year and a half, which is kind of half really abrasive rock and [half] more traditional songwriting with vocals. One of the reasons I did that was to keep the live show quite dynamic, with a lot of light and shade. I don&#8217;t really like seeing too many bands who have just one sound and it&#8217;s like you have 45 minutes of this variation on one song or one sound. I wanted to really have space and just have one thing playing at a time. Those are the kinds of things that I&#8217;m attracted to: the inherent dynamics in music.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3014508/350x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Some of the vocals on the new album aren&#8217;t lyrical devices but just screams and other mouth sounds.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Well, Lehmann sings a song and Julian sings a song, songs they&#8217;ve brought and written as well. I wanted to make the trio thing more complete by doing that. Also, it just broke it up as a live thing. If you&#8217;ve got people that can sing, you should have different singers. But I&#8217;m pretty disillusioned with trad songwriting and I&#8217;m thinking more about experimental music these days. I&#8217;ve always been into screaming, and trying to have voice with no lyrics was something I thought I&#8217;d definitely like to try. There&#8217;s a lot more I&#8217;d like to try with that, like maybe just doing screaming, without a band.</p>
<p><strong>You mean without any music at all?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve had this idea for a while to just build upon screaming. Just get people together screaming and collect them over time and build songs out of this voice that is screaming. I haven&#8217;t really explored it, but I think there&#8217;s something in it.</p>
<p><strong>Well, there&#8217;s so much range in a person&#8217;s scream, and everyone&#8217;s scream is different.</strong><br/>
Definitely. I&#8217;d be curious to see what you could get out of people as well. [<em>Laughs</em>] Especially groups of people, how it would work.</p>
<p><strong>And it has this sort of release effect on you, obviously.</strong><br/>
And it&#8217;s a pretty basic sound. Like, it&#8217;s not complicated. It&#8217;s not a love song and it&#8217;s not talking about a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>You used to be in Bird Blobs [from 2001-2003]. Wasn&#8217;t that band closer to a volatile, almost evil sound?</strong><br/>
Definitely. I guess they were coming from a more Pop Group/Birthday Party/Beefheart place.</p>
<p><strong>Did it occur to you that you were maybe getting back to that with this record?</strong><br/>
I guess so. Everyone listens to rock music when they&#8217;re a teenager or whatever, so that&#8217;s obviously my reference point, my starting point. So things that I&#8217;ve done have always been different to that, but that&#8217;s always been the staple I guess. Even though a lot of people think I&#8217;m twee and folky or something, this trio record is more of where I&#8217;ve always thought I was coming from.</p>
<p><strong>Because it is collaborative and the other guys are bringing songs to the table, did you ever think about giving it a non-Kes band name?</strong><br/>
No, definitely not. Because I&#8217;m definitely the leader of the band, and I&#8217;m definitely crafting it and directing what&#8217;s happening. I have other bands that I&#8217;m in where it&#8217;s more genuinely collaborative, where there is no leader. But I think, no, this is clearly a Kes record for sure.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The five-piece thing had run its course anyway and I wasn&#8217;t going to try and force a round peg into a square hole.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What other bands are you currently in?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m doing this band with this girl Ela [Stiles] from a band called Songs and this other girl Nisa [Venerosa] from Fabulous Diamonds. We&#8217;ve almost finished recording an album. This year we&#8217;ve been focusing on doing that. It&#8217;s called Zsa Zsa.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve seen that name on bills and just thought it was some young band.</strong><br/>
Well, we are a young band. It&#8217;s early days. Ela started it but she lives in Sydney, so our process is sort of bound to whenever she can come down. But I&#8217;m pretty happy with how the album sounds and the amount of work we&#8217;ve done for it.</p>
<p><strong>I interviewed Jonathan Michell recently and he said Mum Smokes had run its course. Is that right?</strong><br/>
Well, y&#8217;know, I never say never, but we&#8217;re not playing any live shows, that&#8217;s for sure. And there&#8217;s no recording [planned]. Yeah, I think it&#8217;s run its course for now.</p>
<p><strong>Is that just because everyone&#8217;s involved in so many other things?</strong><br/>
I guess so. Being in a band is never easy. I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ll never do anything again, but it&#8217;s definitely not on the cards at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>On the new trio album, there&#8217;s this sustained feedback bridging the songs ?The Alarm Clock? and ?Won Seventeen?. It&#8217;s quite piercing.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s actually a clarinet, not feedback, but it is just like a frequency. It does sound like it could be feedback. I&#8217;m really into albums that blend together like that. Again, that&#8217;s more of an indication of what the live show was. I try not to have too many clapping breaks in between songs. I find it much better to have like four songs and craft them so they go into each other. Something about it is more interesting for me to play live. A block of songs together, as opposed to three minutes, clapping, three minutes, clapping.</p>
<p><strong>It can be almost like a suite, to have these distinct parts lead naturally into each other.</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally. And I love stripping stuff back to just one person and a sound. I think it&#8217;s crazy when bands are just like guitar intro, drums for three minutes, and everyone&#8217;s playing [the whole time]. I think that&#8217;s crazy talk. All that space around what&#8217;s not playing is what creates atmosphere, to me?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re listening to rock stations or triple j or pop music, the sound is really unappealing or un-intriguing. And when I listened to the classical stations, like when I was doing that Kes Band II thing, you hear like a nylon string guitar or just one thing doing something. It&#8217;s just instantly inviting. It instantly makes me want to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there many non-rock instruments besides clarinet on the album?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s pretty much it. We recorded at Head Gap in Preston, and my friend had just dropped off a Mellotron. So on songs like ?Wise Eyes?, there is this keyboard-y, flute-y kind of sound. Tarquin [Manek, Pikelet/Bum Creek] plays clarinet. He&#8217;s the only additional person. Otherwise it&#8217;s just the three of us.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like there are more effects on this record.</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. With the live show, I&#8217;ve really been becoming a bit of a pedal nerd. I&#8217;ve got a pedal board now. My effects are pretty standard: they&#8217;re just delay and reverb and distortions. But I&#8217;ve definitely been crafting my electric guitar sound and experimenting with drones and feedbacks a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>You produced it with Nao Anzai. What was the impetus to work with him specifically?</strong><br/>
Well, he&#8217;s our live mixer. And he&#8217;s a really prominent figure in the Melbourne music scene. He mixes a lot of live shows that you would go to. I can&#8217;t recommend him highly enough. He&#8217;s really easy to communicate with and is very organised. I think he&#8217;s made the record sound really good, like the actual fidelity of it. He&#8217;s done some stuff where the drums are quite live and distorted-sounding, which is great.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Like I said, it sounds sort of evil at times.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s interesting you say it sounds a bit evil. I think with my disillusionment with just songs, I&#8217;m going in a direction that&#8217;s &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t say evil, but just darker I guess.</p>

<strong>I&#8217;m curious about the album cover, because the second Kes Band cover was a variation on the first. And you could have very easily done another variation on that for this.</strong><br/>
I see them as separate projects. Kes is me solo, Kes Band is with a band of any number of people, and Kes Trio is obviously a trio, so I just wanted to keep it separate. I think if I do another Kes Band record, I will continue with the handwriting <a href="/galleries/3985555">on the cover]. But I see this as something new, the trio thing. And I&#8217;m [into photography</a>. I just wanted to have something that was graphic, almost comic book-y graphic, that was like a symbol that could be quite recognisable. I was thinking about representing three and the different ways I could do that.</p>
<p><strong>What about the title [<em>Black Brown Green Grey White</em>]? I know it&#8217;s the name of a song, but was it just to put all these colours and images together?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I guess you could say they&#8217;re &#8211; a few of my favourite colours. [<em>Laughs</em>] I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s evocative.</p>
<p><strong>You get the alliteration and you also imagine the colours in your head.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I had a film clip idea for that song, because it has this beat where it&#8217;s kind of changing, to have the colours change every time the chord changes. But I have yet to make that film clip.</p>
<p><strong>Have you made film clips before?</strong><br/>
Never. [<em>Laughs</em>] But I think visually a lot, and I really should do a film clip. But I&#8217;m not really into sitting in front of the computer to edit it. And I think because I&#8217;m a control freak, it would get to the point where I would have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to work on after launching this record?</strong><br/>
I just want to get back into finishing the projects I&#8217;ve got on the go, I guess. Record and maybe get back into playing solo live as well. Because I have heaps of new solo material. But I guess it&#8217;s much of the same in that I just want to try a few different angles.</p>
<p><strong>How will the solo stuff sound, if you&#8217;re getting away from traditional singing and songs?</strong><br/>
Well, there&#8217;s a bit of ranting going on. Since I finished my first acoustic album, <em>The Jelly Is In The Pot</em>, I&#8217;ve been just working on that style of guitar and voice. And really crafting these new songs a lot. It&#8217;s similar, but it&#8217;s just way darker. I guess you might say it is a little bit evil. It&#8217;s like that songwriting template, but very broken down. It&#8217;s definitely not someone on stage strumming up and down on the guitar and saying words. I&#8217;m breaking it down and working on the most interesting arrangements I can think of. I think lyrically I&#8217;m a lot more realised as well. Definitely the songs that I&#8217;m writing now have a very definite bottom line to them. So they&#8217;re more articulate in a way.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like you thrive on these different phases. Do you think that&#8217;s fair to say?</strong><br/>
Yes and no. I&#8217;m just trying to survive, really. I would love to just do one thing, but being in a band, there are so many elements that make it transitory. Like, people&#8217;s interest in doing it and also your living arrangements and what you can afford time-wise to do. But I guess ages ago, I just embraced that element of it. It&#8217;s always going to be changing. And whoever&#8217;s around that can do stuff to make it happen, you should embrace them but not try and hold on to what you had, because it&#8217;s just going to be a waste of time. In a lot of parts of my life, I&#8217;m very routine. I wear the same clothes every day, I eat the same food all the time. But the music thing, there&#8217;s something about it. When you make a record, it&#8217;s inherently transitory. You can&#8217;t do it again. It&#8217;s that document of what you could do at that time, and I think it&#8217;s inherent in the medium of making a recording.</p>
<p><strong>And so many people in Melbourne are constantly playing with other people and travelling, which breaks things up.</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally. And it&#8217;s fun to do different stuff, to try different things. Maybe on some level I have some kind of sound going on &#8211; like, I definitely have an aesthetic of things I like. Rustic is how I would describe it. Somewhat straightforward and naturalistic on some level. But there are so many different options to explore. Just like how that screaming option could be a thing. Just doing a minimal kind of atmospheric album would be a great thing to try. Just doing another rock band with like two basses and four drums would be a great thing to try. There&#8217;s heaps of options.</p>
