                <h3>Overflowing deluxe reissues of their first three albums remind us exactly why You Am I are national treasures, writes <strong>ANDREW P STREET</strong>. Spoiler: it&#8217;s because these are fucking great records.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3035618/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
You Am I have long toiled in the shadow of their first three albums, but now they can actually embrace this fact with these deluxe reissues. They&#8217;re throwing themselves into it too, with a <a href="/news/4573648">near-sold-out tour</a> for albums two and three, and <em>Sound as Ever* getting an airing as part of Splendour in the Grass. And listening back to their debut album again now, with the benefit of hindsight, you can see why it&#8217;s not getting quite the same level of celebration as *Hi Fi Way* and *Hourly, Daily</em>: it&#8217;s a strong record that only occasionally sounds like You Am I.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partially down to Tim Rogers? vocals: he&#8217;d soon become far more adept at pulling out that strangulated howl of his for deliberate effect rather than as the default setting. But it&#8217;s principally because of Mark Tunaley&#8217;s drumming: specifically, the use of double kick and those big Dave Grohl drum fills. In fact, with Tunaley behind the kit, those Nirvana comparisons that were made in the early days make a hell of a lot more sense.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s spirited and raw (those dry, upfront vocals in particular), with songs speeding up as they barrel along &#8211; most notably on the still magnificent ?Berlin Chair?. That and fellow singles ?Jaimme&#8217;s Got A Gal? and ?Adam&#8217;s Ribs? are the enduring classics, while many of the other songs sounds like they exist principally to give Silverchair ideas. (The US version of the album dropped Tulaney&#8217;s Tumbleweed-sounding ?Off the Field?, and rightly so.)</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nwsyr5gAEuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>The bonus disc contains B-sides, rarities and live recordings that mark the transition between the Tulaney period and the ?proper? You Am I with Rusty Hopkinson behind the kit. The solo acoustic ?Maker&#8217;s Mark? version of ?Jaimme&#8217;s Got a Gal? is lovely, and the choice of covers indicates where the band would be taking their cues from going forward: their take on The Who&#8217;s mod-tacular debut single ?Can&#8217;t Explain? is appropriately spirited, while the cover of John Lennon&#8217;s exhausted <em>White Album</em> classic ?I&#8217;m So Tired? has a menace the original lacks.</p>
<p>However, somewhat surprisingly, the tracks from the first EPs are not included, so those possessing the <em>Snake Tide*, *Can&#8217;t Get Started* and *Coprolalia</em> discs can rest assured their money was not wasted.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s not polished, but it&#8217;s damned exciting.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again, what&#8217;s here is pretty great. The sarcastic 12-bar blues of B-side ?20,000? is cute but slight, but the live-in-Seattle tracks show what a savage band the trio had become. This is the recording that made up the <em>Someone Else&#8217;s Crowd* live disc that was on the original *Hi Fi Way* pressing, but includes the previously absent ?Embarrassed? and a take of the classic ?Young Man&#8217;s Blues? (which in turn takes its cues from The Who&#8217;s *Live at Leeds</em>). Rogers? guitar work is on full display, and there are some lyrical substitutions and occasional musical flubs as they burn through their set. It&#8217;s not polished, but it&#8217;s damned exciting.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3035617/325x325-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
And then we&#8217;re on to the masterpiece. There&#8217;s little that can be said about <em>Hi Fi Way</em> that hasn&#8217;t already been covered to death by various Classic Australian Albums wrap ups: it still sounds amazing, thanks to the unobtrusive production (by Sonic Youth&#8217;s Lee Ranaldo), Hopkinson&#8217;s rock-solid drumming and some of the best songs Rogers was ever to write. The rockin? moments &#8211; ?Cathy&#8217;s Clown?, ?Jewels and Bullets?, ?Minor Byrd?, ?The Applecross Wing Commander? &#8211; have the guts of anything on the first album while showing a new appreciation of dynamics. And the more emotional moments &#8211; the still-heartstring-pulling ?Purple Sneakers?, the obsessive ?Handwasher? &#8211; punch one right in the feels.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Say what you like about Rogers, the man steals from the best.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, chord-based strums like ?She Digs Her? and the glorious closer ?How Much is Enough? signpost the sorts of songs that were to become a YAI mainstay going forward. (Although every time I listen to the coda I still expect it to turn into Teenage Fanclub&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ctYYFETItUc">?Everything Flows?</a>: say what you like about Rogers, the man steals from the best). Look, it&#8217;s a goddamn classic for a reason.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Uu3kNMncbZs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>The bonus disc is also superb, containing some of the best B-sides from this golden period: specifically, the swaggering blues of ?When You Got Dry? and the strummy ?Hi Fi Way?. There&#8217;s also a lovely double-acoustic-guitar version of Chris Bell&#8217;s ?You and Your Sister?, along with throwaways like ?Sci Fi Way? (a pastiche of ?Telstar?-style ?60s guitar instrumentals), and the snide two-minute punk of ?Bitter Young Man of the Fanzine Press?.</p>
<p>Then there are live recordings, including a <em>Live at the Wireless</em> and several Sydney live recordings, including a version of ?Handwasher? that starts life as the Beatles? ?Things We Said Today? and an unhinged version of the Spencer Davis Group&#8217;s ?I&#8217;m a Man?.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3035616/350x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="350" height="350"/><br/>
Finally, <em>Hourly, Daily*. Barely a year after *Hi Fi Way</em> the band returned with a quasi-concept record about 24 hours in suburban Australia and from the opening title track it showed how ambitious the band had gotten: Mellotrons, cellos, and pianos accompanied Rogers? plaintive voice. And if ?Good Mornin?? was a return to the classic You Am I sound, no previous recording had boasted a production trick like the tinny AM radio compression of the opening verse. The singles continue with the glorious ?Mr Milk?, one of the band&#8217;s most jubilant songs and most blatant and shameless lifts &#8211; but even XTC would have to admit that they gave the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=SyX75NpibdU">?Senses Working Overtime?</a> bridge a hell of a new home &#8211; and then ?Soldiers? kicks in with jaunty brass.</p>
<p>The album&#8217;s somewhat frontloaded (side one also contains ?If We Can&#8217;t Get It Together? and ?Wally Raffles?, so it&#8217;s a damned hard act to follow). If the second side doesn&#8217;t hit the highs of the first, then it&#8217;s suffering more by comparison than from any intrinsic lack of quality, although ?Moon Shines on Trubble? should have been a Britpop smash.</p>
<blockquote><p>? But when you&#8217;re faced with reissues, the only question is whether they&#8217;re worth getting.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The bonus disc is basically You Am I Covers Corner: between the B-sides and a period live recording we get The Who&#8217;s ?Circles?, The Easybeats? ?I&#8217;ll Make You Happy? and ?She&#8217;s So Fine?, The Move&#8217;s ?I Can Hear the Grass Grow?, ?(There&#8217;s Gonna Be A) Showdown? by Archie Bell &amp; the Drells (via New York Dolls, and The Johnnies?), Iggy &amp; The Stooges? ?Search &amp; Destroy?, The Beatles? ?You Can&#8217;t Do That? and Dylan&#8217;s ?Tonight I&#8217;ll Be Staying Here With You?. But none hold a candle to the mighty Hopkinson-sung version of The Mummies? ?(You Must Fight To Live) On the Planet of the Apes?. As a window in the band&#8217;s record collections, it&#8217;s instructive if nothing else.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/H3RKfDyrmGM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe><br/>
</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re faced with reissues, the only question is whether they&#8217;re worth getting. After all, if you&#8217;re reading <em>Mess + Noise</em> there&#8217;s a greater-than-even chance that you&#8217;ve already got well-worn copies of these discs in your collection. Should you stump up again?</p>
<p>The answer&#8217;s a comprehensive yes, thanks to the bonus discs: if you don&#8217;t have the B-sides and live recordings they&#8217;re absolutely worthy of your attention. And if you do, then you&#8217;re clearly the sort of obsessive fan who&#8217;s hardly going to let the previously-unreleased tracks go by. It would have been nice to get the earliest tracks in there too, but what&#8217;s here is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>As a document of one of the most important Australian bands of the last 20 years, these are absolutely vital. But there&#8217;s a more important reason you should have them: they&#8217;re three fucking great albums.</p>
