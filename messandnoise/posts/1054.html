<h2>?Terra Nullius?  </h2>
<p>This one was written in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=QizyeEA3mL8">singer-guitarist] Dane [Taylor]?s stinking hot cube of a spare room. I think the first half of the song might be set in far north Queensland somewhere. It was built upon some chords and melodic ideas that [guitarist] Al [Webster] had at the time. I initially had some grand ideas about the speaker in the song being ?the land? but somewhere along the line it morphed into something else entirely. I was watching a lot of <em>[Bush Tucker Man</a></em> at the time. </p>
<p>The second half is intended to sound like an Australian version of NEU!. It was probably inspired by meditation, Ken Done and Dreamtime stories. Dane does an excellent job of channelling Robert Fripp on guitar. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712402%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-yMDzA"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Distant Dreaming?  </h2>
<p>?Distant Dreaming? was conceived at my house after hitting a dead end with another song I had been toiling with for weeks. I was just mucking around playing some keys over a ?90s-sounding hip-hop beat and Dane started casually playing guitar over the top. We freestyled a bunch of vocal ideas and ended up with the ?Caught in a distant dreamtime? refrain. It basically wrote itself from then on. I collaborated with our good friend and brilliant writer Jonathan Parks for the lyrics, who helped with words for at least half the album.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712390%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5eGSr"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Must Have Been Dreaming?  </h2>
<p>Dane and I have always wanted to write a song like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=C_7l65CBaTo">?Woman in Chains?</a> by Tears For Fears. We also have a deep love for John Hughes films, which seem to be a great way to experience teen angst and the blissful ignorance of youth again whilst quietly weeping to oneself. This song was also inspired by meditation, [Icehouse&#8217;s] ?Great Southern Land? and Australian opals. Johnny helped out with lyrics for this tune as well. Thanks mate!</p>
<p>The arpeggio guitar lines at the end came from Dane experimenting with one of his many guitar pedals. They take the track deep underwater somehow. Actually, the whole back half sounds like the movie <em>Drive</em>, but underwater.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712374%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-YDOlV"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Keep Warm?  </h2>
<p>This is actually ?Keep Warm 2.0?. The original version transformed into a totally different beast after we started playing it live. What was once a programmed sample is now the bouncy groove of [Nathan Stratton&#8217;s] live bass. Alastair and I spent an eternity working on the vocal breakdown to get it right.</p>
<p>The original version was loosely based on the story of Jamie Neale, who spent 11 days lost in the Blue Mountains in freezing conditions. We were staying there at the time he was found and there were rumours that the whole thing was a hoax. It&#8217;s also based on something I read about how Brian Wilson tried to create music that makes the listener feel loved. That&#8217;s what ?Keep Warm? is supposed to do.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712347%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-xNDQn"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Don&#8217;t Get Down on Yourself?  </h2>
<p>I remember Alastair and I went and stayed in Narrandera with Johnny for a while and we worked on the lyrics for this particular tune. We also had fires on the Murrumbidgee, set yabby traps and wandered around in fields that stretched from horizon to horizon. This song reminds me of the film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Year</em>My<em>Voice</em>Broke">The Year My Voice Broke</a></em>. Great movie.</p>
<p>I think this tune contains one of my favourite vocal performances from Dane. He manages to sound numb, heartbroken and desperate all at once.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712327%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-zdTk7"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?You Won&#8217;t Feel a Thing?  </h2>
<p>We started this one at a farm we rented out in Berry for a while. It was an amazing property on 25 acres of land with wombats everywhere. The song itself didn&#8217;t really take shape until later on, when I removed the beat and changed the chords. </p>
<p>For a while I was hearing and reading a lot about the ?inevitability? of moving to another planet when earth eventually becomes uninhabitable. The idea of saying goodbye to this country and planet forever is profoundly sad. For me, this song is about that feeling. And also about ghosts and anti-depressants.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100712318%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-CzhuN"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Stare into the Sun?  </h2>
<p>This song was also written in Dane&#8217;s spare room/sauna. We got this really cool sound running Dane&#8217;s acoustic through a chorus pedal he bought at Aldi. I remember Dane, Alastair and I just kept layering parts until all of a sudden I was inadvertently mumbling a chorus.</p>
<p>I feel like this track takes the mild euphoria on some of the other songs to a whole new level. I just wanted it to keep going up and up and up and up. It has an intense optimism that could almost be described as manic. I wanted everything in the song to sound bleached, sunburned or melted by an Australian sun.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104655910"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?The Last Wave?  </h2>
<p>This tune was written and produced by Alastair and was originally sitting in the <a href="/articles/4601862">Tropical Strength</a> ideas pile. At some point we realised it was a Shining Bird song and we got Dane to lay down some of his chocolate vox for the verses. I think this was the hardest song on the album to finish. It was like a series of locked doors that we tried a million different keys in before we entered each new phase. Sometimes we had to pick the lock.</p>
<p>This tune contains a sample from Peter Weir&#8217;s film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Last</em>Wave">The Last Wave</a></em>. We were lucky enough to contact Peter via Strat&#8217;s granddad (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stratton">David Stratton</a>) and get permission from the man himself. Which was awesome! We are all big fans of Peter Weir.</p>
