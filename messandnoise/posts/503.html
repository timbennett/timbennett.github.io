<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014331/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Warren Ellis takes his holidays in the south of France. The former Ballarat native now lives in Paris, so it&#8217;s not that exotic a location, but I can&#8217;t help but picture him in a pair of budgie smugglers roaming a pebbled beach like Tom Hanks in <em>Cast Away</em>. ?I&#8217;m down here for the end of the school holidays,? he says down a crackly phone line that suggest he&#8217;s doing just that. ?I&#8217;m looking forward to getting out and touring again.?</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t have to wait too long. Ellis and his cohorts in Grinderman &#8211; Nick Cave, Martyn Casey and Jim Sclavunos &#8211; are about to pimp their new album <em>Grinderman 2</em> on a 20-date European tour, which kicks off at Nottingham&#8217;s Rock City in the UK on September 25. Co-produced with Nick Launay, the album was culled down from hours of freeform studio jams, which Ellis admits was ?sometimes like listening to the biggest pile of shit you&#8217;ve ever heard in your life?. Thankfully, the finished product isn&#8217;t that arduous: nine songs of divergent style and consistency, including some genuine pop moments in ?Worm Tamer? and ?Palaces of Montezuma?, an acoustic ?Sympathy For The Devil?-esque romp, which promises the ?spinal chord of JFK wrapped in Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s negligee? for something as meager as a ?breathless word?. So much for The Birthday Party redux, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Was there a different approach to <em>Grinderman 2</em>?</strong><br/>
The approach was more or less the same, in the way we sat down and wrote the album, but the main difference was the attitude that we had. On the first album, we literally went into the studio to see what would happen. We didn&#8217;t have a name or anything for the group. It was very much about trying to find a sound in there [the studio]. With this one [<em>Grinderman 2</em>], we had a some sort of identity and we&#8217;d been playing shows, so there was something a bit more developed, further down the track. We could play the instruments with a bit more confidence. The first album was about trying to make something with very little. I think that&#8217;s the main difference for me. The fact that there&#8217;s some kind of history now going into the second one, some identity. </p>
<p>The process was the same. We&#8217;d go in for four or five days non-stop and record everything. At the end of that we&#8217;d sit down and try and find moments in among what was sometimes like listening to the biggest pile of shit you&#8217;ve ever heard in your life. Just trying to find moments that were different or inspired. It&#8217;s a really interesting process actually.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve whittled it down to nine songs. Were there others that didn&#8217;t make the cut?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a lot of stuff &#8211; I mean, inevitably there&#8217;d be stuff that sounded like it could be on a Bad Seeds record, and we&#8217;d leave that aside &#8211; I think we came out there with four CDs? worth of material of just differing ideas. There&#8217;s a logic behind it being short. It just harks back to a time when we all listened to records and they were short: 15 or 18 minutes a side. Listening to a 15-minute side seems to be a good length these days. When CDs came out, people felt like they had to fill them up, because it was 70 minutes, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it all was good. We had a couple songs that we finished that didn&#8217;t seem to fit on the record. I think there are three songs that didn&#8217;t appear on the record, which will probably appear as a B-side or maybe never come out.</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s a really diverse-sounding record. Do you see Grinderman as an opportunity to push the boat out further than, say, The Bad Seeds?</strong><br/>
Well, I think, just by the nature of the way the material is put together, there&#8217;s certainly more room for the music to be experimental for want of a better word. The music takes up more space than it may do otherwise. Nick [Cave] sings very differently when he&#8217;s working in that context. It&#8217;s become part of the whole thing as opposed to the weight of it being on the lyrics, which seems to be the case with The Bad Seeds. The lyrics and the story is driving it. Not to take away from The Bad Seeds, but he&#8217;s always written a lot, there&#8217;s not a lot of time when there&#8217;s not many lyrics going on. I think this is a chance to open it up in that respect. It feels like those ideas have spilled over into, particularly, the last Bad Seeds album [<em>Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!</em>]. It&#8217;s also just a phase, you know, where things are at the moment. Who knows where they&#8217;ll be next time?</p>
<blockquote><p>?We&#8217;d sit down and try and find moments in among what was sometimes like listening to the biggest pile of shit you&#8217;ve ever heard in your life.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting to hear you say that, because I read an interview with Nick recently, where he said he wanted to be more integrated in the music rather than the focal point.</strong><br/>
Generally, in the past, Nick would come in with 15 or so songs &#8211; when he felt like he had enough material together &#8211; and we&#8217;d go into the studio and work out how to play those songs and the treatment they should be given. It&#8217;s very different to being involved from the get-go, musically speaking. Nick found that being alone, he ended up being able to write a particular song, but when you&#8217;re on your own it&#8217;s hard to get certain things going, like a bassline for example &#8211; It&#8217;s a bit more like how when you start making music, just riffing off ideas and getting something going. It makes the phrasing really different. Quite often too, when we get together and do those few days in the beginning, Nick is adlibbing all the time and making up words that might sound good, but don&#8217;t mean anything. It gives you an idea to launch off and a different way to approach it. It keeps things looser and freer. We try to keep that improvised side open as well. When you go in with crafted songs you go in with a blueprint already. Grinderman was very much a way for us all to throw it up in the air a bit; to get away from some pre-ordained rules that have to happen when you&#8217;re playing in a group, particularly like one that&#8217;s been going on as long as The Bad Seeds have.</p>
<p><strong>Would you say it&#8217;s more democratic than The Bad Seeds?</strong><br/>
Um, I wouldn&#8217;t know how to comment on that. I came into The Bad Seeds in the ?90s. They&#8217;d always operate in a certain kind of way, and I think the general belief was that democracy took too long and decisions were made by fewer people. I wouldn&#8217;t say Grinderman is a democracy, no. There&#8217;s probably more involvement with everybody from the outset, but things have to move along fast, and that gets done but the people who can do it.</p>
<p><strong>So who&#8217;s driving the action?</strong><br/>
[<em>Pauses</em>] Ultimately, the ball lands in Nick&#8217;s court when it comes to the lyrics and what he feels like he can hang something off. If you look at it that way, I guess the buck stops with him &#8211; It certainly feels like it&#8217;s opened up within the group. There&#8217;s more of a group thing going on?</p>
<p><strong>Lyrically, the album seems less obsessed with sex.</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I thought there was a lot of sex in it, actually.</p>
<p><strong>I mean overtly.</strong><br/>
Yeah, maybe not. It&#8217;s interesting because he [Cave] seems to be writing from a person who&#8217;s his age, and writing about things that not too many people seem to write about at that age. Like trying to tap into their youth. We&#8217;re not trying to recapture our youth in any way whatsoever. Even the narrative is not about that at all. I think that&#8217;s really interesting. You don&#8217;t see a lot of people doing that lyrically.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that you talk about recapturing youth, because a lot of people mistook the first album as a Birthday Party rehash.</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally. That could never happen, it wasn&#8217;t an attempt to do that and it&#8217;s nothing like that at all. You can&#8217;t stop people thinking things, and anybody that&#8217;s got an axe to grind will just go in for you anyway, so fuck ?em. There was also a misconception that the album was just about dirty old men, or something. People have always done that, particularly with Nick&#8217;s stuff too. They&#8217;ve seen a certain thing that they&#8217;ve wanted to see, and then that&#8217;s it. They&#8217;ve never seen anything else beyond that. That&#8217;s their problem.</p>
<p><strong>Any chance of returning to Australia in the near future?</strong><br/>
I believe next year sometime. In the early part of the year, I think. Although it&#8217;s not definite.</p>
