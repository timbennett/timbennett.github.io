                <h3>Brisbane quartet <strong>MILLIONS</strong> recorded their debut album, ?Max Relax?, between their hometown and a London studio with Squeeze&#8217;s Glenn Tilbrook.

<h2>?Writing on the Wall?  </h2>
<p>We wrote this the last week we were in the studio in London. A lot of the guitar parts were written by Louis [Tilbrook, drummer] during a late-night jam whilst Ted [Tilbrook, guitarist] was checking on pizza in the oven. We left the mics rolling and you can hear us dribble on about food in between takes &#8230; Dom [Haddad, singer] finished the vocals back in Brisbane and it is now one of our favourite tracks on the album.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Always?  </h2>
<p>Everyone had a bit of a break from each other when we got back from London and this song came about at the start of the year. We were sitting around Ted&#8217;s room and it started with the chorus vocal, which is pretty uncommon for us. Campbell [Smith, bassist] played a tasty bass line and once the piano stabs were added, we pretty much had flesh and bones of the song.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158903694%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-2E2iE&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?B Chill?  </h2>
<p>Another one we wrote in the studio, ?B Chill? was originally the working title but ended up suiting the song so we stuck with it. Lyrically it&#8217;s revolved around a relationship that isn&#8217;t so sure of itself anymore &#8211; not wanting it to end, but maybe it should. Ted&#8217;s solo is played through a Leslie speaker, which we had a lot of fun playing around with, and Campbell played through a little ukulele bass with rubber strings, which has a really dead and thumpy sound. Chuck a little classic Hammond organ and piano stabs and, ba da bing, you&#8217;ve got a Tony Soprano of a track!</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Harder Than It Should Be?  </h2>
<p>One of the only songs from early album demos that made it onto the album &#8211; originally the song was a lot slower, and it was definitely a song we had almost given up on going into pre-production. We reworked the ending with Glenn [Tilbrook, producer], and in the end it turned out to be a really strong pop song.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158903689%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vWLpz&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Clementine?  </h2>
<p>One of the quickest songs we wrote on the album and also named after a type of tangerine (don&#8217;t get your hopes up, Clementines of the world ;) ). Ted brought the idea to rehearsal sometime last year and it immediately felt like a song that needed to be on the album. We added some extra things in the studio that really added to the vibe &#8211; Ted&#8217;s Omnichord got some good game-time and we even doubled the chorus parts with some vibraphone. It&#8217;s got a really strong swing feel to the song, and Dom has a bit of a croon during the verses. It&#8217;s also the first single off the album.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158903687%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-E75iO&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Unchained?  </h2>
<p>Ted had the opening chord sequence for the song, Dom sang some words and then the song explodes far away into a really nice place. We really liked the idea that the song didn&#8217;t need anything more than the start and the end, that once it had built up it didn&#8217;t need to change again. We really liked layering this song and it has a lot of depth, if you listen to what&#8217;s going with all the various instruments.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Daydreaming?  </h2>
<p>Written around the same time as ?Clementine?, this was another song we were really excited about. It&#8217;s written in an open tuning, which was interesting because it&#8217;s sort of like forgetting everything you know about guitar and starting all over again with a different sequence of notes. There&#8217;s quite a lot rhythmically going on, but it&#8217;s got a really great bouncy feel. The song is pretty much a collection of thoughts and a lot of questioning decisions about the future that a young guy might have, a.k.a. ?Have I fucked it??</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Allure?  </h2>
<p>One of the tracks we wrote back in Brisbane with our good friend Mike McAlary from <a href="/news/4561044">Gung Ho</a>. Another 3/4 ditty that immediately felt comfortable for us to play. This was our homage to clean chorus tone and has a delicious synth ascension in the chorus courtesy of <a href="/tv/4599579">Charles Murdoch</a>?s Prophet 8. It&#8217;s about temptation and the associated thoughts and feelings that go along with giving in. </p>

<p/>
<h2>?Agony &amp; Ecstasy?  </h2>
<p>We started jamming on this song literally days before we left for the UK and finished it in the studio. The first time we ran through the song in pre-production, Glenn stopped us and said we had the drum take. It may sound nothing like some of our older stuff, but the whole way through recording it definitely felt like a song we would write. We had a great time layering this song and even got to put the studio&#8217;s electric sitar guitar to use.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158903679%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TYI5O&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Bottleneck?  </h2>
<p>Another one of the last songs written for the album &#8211; it probably takes the cake for tugging at the heartstrings out of the all the tracks on the album. Following a long, drawn-out breakup of epic proportions, this is said someone&#8217;s ode to another said someone. We did the drum and bass take for this one with Mike in the middle of the day at a club in Brisbane called <a href="http://www.alhambralounge.com.au/">Alhambra</a>, and then finished the guitar and vocals at Campbell&#8217;s house. We were pretty surprised at how the DIY/pop-up studio came up against the tracks we did in the UK, and in the end it sounded sonically on par with the rest of the album, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Good Things Never Last?  </h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a demo from mid-2012 with this song on it. It kept coming back but we could never finish it and Ted, who wrote the majority of the track, wouldn&#8217;t let it die. We&#8217;re pretty glad it stuck around in the end. This one is a lot of fun to play, probably because it&#8217;s one of the most unique tracks on the album. The guitar is running through the Leslie again, which gave it that interdimensional, walking-through-a-field-of-sugarcane-underwater sound. It very nearly didn&#8217;t end up on the album but Glenn gave us confidence that it deserved to be there. It even features a gut-wrenching, edge-of-a-cliff, wind-in-your-hair guitar solo from Dom. We locked him in a bathroom with his amp on 11 until he came out with that six-phrase beast of an etude.</p>
