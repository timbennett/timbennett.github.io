<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Tokyo &#8211; Monday</h2>
<p/>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> Baba, as the district is affectionately known, is spiritual home of Osamu Tezuka, creator of Astro Boy, and fittingly the Astro Boy theme plays at the train station. Alex and I successfully found Tama Ryokan, but can I just say that seeing as we booked all the accommodation, I feel it is our god-given right to get terribly lost finding it. And I say that because later on I did get lost finding it. Failed to make a right at Starbucks. Roadcases and a few Ramps were involved this time. I wish to thank everyone for their patience. The landlady told us there is ?no crime? in Baba so neither the rooms nor the ryokan itself will be locked. She forgot that when four grown man-boys share a small space, there are many crimes.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016283/360x238-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Jon Tjhia, you snore<br/>
Subliminally it gives<br/>
Me nightmares! HEAD BAAAAG!</p>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> Her microscopically thorough tour included ?how not to touch the paper walls and doors? and ?how to work the TV remote?. I hadn&#8217;t used a TV remote in a while so I didn&#8217;t mind playing the game of demonstrating that I understand. But I honestly couldn&#8217;t imagine myself wanting to watch television in the next five days. Six days later Alex, Simon, Joe and I spent our last Saturday night in Tokyo in our hotel room in front of the box, thoroughly entertained by ice skating, gymnastics, crazy commercials and a terrible film (see Aleks? Saturday entry).</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Ryokan Lady!<br/>
You need to relax, alrightt?<br/>
We are not Slayer!</p>
<h2>#Shibuya O-Nest: The Velvet Teen, New Trust, Aleks and the Ramps</h2>
<p><strong>Aleks:</strong> Our first Tokyo show was with two American bands that play their rock music real emotional. I have no idea how we ended up on that bill, but they were all really great people and we had a mutual ?you guys are nice but I really don&#8217;t get/like your music? type of thing going on with them. The bar was sponsored by a terrible company that makes terrible cigarettes, so we got free packs of terrible cigarettes. This country rules.</p>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> We wished we&#8217;d brought more of the Ramps T-shirts in white. Apparently a choice between two colours, where one of them is white and the other mint green, was no choice at all. Even in a genuinely considerate culture like this one. No one loses face in Japan. Not even an unknown band playing on the sixth floor of a Tokyo venue to someone else&#8217;s crowd at 7.30pm on a Monday night. Hello packed room of enthusiastic Japanese people! Thanks for furnishing my heart with kittens and rainbows. Like you do everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
It becomes more clear<br/>
That this city was built with<br/>
Rainbows and kittens</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Tokyo &#8211; Tuesday to Thursday</h2>
<p/>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016289/448x335-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Aleks:</strong> We had a few days to be tourists in Tokyo, so we did the standard tourist things, like karaoke. I totally nailed ?Raspberry Beret? early on which gave me the gumption to attempt ?Say My Name?. Remembered midway through that I&#8217;d done it at karaoke before and it sucked because it&#8217;s too hard. Too many syllables. Them girls got talent. Simon almost ripped open a gateway to hell shrieking through ?Nothing Compares to You?.</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> I&#8217;d just like to take this opportunity to implore you, world: don&#8217;t even try &#8216;Bohemian Rhapsody&#8217;. It&#8217;s the <em>Everybody Loves Raymond of karaoke</em> &#8211; everybody knows it, but nobody can really get there.<br/>
I sang &#8216;Sometimes When We Touch&#8217;. It was a fitting tribute to our friends Juri, Mirai, Chiyo and Lily &#8211; with whom we spent some fine meals and jokes. &#8220;I wanna hold you &#8217;til you die,&#8221; I crooned, looking them each in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>Aleks:</strong> A misunderstanding over protocol in a host bar called ?dandy boy? got me in a scary situation with some Yakuza dudes. Joe coughed up some chicken cartilage while sitting in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen">onsen</a> and started choking. He ended up getting the Heimlich maneuver from the naked middle-aged man sitting next to him. Joe and Simon became models for a day and got paid to dress up as sailors; I don&#8217;t get picked because I&#8217;m clean shaven.</p>
<p>On the Yamanote line we saw a woman lose some serious face. Her head went all droopy when Joe remarked, ?Wow, she&#8217;s gonna blow chunks.?  ?Nah, she&#8217;s just tired, you know the work ethic here, blah blah, cultural stereotypes etc.&#8221; It was then that I noticed a little bit of foamy pre-puke dribbling out her mouth, followed by some powerful hurling, aimed nowhere in particular &#8211; just landing all over her pinstripe jacket/skirt combo and into her handbag. She stumbled off at the next stop and as the carriage filled up, people formed a little semi-circle around the pile of sick, while the more liquefied portion slowly crept down the floor towards us. Ewwww!</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016287/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Jon:</strong> I was lucky to be absent for the Ramps&#8217; encounter with J-Vom.  On one of our nights off, Alex and I played records at a new bar called The Legless Arms. During our days, we dragged ourselves through suburb after suburb on foot, eyes scraping past endless shopfronts. We went nuts buying socks from Uniqlo, and wrote new songs perched on the tatami of our ryokan. Otherwise, our sightseeing was relatively restricted. As the Ramps tour wound down in Tokyo, we were starting to get busier.</p>
<p>Having powwowed with director Takuji-san, we took the train to Asakusa one rainy morning to film an impromptu set for Sleepers Film &#8211; a sort of Saitama-based tribute to Takeaway Shows. After deliberating over various locations around the Senso-Ji temple, including Hanayashiki &#8211; a 19th century amusement park both sweet and unsettling &#8211; we shuffled into a tiny sushi restaurant with Takuji and Mina. A group of elderly ladies gruffly endured our short, quiet performance until trays of delicious food arrived, and I shut the lid of my computer.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3016288/640x424-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Way to go, fucking<br/>
Okonomiyaki! Use<br/>
Precious Haiku Word!</p>
<p><strong>Janita:</strong> After two days of sleep, I was ready for more life. We headed to Akihabara, the crazy electronics district: except electronics are not so much crazy as they are boring. Joe and I decided to stock up on trinkets to give to our loved ones back home. Did we buy some cute stuff? Did Joe really wee in his jeans? You know it.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016290/448x336-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We were so broke it was bordering on cruelty, but it did not stop us blowing a thousand yen on a skill tester (aka UFO Claw). Somehow we failed to snag a fluffy toy. One ice-cream sandwich from a vending machine later and Joe asked: ?Why is this country obsessed with so much meaningless shit?? We moved on to bourgeois Roppongi, eschewed a contemporary art exhibition, ate some sweet pumpkin-filled fish-shaped waffles and headed to a giant multi-level shop full of the most pointless crap imaginable. I waited outside for my brother, who was inside the store contemplating a novelty rubber-ducky vibrator. A nice bottle of hot green tea from a vending machine was all I needed right then. Of course there was one handy.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Dear Vending Machine<br/>
Reveal To Me All Of Your<br/>
Tasty Secrets Now</p>
<p>Oh yes, fish waffle<br/>
You&#8217;re a quiet suburb in<br/>
My city of snack</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Tokyo &#8211; Friday</h2>
<h2>#Shimokitazawa Three &amp; Basement Bar &#8211; HOLONEST: Aleks and the Ramps, 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties, FilFla, ii, oono yuuki, SoulTuneFactory, kooreruongaku, Tayutau </h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016291/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Janita:</strong> Our last show of the tour was in Shimokitazawa, rehearsal-studio-town and vintage clothing store mecca. I couldn&#8217;t go into any of the shops for fear of seeing something I couldn&#8217;t bear to leave behind. For that same reason, I don&#8217;t visit animal shelters. We focused our yen on one junk shop that restored all lost meaning to the word ?random?. None of us could afford the holy grail of random shit, which was so awesome I have composed a haiku:</p>
<p>Casio axe with tapedeck<br/>
O-genki Desu Ka?<br/>
Wakarimasen</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to be one of those people who are constantly pointing out how Japanese culture is better than ours but seriously, when you&#8217;re on a bill with six other bands, wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful to all arrive at 6.30pm, stand in a circle and be introduced to each other with ripples of polite applause? Standard practice in these parts! And it&#8217;s paradise on earth for all you forgetful ninny-hammerers out there, like myself. I asked the sound girl if there might be any guitar picks lying around and she returned with many! Pretty ones too! Kittens, rainbows, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> Ignoring their ill-advised name, SoulTuneFactory were a surprising electroacoustic treat. Casually, and without the kind of self-important overtones of many similar performances in Australia, they teased and processed rich sounds from armfuls of objects alongside guitars and bass. Kooreruongaku, seemingly populated by sweet, sparkle eyed teens, were a sort of warm Japanese facsimile of Sigur Ros. FilFla meanwhile performed stunningly crisp, entrancing electronic pop.   </p>

The highlight for me was a personal one: getting to play as second drummer for three songs with 4 Bonjour&#8217;s Parties. We&#8217;d grown close to everyone in the band, and playing alongside their drummer, Masashi, was a bittersweet way of saying ???. See you!</p>
<p><strong>Aleks:</strong> My bottle of water went AWOL before we went on, and I didn&#8217;t have the time to fetch another, so I did the show with some extreme parching going on. While singing, I got voice cracky bits like a 14-year-old. Plus I messed up heaps of non-voice things like playing guitar and hitting sampler pads. It was a show that was being filmed by multiple cameras and recorded, and there are tonnes of people there, so I was a little bummed that I sucked so much. Lost a heap of face.<br/>
We were filmed playing a song on the couch a few hours later, for Sleepers Film. Some of us stayed up drinking at an izakaya afterward, aiming to get the seedy first train, but we ended up piking around four.  </p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Sun sets on Tokyo<br/>

<h2>#Float &#8211; Sleeper Hallucination Camping: Darugaries, ii, s l o n n o n + Sonsen Gocha Bacco, Yoshihito Mizuuchi, Kaori Yoshikawa</h2>

<strong>Alex:</strong> ii departed Tokyo without their Rampy brethren, bound for Nishi-Kujo in Osaka: specifically, the monthly and for us much-anticipated &#8220;Sleeper Hallucination Camping&#8221; event. The venue was FLOAT &#8211; a small, dilapidated, two-story warehouse on the bank of (and sinking slightly into) the Aji-Gawa river. On arrival, our host Sugi &#8211; whom we&#8217;d already met when he came to our Kyoto show &#8211; excitedly showed us around, leading us to the roof for &#8220;absorbing atmosphere&#8221;. We also met resident three-legged kitten San-chan (who kept Jon up all night with ankle bites and other mischief). Later on Sugi played an amazing set under his &#8220;s l o n n o n&#8221; moniker, accompanied by live illustrator and friend Sonsen Gocha Bacco.</p>

<p>The SHC format had us pretty excited: performers/artists play to an otherwise empty room on FLOAT&#8217;s second floor while the crowd sits outside in the adjacent car park with beers, curries and head-sets connected to transistor radios. Audio is sent via fuzzy radio-wave to the audience&#8217;s earballs while scrambled visual art/footage is projected on to the face of the warehouse. On cooler evenings SHC provide the folks with sleeping bags, but it was a balmy night, even with the breeze coming off the water. Scooters occasionally motored past glowing vending machines, densely packed apartment blocks loomed large from across the river. Ambience! A genuinely unique context to experience music in. So rad.</p>

<p>Our one authentic taste of Kansai cuisine came in the early evening, from a sweet old takoyaki vendor who woke with a start from a nap and scrambled to his stereo to crank some classic 80s rock for our benefit. We rented bikes with the intention of exploring Nishi-Kujo, but my tires were kinda flat and most of our bike-time was spent walking them back and forth through the tunnel under the river. In the morning, hearts sighing after barely 18 hours amongst new friends in Osaka, we left the crew at FLOAT for the Shinkansen and our last show of the tour in Tokyo.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Tokyo &#8211; Sunday</h2>
<p/>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Brendan &#8211; an old friend of Alex&#8217;s with whom we have been hanging out in Tokyo &#8211;  had a slightly unusual proposition for Aleks, Joe and myself. How would we like to do a bit of (paid!) modelling for a friend&#8217;s fashion label on the weekend? I didn&#8217;t know it was possible for my ego to get any bigger, but I guess it was. ?Totally! Plus, I&#8217;m broke!? I replied. Brendan took pictures on his phone and sent them to the label there and then.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we got word that the shoot was on, but they only wanted Joe and I, as Aleks did not have a beard. ?The one fucking time I decide to shave!? was his response.</p>
<p>Come Sunday, Joe and I dragged our sorry arses out of bed and hot-footed it to Shibuya to be professionally handsome for a day. We met Brendan, got some shitty greasy food to perk us up, and headed to the gallery/studio where the shoot was to take place.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016300/335x448-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It was a total blast, getting our hairs and make-up done, dressing up in cool maritime-inspired clothes and striking a pose. I had to hold a dead fish. Joe smoked a pipe. Dudes helped us dress, adjusted clothes and generally made us feel important. It was surprisingly hard work, and we both developed a small shred of sympathy for professional models. But it disappeared quickly. Joe&#8217;s hungover state was not aided by the extremely strong tobacco in the pipe, and within minutes he began to sway, appearing ready to blow chunks. The photographer noticed this and quickly exclaimed, ?Its okay! We have it!? So Joe earns a little rest. He really looked like shit. It was damn funny. We got out of there quick, took our cash and headed straight for tonkatsu &#8211; breaded, fried pork being as good a hangover cure as any. </p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>
Harajuku girls<br/>
You guys are really random!<br/>
And heaps funky!</p>
<h2>#Gamuso &#8211; Farm Party #4: ii, OPQ, Moon Face Boys, Henna Dress</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016296/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Jon:</strong> Tokyo was pouring with rain as we prepared to farewell it, dragging our heavy equipment through the modest laneways of Asagaya on the way to our final show.  Through early bands (the endearingly slipshod pop mysticism of Moon Face Boys &#8211; Kei from My Pal Foot Foot &#8211; and disturbed atonal chiptune of Henna Dress), we feared nobody would come. The bar downstairs was quiet, and the band room lined with a handful of people. Half the bands had played, and Alex was upstairs taking a disco nap.</p>
<p>OPQ &#8211; Suzaki and Aritanbo &#8211; had earlier played a song or two with Moon Face Boys. When he introduced himself to us, Suzaki explained that many foreigners had trouble distinguishing his name from ?Suzuki?, and that he sometimes made them call him Zak &#8211; &#8220;Like Zakk Wylde!&#8221;, he laughed, swinging an invisible guitar high into the air. An improvising duo, OPQ were one of the most thrilling things we heard all tour: trilling, creaking home electronics (modified by Suzaki) circling a bed of crushed-up melody. They were something to watch, too, occasionally dipping or dropping objects into an internally-lit glass bowl fitted with a hydrophone. We scrambled to buy their tapes afterward.</p>
<p>While OPQ played, people finally started to arrive. Not just people &#8211; friends. Juri, Chiyo, Mirai, Koji, Brendan, Dai-chan, Tomomi, with whom we&#8217;d been spending time. My friends Ben, Kim and Brad from Australia, all in Tokyo for research projects. And a handful of friends I hadn&#8217;t seen for years &#8211; Paul, Miyuki, Daisuke and Jane. It was Paul&#8217;s birthday that night, and somehow Joe and Janita learned that their grandpa taught Paul fishing when he was 10.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed. Alex and I played with a smile, bathed in science fiction video. I grinned as I observed, from the corner of my eye, people dancing in front of me. Afterward, Joe and Janita helmed the PA and stirred up a massively silly dancefloor. I spent so much money excitedly buying drinks for people.</p>
<p>It kept raining. It poured as we reluctantly acknowledged that we all had trains to catch, and as we dashed through the lanes with our equipment, swinging bags up staircases and escalators to the platform.  We heard its steady patter as we gave our newest friends the most hurried of goodbyes, soon, we hoped to be replaced by hello-agains.  When we emerged at Ikebukuro Station, the rain had slowed to a falling mist beading on our hair and shoulders, so few hours away from the dry tarmac of home.</p>
