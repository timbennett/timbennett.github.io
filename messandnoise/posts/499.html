                <h3>In the lead-up to next week&#8217;s BIGSOUND industry talkfest in Brisbane,&#8217;M+N&#8217; talks to executive programmer Graham ?Asho? Ashton about his picks for the three-day event. BIGSOUND photos by <strong>JUSTIN EDWARDS</strong>.

<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014001/300x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
After leaving school to join a punk band, Graham ?Asho? Ashton has spent the best part of two decades working at independent and major records labels in Brisbane and Sydney, before starting up music management company Footstomp earlier this year. </p>
<p>A delegate at the last four BIGSOUND conferences, Ashton took on the role executive programmer in 2010. He&#8217;s helped secure the likes of Ed Kuepper, Robert Forster, Michael Gudinski, John O&#8217;Donnell and US author Michael Azerrad, whose book <em>Our Band Could Be Your Like</em> sparked his life-long dedication to music.</p>
<p>Modeled on overseas behemoths like South by Southwest, BIGSOUND is a three-day industry conference featuring some 90 speakers and more than 25 panels spread out across the Fortitude Valley from September 8-10. Its live component will feature 60 acts including <a href="/news/4052107">festival smackdown queen</a> Washington, as well as Children Collide, The Gin Club, The John Steel Singers, Parades, Ernest Ellis, Bridezilla and Hungry Kids Of Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>Why&#8217;d you decide to get on board this year?</strong><br/>
I had been doing some workshops with Q Music and got to know the team over the past few years. One of the guys told me that it was a two-year tenure and it was up for grabs and I thought I would have a crack.</p>
<p><strong>What were your impressions of last year&#8217;s event?</strong><br/>
I had attended the last four years as a delegate/punter and noticed the growth each year. Particularly last year. I walked out with a real sense of pride that I was a part of the Brisbane music community.  </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s does the executive programmer do?</strong><br/>
I am part of a team that work on selecting and inviting the speakers for the conference and the artists for the showcase programs.</p>
<p><strong>Was there anything in particular you were looking for when selecting the speakers?</strong><br/>
Relevance and inspiration are the key words.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve got two Brisbane legends in Robert Forster and Ed Kuepper on board. Was that a difficult coup to pull off?</strong><br/>
It is never easy to persuade people that are in demand to be part of something like this. We are absolutely chuffed to have two of the most important songwriters to come out of Brisbane to play significant roles in the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any speakers you particularly wanted but &#8211; for whatever reason &#8211; couldn&#8217;t get?</strong><br/>
Absolutely! The main reasons are usually logistical and they are all on my hit list for 2011.</p>
<p><img class="c" data-src="/images/3013998/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3014000/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/></p>
<p><strong>Was it hard convincing some of the international speakers to make the trek to Brisbane, which isn&#8217;t as synonymous with the music biz as Melbourne or Sydney?</strong><br/>
Not at all. I think that mindset is a thing of the past. Particularly from an international point of view. Bands like The Saints, The Go-Betweens and Powderfinger have well and truly stamped Brisbane on the international map musically.</p>
<p><strong>Any speakers you&#8217;re particularly excited about?</strong><br/>
I must say, Michael Azerrad. When I was in my late teens a mate of mine gave me a compilation tape of American hardcore bands like H&#8217;sker D?, Bad Brains, Minutemen etc. These artists were part of the scene that made up his book, <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life</em>. That tape and later that book was the catalyst for me dedicating my life to music. That&#8217;s from a personal standpoint. Professionally, I wish I could split myself into three so that I could attend all of the panels. </p>
<p><strong>Everett True told us that Azerrad refuses to appear at any event involving him. Is this true?</strong><br/>
No.</p>
<p><strong>What will Azerrad be talking about?</strong><br/>
The modern relevance of DIY.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3013999/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve seen a proliferation of industry talkfests over the years. What distinguishes BIGSOUND?</strong><br/>
The very nature of these events is that they will have some kind of similarity. I go back to the word relevance again. I would like to think that the lions share of our international delegates are the next legends of the global music community.</p>
<p><strong>Is it modeled on something like South by Southwest?</strong><br/>
SxSW is certainly an inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of audience are you expecting?</strong><br/>
It will be a real gathering of the tribe for the Australian music community. I don&#8217;t know of many key players that won&#8217;t be attending. I also see the number of aspiring artists, music industry pundits growing each year.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of your panel picks? And what bands are you looking forward to seeing at BIGSOUND Live?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a very strange relationship that the programmer has with both the conference and showcasing programs. I know it sounds naff, but picking panels or showcasing artists is a little like choosing between my children.</p>

<p>BIGSOUND will be held over three days (September 8-10) in Brisbane&#8217;s Fortitude Valley. The event is sold out, but tickets are still available for BIGSOUND Live. For more information click <a href="http://www.qmusic.com.au/bigsound/2010/">here</a>.</p>
