                <h3>After the disappointing down-tempo &#8216;Some People Have Real Problems&#8217;, Adelaide&#8217;s Sia Furler returns with an album that showcases her pop credentials, writes <strong>DOM ALESSIO</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3012482/875x868-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="440"/><br/>
There are many elements that make Sia Furler an unlikely pop star: up until this point, none of her records have contained an overly-commercial sound; she doesn&#8217;t possess model-esque looks; and she&#8217;s from Adelaide. But it&#8217;s precisely this ?Girl Next Door? appeal that makes Sia the perfect pop star. In interviews she comes across free of pretention; a natural-born raconteur with a penchant for the quirky and wry. She&#8217;s the girl everyone wants to be BFFs with.</p>
<p>But her effervescent personality had lain predominately dormant over her past two releases: <em>2004?s Colour The Small One* and its follow-up, *Some People Have Real Problems*. It wasn&#8217;t an issue with the former because it was a ridiculously sublime record, layered to the hilt with gorgeous melodies and luscious textures. *Some People Have Real Problems</em>, by contrast, never peaked like its predecessor did. There were too many songs that sounded like discarded Zero 7 tunes, the downtempo UK electronica act Sia joined after immigrating to England in the early Noughties.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve subsequently learned during Sia&#8217;s latest interviews promoting <em>We Are Born* that it was, in fact, this record that was supposed to proceed *Colour The Small One*. Her record label at the time, Universal, thought it would be career suicide to release an up-tempo dance album, considering she&#8217;d just found an international audience with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ghPcYqn0p4Y">?Breathe Me?</a>, a hauntingly intimate tune that soundtracked the final scene of *Six Feet Under</em>. </p>
<p>Maybe the planets have aligned correctly now, or maybe she&#8217;s just on a new record label, because <em>We Are Born</em> has finally seen the light of day, almost four years after she started work on it with Greg Kurstin, one half of synth-pop darlings The Bird And The Bee and a man who&#8217;s worked with pop juggernauts (Kylie, Ke$ha, Lily Allen), indie royalty (The Flaming Lips, Peaches) and bands we&#8217;d rather forget (Geggy Tah).</p>
<blockquote><p>?She&#8217;s a wonderful singer who&#8217;s been channelling Billie Holliday and Etta James since Amy Winehouse and Duffy were in high school.?</p></blockquote>
<p><em>We Are Born* is Sia&#8217;s most overtly positive record to date, mainly inspired by her relationship with Le Tigre&#8217;s J.D. Samson. It manifests itself in music that yokes mainstream pop melodies, disco tempos and glossy synth-pop patinas. Starting with children&#8217;s voices singing the album&#8217;s title, Sia invites you to reclaim the abandonment of youth. The album&#8217;s opening line, ?We are born/Without a care,? is as much a statement of intent as it is an introductory message. The arrangements on *We Are Born</em> are largely unfettered. The grandiose string sections and tinkling accoutrements have been discarded in favour of a more economic lineup; guitar or keyboard takes the lead melody, anchored by an insistent rhythm section. It&#8217;s all the name of immediacy, the trademark of a good pop song. </p>
<p>In this respect, <em>We Are Born* is a winner. If you take Sia&#8217;s advice and listen to her new album ?without a care?, it&#8217;s a very easy album to like. But unlike some of her previous material, the album is destined to have a short shelf-life. What Sia did so beautifully in the past was focus on the minutiae of everyday situations (?Sweet Potato? from *Colour The Small One* or ?Little Black Sandles? off *Some People Have Real Problems*). On *We Are Born*, she recycles ideas and observations that have been applied by songwriters ad nauseam. ?Clap Your Hands? comes across as a simulacrum of a pop song, with contrite lyrics like ?Clap your hands/Turn the lights on my nights this is life/And we only get one chance.? We&#8217;ve heard this kind of ?party like it&#8217;s your last night? bunkum before. In fact, the first four tracks off *We Are Born</em> are pretty much interchangeable. They adhere to the same formula and almost the same tempo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not until you get to the business end of the record that you find its stronger songs, and evidence of Sia&#8217;s excellent songwriting abilities. On ?Hurting Me Now?, she juxtaposes sparkling instrumentation with lyrics about feeling underappreciated. ?The Co-Dependent? benefits from a fantastic wandering bass line that dances around the hand-claps and busy percussion that constitutes the rhythm section. Sia&#8217;s got a proven track record of writing down-tempo numbers, so unsurprisingly these showcase her strengths, especially vocally. She&#8217;s a wonderful singer who&#8217;s been channelling Billie Holliday and Etta James since Amy Winehouse and Duffy were in high school. Songs like ?I&#8217;m In Here? and ?Be Good To Me? demonstrate how Sia picks the odd notes in a musical scale, which piques your interest because it&#8217;s not what your brain expects to hear. I just wish she&#8217;d done this on her more unabashed dance-pop numbers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>We Are Born</em> is a sugar rush record: it&#8217;ll put you on a high during the moment, but the effect wears off minutes later. If the rumours are true, and this is going to be Sia&#8217;s final album, it&#8217;ll be a shame because she&#8217;s undoubtedly a talented songwriter who&#8217;s still learning a new idiom. Even if this album misses the mark on occasion, the music world needs a pop star like Sia. She&#8217;s real, and that&#8217;s more than you can say about most of her contemporaries these days.</p>
