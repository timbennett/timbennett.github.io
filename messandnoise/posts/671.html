                <h3>Are indie clips slowly reclaiming Video Hits? legacy of thrusts and oral fixations? Words by <strong>JUSTIN HEAZLEWOOD<em>*. Illustrations by *</em>LEIGH RIGOZZI</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022859/448x326-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
As <em>Video Hits</em> aired its <a href="/news/4289776">final episode</a> this month, I asked myself &#8211; how will our children learn about sex? Primary school assemblies won&#8217;t be the same without a generation of tweens emulating Rhianna&#8217;s pelvic thrusts and singing, ?Sex in the air I don&#8217;t care/I love the smell of it.? How will young boys find black misogynists to aspire to, so they can learn about ?honeyz in the club? and that it&#8217;s OK to wear sunglasses inside? </p>
<p>Advertising is about catching folks with their guard down, and every Saturday morning it was a massacre. The dowdy crowd, armed with pyjamas and cereal, were probed by strobes, sprayed with hot-synth and force fed Freudian imagery by a slick snake with a gold megaphone. Cameras spread the legs of feminism, milking an obsession with the female form &#8211; oiled like a lamb roll and tied up with bikini string.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d reminisce to 1989, a time when pop songs went for five minutes and singers like Madonna were decently dressed. One of my first sexual encounters is attributed to ?Like A Prayer?. For a 10-year-old, the song was like being allowed inside an adult dream. It was all so solemn and dramatic. There&#8217;s a sexual tension that permeates the track, from the suppressed gospel harmonies to the brooding organ. ?Like a Prayer? is the soundtrack for Catholics lost in their lust and little boys ready to add emotional layers like Lego.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cSVbwwsLPqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Somewhere in my robust child psyche I processed the scenes of Madonna, wide of eye and heavy of bosom, kneeling before a wax black Christ. In between ?Kokomo? and ?The Right Stuff,? the song was a conceptual baptism, finding its power through sex as metaphor. The lyrics struck a duality between religious and sexual meaning, as one writer described it &#8220;a mix of the sacred and the profane?. Exploring a psycho-sexual relationship with a black Jesus figure strikes me as more outrageous than anything Madonna&#8217;s successors have done. </p>
<p>Two years later Prince would deliver ?Cream?. I was eleven at the time, an age where my friend would lie on top of me on my trampoline, and water damaged porn mags would turn up on bushwalks. As a music video, ?Cream? is European soft-core dinner theatre, at odds with today&#8217;s skittish editing and cold CGI backdrops. In what is typical of the era, the stage exhibits a live band seething with choreography. One of the most striking features is the use of guitar as phallus, Prince treating it as an extension of his body. In this diorama of the male Id, it&#8217;s a hedonists paradise where politics is dissolved in sweat. Skinny girls dance while a portly woman sings; men get on top as lasses go down; two Latinos per Prince. In its defence, ?Cream? brings colour and life to eroticism, the carnal images in sync with the carnival guitar and parlour organ.</p>

<p/>
<p>Girlfriends have said Prince used to terrify them. They couldn&#8217;t quite understand what he was. The chest hair, spidery legs and purple suits &#8211; for children he was a kind of fun scary clown; a beguiling villain, so charismatic you couldn&#8217;t help being drawn into his fluro orgy. Prince&#8217;s last number one would be lucky to survive today, the BPMs too slow for radio or clubs. As a mood brushstroke it&#8217;s perfect &#8211;  there&#8217;s a soft lensed shuffle that slinks into your subconscious like sensory sub-bass.</p>
<p>The same year, 1991, The Divinyls set Australia on fire with ?I Touch Myself?. I remember <em>Hey Hey It&#8217;s Saturday</em> banning the title, Molly Meldrum referring to it as ?I touch??. In a bed of deceptively breezy soft-rock, Chrissie Amphlett slathered female masturbation in the nooks and crannies of the mainstream market. While Nick Cave may have topped her in shock value, he couldn&#8217;t match the feat of dragging such a controversial song to number one in conservative Australia. I remember mulling the song over in my head, imagining a woman&#8217;s fingers moving down to where a blank space was, like a section of a computer game not yet unlocked.</p>

<p>Recently my friend sent me a (NSFW) link to ?Bombay? by Spanish artist El Guincho. At the time I was freshly single and stable as a wet tissue. I watched the video, a cataclysmically evocative and sexually idiosyncratic tour de farce, depicting full frontal juxtapositions, psycho-sexual metaphors, porn-culture satires and a stylishly twisted summation of the sexual clich&#8217;s media has punched into our subconscious. A clean look at our dirty minds.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>I remember high school games where you&#8217;d realise how easy it was to make things sexual. ?I&#8217;m sucking my wet juice from this long, hard straw.? Porn talk comes so easily, it&#8217;s a currency that&#8217;s laced in our language like a magnetic strip. Beneath our defensively sophisticated faeade we are carnally designed and lousy with hormones. This is something advertising exploits. </p>
<p>The fast food sign is red.<br/>
I am salivating.<br/>
I want to put things in my mouth.<br/>
A girl is near-naked.<br/>
Where I can buy the deodorant?</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022860/434x336-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I watched ?Bombay,? groin buzzing and heart racing &#8211; anxious and titillated. The director had juxtaposed porn culture with the indie aesthetic, dealing it a Michel Gondry/Wes Anderson dose of Pomo finesse. It was a bombastic mash. Porn, once VHS dodgy, had ridden the online wave to infiltrate our culture, happy to have its dark underbelly masked in ironic appreciation; while indie, a crochet of gleamed nostalgia and cutesy aloofness, was yet to assert an overtly sexual side. ?Bombay? may have marked a retro-sexual revolution &#8211; half a century on and girls were once again ditching their vintage ?50s dresses for a ?60s mini.</p>
<p>While the results were stunning, I wasn&#8217;t able to enjoy it at the time. It just made me sad. I felt like the lame boy in the Pied Piper story, left behind as the gates closed on the magical kingdom. As an advertisement, ?Bombay? was flogging a hamburger to someone recovering from food poisoning. I was a relationship dropout, now being teased by an electro-relevant musician and his hipster-cool art clip, full of glamorous beauties that I couldn&#8217;t even speak to in fantasy French. A combination of Catholic guilt, rural prudishness, porn damage and over-sensitivity left me once again world-weary and defenceless, forced to absorb someone else&#8217;s idea about sex, out of context and alone. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Neil Hamburger joke:<br/>
Q. Why is Britney Spears so popular?<br/>
A. Because everybody&#8217;s horny and depressed.</p>
<p>During the zeroes, the commercial pop booty corps marched onwards, cocks and knockers at the ready, while indie music retreated up into the clouds. Balladesses donned the flowing silks of British-folk, while Dylan-heads hid in flannies and beards, feisty as chamomile. The indie genre can be defined by its apolitical lyricism, Pro Tools polish, pseudo-tribal obsession with animals and a regression to innocence via storybook nostalgia. Indie was a generational swing against the crassly anti-establishment ?90s and sexually provocative alternatives like Hole, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Machine Gun Fellatio. Coupled with the post 9-11 climate being ?too real?, it seems logical for Gen-Y to escape to an idealised ?80s via ?60s dreamland. While commercial pop was a shotgun of fishing hooks, indie was soft as river mud &#8211; dangerously low on visual or audio handholds. </p>
<p>This year there&#8217;s a been a run of provocative videos, suggesting that small-label songsters may be coming out of their closets. In Gotye&#8217;s ?Somebody That I Used To Know? the camera pans up his bare body, intricately patterned with tribal paint. In Canadian band Stars ?Changes? a girl finds herself naked in an empty theatre, and after growing a tail, embarks on a feisty dance monologue. Amanda Palmer&#8217;s ferociously feminist ?Map Of Tasmania? dares girls not to shave their squished mittens, while JJJ Unearthed band San Cisco&#8217;s ?Girls Do Cry? is two minutes of lasses in lingerie nibbling Dinkum Dogs and wiggling their bums at the camera. (The footage doubles as an ad on the director&#8217;s lingerie company website.)</p>

<p/>
<p>In 2010 Washington cut through the pack of Kate Bush-rangers to bring some ?Madonna Monroe? back to the Australian music video. In ?Sunday Best? she set hearts racing with a sassy appropriation of the iconic dance scene from Jean Luc Godard&#8217;s <em>Bande&#8217;s A Part</em>. In the French original, the routine is a metaphor for the dichotomy of youth, outwardly cool yet inwardly frenzied &#8211; each character fretting over what the other thinks of their body. Washington on the other hand is a model of extroversion, carrying herself (and being carried) with a confidence bordering on brash in the context of her peers.  </p>

<p>?I start shaking when you shake it/Holy shit, you sure can turn it on<br/>
Do you, do you, do you know/What&#8217;s in my head when I&#8217;m below you?? With lyrics as salacious as her video, Washington is part of a wave of artists defining a new sexuality &#8211; injecting it with a sense of style and playfulness. The legs are out, but they&#8217;re too busy dancing to be splayed around a pole. The performer is shown smiling &#8211; a friendly flag amid the dazzle and grind. It&#8217;s a welcome reminder that looking hot can be fun; not just a self-important expression of power. The overblown starlets of <em>Video Hits</em>, just like the grimacing aggressors of porn, are rarely pictures of ease.   </p>
<blockquote><p>?While commercial pop was a shotgun of fishing hooks, indie was soft as river mud &#8211; dangerously low on visual or audio handholds.?</p></blockquote>
<p>I once received a lap dance at a friends bucks night. It remains to this day one of the least sexy things I&#8217;ve done. As I sat there, frozen and bemused, watching the girl go through her paces, a familiarity came over me. I&#8217;d been in this situation before &#8211; on my couch at home eating pancakes, micro-seduced by a conveyer belt of divas. With the strip club addition of noxious perfume, I was reminded how far away from sex I really was. </p>
<p><em>Video Hits</em> will leave behind a legacy of over compression. From the music, crushed into a hot, sharp nugget; to the lyrics, tightly packed with cliches, to the videos, shaved smooth and cold pressed of coarseness. The most compressed thing of all is the idea of sex &#8211; reduced to a series of thrusts and oral fixations &#8211; a lowest common denominator digested by adolescents. Between pop music, porn and religion they&#8217;re in for a cocktail of confusion it can take decades to sober from. Somewhere amid the smoke and carnage of the raunch culture assault, we should, in the words of The Shamen, draw on ?Love Sex Intelligence? (coming on like a seventh sense) to remember we are authentically sensual beings, who shouldn&#8217;t have to suppress ourselves to off-set the corruption of others.</p>
