                <h3>From the desk of <strong>EVERETT TRUE</strong> comes his idiosyncratic take on seven Brisbane bands, supplied Russian-roulette-style by his editor. As ever, the man&#8217;s opinions are his own and don&#8217;t reflect those of &#8211; well, anyone else in the universe.
</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve spent all today listening to ?legendary? (i.e. so obscure that even Steve Malkmus would struggle to identify this dissonant beauty) NZ (since relocated to Sydney) band The Garbage &amp; The Flowers on Brisbane&#8217;s ace alt. alt. (? Everett True, 2013) radio station <a href="https://soundcloud.com/livedelay/episode-35-dz-deathrays-the">4ZZZ</a>. A band that blacklisted rock writer Scott Creney recently <a href="http://www.collapseboard.com/reviews/albums-reviews/the-garbage-the-flowers-eyes-rind-as-if-beggars-fire/">memorably described</a> as demonstrating that ?there is no discernible difference between ?All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties? and <em>Metal Machine Music</em>. Not really. Not if you understand the ways of the universe, if you place your ear up against nature from a certain precise angle.?</p>
<p>This preface is just by way of pointing the fuck out that we folk up here in Brisbane sometimes know what the fuck we&#8217;re on about. (See also this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/livedelay/episode-33-scraps-screaming">blistering set</a>.) This being Brisbane however &#8211; a town smaller than Tony Abbott&#8217;s portfolio of women &#8211; I feel I should throw in a disclaimer. I have knowingly played on stage with members of at least two of the following acts (picked for me by <em>Mess + Noise</em>). But you can best believe it ain&#8217;t those grinning gurning cheepy cheepy cheepy triple j-lovin? jackanapes in Hey Geronimo. Chirpy bastards.</p>
<p>Q: Why are there so many instrumental bands in Brisbane?<br/>
A: Because John Steel Singers.</p>

<h2>Sky Needle  </h2>
<p>The moment Sky Needle&#8217;s second album <em><a href="http://skyneedle.bandcamp.com/album/debased-shapes-lp">Debased Shapes</a></em> starts, it immediately becomes your new favourite album ever (FUCK The Garbage &amp; The Flowers! No disrespect intended). Woozy and disorientating and groovesome (that&#8217;s some groove!) and friendly like that nicotine-reeking grandma plonked down next to you on the 385, array of plastic bags and all. Most of their instruments don&#8217;t have names, because most of their instruments didn&#8217;t exist until yesterday: percussion clatters like possums being stoned off a tin roof by eight-year-olds, strange little farting and squelching noises tap out crescendos like a battery farm of Spacemen 3 fans blowing up water balloons, a female vocal whispers and quacks and promises strange magic indeed &#8230; all this is to the GOOD, you understand. </p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> Two. Joel Stern (leghorn, electronics), Sarah Byrne (voice percussion &#8211; you see what I did there? I deliberately left the comma out).<br/>
<strong>Members in total fucking godhead awe of, and who haven&#8217;t bothered playing on stage with me since:</strong> Two. Joel Stern and Sarah Byrne.<br/>
<strong>Members in total jealous funk at:</strong> Four.<br/>
<strong>Running score at the doors:</strong> Brisbane 4 Melbourne 0.</p>

<h2>Andrew Tuttle  </h2>
<p>The description on Tuttle&#8217;s <a href="http://andrewtuttle.bandcamp.com/album/brisbane-rezoned">Bandcamp</a> is so all-encompassing, I don&#8217;t see much point in paraphrasing it (the lazy critic&#8217;s time-honoured tool). One commentator suggested that Andrew Tuttle creates ?music that is at peace with its surroundings.? The original of ?Brisbane? is a slightly frantic, looped synthetic banjo piece &#8211; um, that makes it sound dull or lacking: far from it. This is illumination. And the remixes are more in keeping with Tuttle&#8217;s sound art&#8230; </p>
<p>Although how the fuck anyone has the gall to describe Heinz Riegler&#8217;s <a href="http://andrewtuttle.bandcamp.com/track/brisbane-heinz-riegler-nervous-remix">?Nervous? remix</a> as hinting at ?the eerie quiet of a late-night walk or peak-hour drive in the inner suburbs? when it&#8217;s a jittery paranoid buzz of sound, I have no idea. And the ?beautiful subtropical core? that is supposed to be at the heart of the Pale Earth <a href="http://andrewtuttle.bandcamp.com/track/brisbane-pale-earth-cloudland-dance-hall-remix">?Cloudland Dance Hall? remix</a> (under ?a processed, claustrophobic and dystopian future?) &#8230; in the old days this would&#8217;ve been called ?noodling? and filed next to garlic roasts.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://andrewtuttle.bandcamp.com/track/brisbane-bong-yza-remix">Bong YZA mix</a>, meanwhile, is as irritating-bad-hipster-hair as it sounds. </p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> None. I don&#8217;t do laptop.<br/>
<strong>Associated collaborators knowingly shared bills with:</strong> Several. This is Brisbane.<br/>
<strong>Running scores at the doors:</strong> Brisbane 0 Sydney 0.</p>

<h2>Cannon  </h2>
<p>Overwrought garage pop/pub rock &#8211; not a combination I&#8217;d willingly recommend, despite The White Stripes. Half of Brisbane has this horrendous Smashing Pumpkins factor to its love for alt. rock and this can manifest itself in the strangest of ways. Minus point for the flippant title ?It&#8217;s Cool, No Worries?. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re diamond geezers and a wicked good laugh live &#8230; but I&#8217;m not watching a fucking concert, am I? There&#8217;s very little to say here &#8211; I mean (<em>sighs*) fuckinggoodonyaforgettinguponstageandhavingago &#8211; so here&#8217;s a Nick Cave anecdote (first published on my student blog *<a href="http://www.collapseboard.com/everett-true/three-reasons-why-nick-cave-should-ask-everett-trues-band-to-support-the-bad-seeds-on-their-forthcoming-tour-of-australia/">Music That I Like</a></em>):</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s ATP, January ?09. Thursday evening barbecue, Nick Cave&#8217;s son is on the prowl with his new autograph book, aided by dad. ?Hey, look, here&#8217;s Everett!? dad announces. ?He&#8217;s really famous. Ask him!? So his son proffers me the book &#8211; Nick takes me to one side, fixes me with a steely glare. ?Now, no pornographic poetry please, Everett. His mum doesn&#8217;t want any swear words.? I think for a second, then scrawl, ?No wukkas &#8211; Everett True.? The boy wants to know what it means, so Nick has a shifty. ?No fucking worries &#8211; nice one,? he laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> None. Far as I know.<br/>
<strong>Recording engineer knowingly shared bills with:</strong> One. Donovan Miller.<br/>
<strong>Running scores at the door (grudgingly):</strong> Brisbane 0 Sydney 2.</p>

<h2>Skinny Jean  </h2>
<p>Oh God. Please. Make. It. Stop. I have no point of reference for this. Out my window, a QUT student covers band plays through a cabaret version of ?Blurred Lines? for the 50th time &#8230; compared to the irredeemably overstated Brisbane five-piece Skinny Jean&#8217;s second album <em><a href="http://skinny-jean.bandcamp.com/album/the-diving-saucer-returns-from-a-world-where-the-sun-never-shines">The Diving Saucer Returns from a World Where the Sun Never Shines</a></em>, this is Nina Simone covering ?Strange Fruit?.</p>
<p>If one was feeling kind, one could call it ?theatrical?. I&#8217;m not feeling kind. I&#8217;ve heard it. If one was feeling generous, one could refer to its ?wilful musicianship? or ?errant pretentiousness?. I&#8217;m not feeling generous. I&#8217;ve heard it. If one was feeling descriptive, one could mention its rapid time and melody and key changes and (presumably) playful post-prog-rock leanings and disjointed songwriting tendencies. I AM NOT FEELING FUCKING DESCRIPTIVE! I HAVE HEARD THIS FUCKING STEAMING PILE OF PRETENTIOUS POSSUM&#8217;S KIDNEYS. Skinny Jean: more irritating than a five-mile-high billboard of Tony Abbott&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> Fuck off.<br/>
<strong>Associated collaborators knowingly shared bills with:</strong> Fuck off. And don&#8217;t go contacting me after this appears to set me right, either: I&#8217;ve disowned family members for far less.<br/>

<h2>Hey Geronimo  </h2>
<p>Oh God. Imagine if Richard Kingsmill actually decided what Music Should Sound Like. This sort of bouncy-bouncy, look-at-us-we&#8217;re-so-cute-mum-we&#8217;re-in-a-band, featureless, colourless, shapeless, shiftless indie rock was out of fashion five years ago &#8230; and it was out of fashion even then. One day all music will sound like this and I WILL BE DEAD, GLEEFULLY TURNING IN MY GRAVE BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE TO FUCKING LISTEN TO IT. I once saw The Flying Burrito Brothers play The Corner Hotel with no original members: this is like hearing John Steel Singers perform a similar feat. There really is a website called ?Indie Music Nation? isn&#8217;t there? </p>
<p>The covers band outside has now switched to sounding like a pale version of Kimbra &#8211; who&#8217;s a pale version of any other numbers of pale versions herself. I&#8217;m thinking of rushing out and embracing them to my heaving bosom. Anything, rather than inflict such radio-orientated pap on myself again. And I <em>like</em> Bleeding Knees Club.</p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> None. And hopefully never will.<br/>
<strong>Associated sympathisers knowingly shared bills with:</strong> At least one. But he was dressed in a giant cockroach suit.<br/>

<h2>Archdukes  </h2>
<p>On the <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com.au/Archdukes">triple j Unearthed</a> website &#8211; and if you want one solid reason why so much of Australian ?indie? music is such derivative featureless pap right now, there it is sister &#8211; this southeast Queensland quartet list their influences as ?The Jesus And Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine and The Stone Roses.? The burning question: So what do they actually <a href="https://soundcloud.com/archdukes">sound like</a>?</p>
<p>They sound <em>Swervedriver bad</em>. Let&#8217;s not mention them ever again. </p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> None. They like bad Britpop and third-rate shoegaze. I like Young Marble Giants and Nina Simone. And never the twain will meet.<br/>
<strong>Members in total fucking godhead awe of:</strong> None. I wasn&#8217;t even in awe of Kevin Shields &#8211; let alone Mark Gardener &#8211; the first time round. And don&#8217;t get me started on the Reid brothers&#8230;<br/>

<h2>Primitive Motion  </h2>
<p>The record company (<a href="http://bedroomsuckrecords.com/shop/primitive-motion-worlds-floating-by-lp/">Bedroom Suck</a>) describe Primitive Motion as:<br/>
?The lovely finger-paint scrawl of Brisbane residents Leighton Craig and Sandra Selig. Together they conjure repetitive waves of dream/float pop using an array of cheap keyboards and machine-made beats woven with echo-drenched vocals, brass, wind instruments and off-kilter drumming. The music of Primitive Motion is suspended in time at the blissful confluence of komische Krautrock and post-punk DIY. Reset your clocks to Primitive Motion.?</p>
<p>For once, the record company is spot on.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote about a <a href="http://www.collapseboard.com/everett-true/song-of-the-day/song-of-the-day-565-primitive-motion/">previous single</a> [?Interior Sea?]. I see no reason to change my mind now:<br/>
<em>Immolation and insulation and isolation and imagination. The opposite of sex. Serious music for serious people. ?Distant disembodied harmony seeks out distant disembodied harmony for long-term relationship.? Music to play for when you need to calm down. None of these are slights.</em></p>
<p>Reading the above, I detect a slight smouldering resentment at the fact Primitive Motion are still creating beautifully crafted, simmering pop nuggets &#8211; and me? I&#8217;m writing these words. (A while back we shared a stage together, as part of the ongoing awkward pop/garage collaboration, <a href="http://www.collapseboard.com/everett-true/live-recording-of-the-deadnotes-the-legend/">The Deadnotes + The Legend!</a>.) Not fair.</p>
<p>This is everything I once loved about UK bedroom electronic circa 1980 &#8211; and, trust me, I loved plenty about UK bedroom electronic circa 1980: loops and grace and repetition and gentle hummable melodies and drum machines and layered vocals and frantic but never jarring beats. So smooth, so soothing, so head and shoulders above most anyone else operating in similar territory right now. They&#8217;re well rid of the old cranky dude.</p>
<p><strong>Members knowingly played on stage with:</strong> Two. Sandra Selig and Leighton Craig.<br/>
<strong>Members in godhead awe of, and who haven&#8217;t bothered playing on stage with me since:</strong> Two. Leighton Craig and Sandra Selig.<br/>
<strong>Members in jealous funk at:</strong> Two. LC. SS.<br/>
<strong>PR for record label I&#8217;ve almost certainly been blacklisted by:</strong> One.<br/>
<strong>Running scores at the doors:</strong> Brisbane 3 Sydney 2.</p>
