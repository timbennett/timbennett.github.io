                <h3><strong>REN? SCHAEFER<em>* reports on Sunday&#8217;s Overground, a landmark Melbourne International Jazz Festival event that brought together proponents of the jazz and experimental scenes. Photos by *</em>PETE HYDE</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3010974/440x586-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There was a moment about halfway through Overground when experimental noise-rock literally threatened to bring down the establishment. In the grand ballroom of the Melbourne Town Hall, <strong>True Radical Miracle<em>* and **Golden Fur** were grinding out an almighty slow-burning sludge riff. Drummer **Evelyn Morris** (aka Pikelet) kept a steady, thudding beat on her kick drum, which turned into a brutal sub-bass throb in conjunction with bassist *</em>Leith Thomas</strong>, who was methodically pounding the head of his instrument into the polished floorboards of this municipal edifice.</p>
<p>Unsuspecting Jazz Festival patrons clapped hands over their ears as the deafening drone approached ?brown note? intensity. The very architecture was set vibrating, and suddenly it was snowing onto the stage and the crowd. But this was no stage prop &#8211; bits of the ornate gilded ceiling and chandeliers, high above people&#8217;s heads, were detaching and floating down, splendid as they swirled in the coloured lights trained at the performers. Equal parts fear and fascination could be read on the faces of the audience.</p>
<p>Overground organisers Sean Baxter, Sophie Brous and Annalee Koernig must have been rubbing their hands with anarchic glee at curating such a poignant moment at an event that encompassed many extremes of transcendent art and wilful obscurantism. It was always a risky undertaking to stage an event that paired local and international jazz improvisers with the cream of Australia&#8217;s experimental music community. The name Overground clearly stated Baxter, Brous and Koernig&#8217;s intent of dragging a clandestine and esoteric subculture into the light of a mainstream music festival.</p>
<p>The fun started as people filtered into the venue. Festival staff were clearly nonplussed, as dignified elder jazz aficionados rubbed shoulders with dreadlocked crust punks and tight-jeaned young noise fiends, eager to catch an early set by iconoclastic German free jazz saxophonist <strong>Peter Br&#8217;tzmann<em>* and legendary Dutch drummer *</em>Han Bennink</strong>.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3010977/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The wonder at such musical free associations was easily matched by the surprised looks on the faces of the two hapless bartenders who were inundated with wave upon wave of punters eager to suck down some quick beers before scurrying off all over the building to catch performances in obscure nooks and crannies. Incongruous and ironic juxtapositions between sound and architecture proliferated, as this most venerable institution was usurped by the likes of Sydney&#8217;s <strong>Pure Evil Trio<em>* and *</em>Occult Blood</strong>, who tried to outdo each other in volume and intensity in a mega-jam featuring two drum kits, feedback guitar, bass and electronic effects. The sight of vocalist Pete Hyde barking and growling within the stately, woodpanelled opulence of the Yarra Room, while sweaty men beat the bejesus out of their instruments, was absolutely priceless.</p>
<p>The program was dense and varied, with many performances overlapping in different rooms and permitting only limited audience numbers. It would have been impossible to catch every single act, so people had to abandon a certain amount of control and let themselves either be pulled along in surges up and down the marble stairs, or escape into the various passageways of the building to be surprised by roaming groups of improvising musicians.</p>
<p>Displays of extreme noise were balanced with gentle quietness, such as the delicate acoustic scrapings and whirrings of <strong>Kim Myhr<em>*, **Dale Gorfinkle** and *</em>Cor Fuhler</strong>, who had the audience straining to hear and see what they were doing in a darkened corner of the auditorium. Combining home-made instruments with delicate prepared piano sounds and acoustic guitar string vibrations proved to be utterly captivating, even over the sound of echoing footsteps and dropped plastic beer glasses on the wooden floor.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Festival staff were clearly nonplussed, as dignified elder jazz aficionados rubbed shoulders with dreadlocked crust punks and tight-jeaned young noise fiends.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Dave Brown<em>* (Bucketrider, Embers) and *</em>Kim Salmon</strong> (The Scientists, Surrealists) made full use of the intimidating setting of the Council Chamber, to present their set of deconstructed guitar scratches and cassette tape manipulations. Listeners sat in the very leather-upholstered pews that generations of fat-cat councillors have nodded off in, lulled by the soothing drone of mayoral speeches. Luckily, Brown and Salmon&#8217;s offering had quite the opposite effect, making people hang on to their ever string pluck or pitch change, as they carefully wove sounds around each other.</p>
<p>A visibly excited Baxter introduced one of the most highly anticipated collaborations of the evening, between pianist and composer <strong>Anthony Pateras<em>* and international guest *</em>Han Bennink</strong> on the drum kit. Explaining that this improvised performance had been inspired by the choice of venue, all eyes were on Pateras as he took a seat at the triple-tiered keyboard of the gigantic Town Hall Organ. Restored nine years ago at considerable cost, the organ has since featured in performances by the likes of composer Phillip Glass and minimalist Sydney jazz trio The Necks, of works specially commissioned by the City Of Melbourne.</p>
<p>This was slightly different though, as Pateras gleefully attacked the keys. He made the massive pipes shriek, whine and buzz in seemingly random high and low registers. Bennink attacked the drums with equally malicious intent. The veteran drummer flailed away like a man attacked by a swarm of bees, responding to the flurries of organ squeals and drones one second, and then goading Pateras on to new insanities with barrages of percussive thunder. It was fascinating to watch two masters of their craft have this much fun with their clothes on.</p>
<p>Introducing a visual element to proceedings, <strong>Joel Stern<em>* (a key member of Brisbane artists? collective Abject Leader) and *</em>Dirk De Bruyn</strong> presented multiple films, screened on the walls and ceiling of the main hall, accompanied by electronic audio collages. Like Abject Leader&#8217;s contribution to last year&#8217;s <a href="/articles/3814475">Static Age festival</a>, it was an exercise in post-Dadaism, as multiple projections of painted, scratched and mutilated film overlapped with the gigantic backlit shadows of the performers? shadows. This time, recurring images were flashes of Lettrist poetry and the shadows of hands in front of the projector &#8211; an ironic reference to the playful interventions of bored cinema audiences throughout the artform&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Attention then focused back on the main performance area, for another interesting meeting between local and international artists. <strong>Oren Ambarchi<em>* and **Marco Fusinato** are among this country&#8217;s most renowned aural experimenters. On this occasion they both utilised electric guitars and a tables overflowing with effects pedals and patch leads, to create a dense soundscape. Drummer *</em>Brian Chase</strong>, of new York&#8217;s Yeah Yeah Yeahs, did his best to rise above the massive din, but unfortunately his efforts were largely drowned out.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3010975/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>In the most disappointing scheduling clash of the evening, those who stayed in the main room had to miss out on a set by <strong>Simon Barker<em>* with **Bum Creek** and **Snawklor**, as well as a piano and trumpet piece by **Cor Fuhler** and **Scott Tinkler**. By all accounts, both were quite spectacular. As a consolation, it was possible to get up close to an amazing free form jam between renowned pianist **Paul Grabowsky** and *</em>Sean Baxter</strong> on the drums. The two musicians were completely in synch and clearly demonstrated that half of a good improvisational performance consists of listening to each other. Grabowsky leaned far into the body of his grand piano to pluck and scrape strings, as Baxter attacked his kit with pieces of twisted sheet metal, clattering bunches of chopsticks and oversized wok covers. There was something almost sexual in the way the drummer clutched these shiny semi-globes and caressed them lovingly. Like last year&#8217;s one-off performance as a trio with Lucas Abela, this was something of a historical meeting &#8211; a true synthesis of the old guard of jazz musicians with a proponent of the improv scene who embraces all manner of non-traditional sound experimentation while also possessing a lot of chops.</p>
<p>Following right on the heels of this breathtaking set, was the quartet of <strong>Mick Turner<em>* (guitar), **Francis Plagne** (guitar), **Erkki Veltheim** (viola) and *</em>Evelyn Morris</strong> (drums). Maybe a kind of fatigue had settled over everyone at this point &#8211; six hours is a long time to listen to improvised music &#8211; but both band and audience appeared somewhat subdued. The music the group created was not a million miles removed from some of The Dirty Three&#8217;s quieter moments, and debates over its merits continued late into the night. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3010976/440x586-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Maybe it didn&#8217;t help either that anticipation was building for another chance to see <strong>Br&#8217;tzmann<em>* and **Bennink** go head-to-head. Their brilliant free jazz exploration perfectly segued into the climax of the evening &#8211; **The Embers Big Band**. Embers seem to <a href="/articles/3814475">divide audiences</a> with their wall-of-sound approach to freeform skronk. This time, they pushed even further beyond the parameters of the reasonable, with a line-up that included three drummers (**Baxter**, Bennink and *</em>Kram</strong> from spiderbait), two basses and three saxophones. In true jazz fashion, musicians were both leaving room for each other to take solo spots and re-enter the fray to compete with each other.</p>
<p>This battle was most pronounced between the sax players. Br&#8217;tzmann and Embers mainstay <strong>Kris Wanders<em>* looked like bearded brothers in arms next to each other, as young gun *</em>Adam Simmons</strong> repeatedly challenged them from the other side of the stage. When Simmons brought out the big artillery in the form of a gigantic baritone sax, sparks really started to fly. Greg Kingston valiantly underpinned their flights of fancy with barbed wire guitar shards.</p>
<p>Kram managed to get in some nice musical digs at Bennink when he threatened to introduce a more straightforward beat &#8211; something the older musician had dismissed as too cliched during his set with Pateras. <strong>Dave Brown<em>* grabbed his chance during a quiet moment to bust out some fine distorted bass chords, but pulled back to let *</em>Abel Cross</strong> from Pure Evil Trio have the last word with a tasteful double bass solo, which was probably the closest thing to a standard jazz progression heard all day.</p>
<p>With that, it was all over. The experiment had worked. A sell-out crowd witnessed an array of some of the finest creators of contemporary music. Overground was a landmark event that proved that experimental music need not languish in a ghetto of its own making, but can command respect among serious music lovers, despite its high decibels and often confrontational reputation. If it can threaten to collapse the odd government building in the process, so much the better. </p>
