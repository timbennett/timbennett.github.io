                <h3>On second solo album &#8216;Arrows At The Sun&#8217;, Martin Craft puts the past to bed, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008680/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
A sunny afternoon in late November finds Martin Craft lazing about on the footpath in Sydney&#8217;s trendy inner-east. Having just flown in from chilly London, he&#8217;s eager to talk outside, but not before plugging in his hands free. ?My hands are free, I&#8217;m not sure if you want to know that.? His nine years in London clearly affecting his humour as much as his muddled accent.</p>
<p>Craft is back in Australia for his yearly sojourn, splitting time between a friend&#8217;s place in Darlinghurst and his parents? house in Wollongong. He&#8217;s returned annually to Australia for the past five years, but this time he has business to attend to: a new album, <em>Arrows At The Sun</em>; a series of dates last December with Jarvis Cocker (as a member of his backing band and in support); a Sydney Festival performance with Andrew Bird a few weeks ago; two solo shows of his own in Melbourne and Sydney this weekend; and a support slot at Canberra Theatre with Joanna Newsom on January 21.</p>
<p>?It&#8217;s kinda cool when I come back to Australia. It&#8217;s a bit of a <em>Blues Brothers</em> process of calling up all my old friends and seeing who&#8217;s got the time, the inclination and the liver,? he says of piecing together his backing band, which includes The Lovetones? Matt Sigley and his friends Michelle, an art student/sculptor, and Jim, an ?IT guy?. </p>
<p>Similarly, <em>Arrows At The Sun</em> &#8211; a languid and artistically diverse set of songs that run the gamut from polished MOR pop (?Young and in Love?) to fragile ballads (?The Last Leaf of Summer?) &#8211; features contributions from Craft&#8217;s wide network of musician friends including Matt Radzyner, a Qantas pilot, who played a David Sanborn-esque sax solo on ?Susie And Me?. ?He&#8217;s doing the Sydney to London 747 route and sometimes he&#8217;d just call me and say, ?I&#8217;m here. I started taking my sax around with me.? It conjoured up very funny images of this second officer in the cockpit serenading the captain as the sun came up,? he jokes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s through this same network of friends that Craft found himself playing guitar in Jarvis Cocker&#8217;s band. But he&#8217;s quick to downplay his involvement with the former Pulp frontman. ?It&#8217;s not going to go on forever, and it&#8217;s not the biggest deal in the world, but I jokingly call it my day job,? he says. </p>
<blockquote><p>?I had to do everything &#8211; from the menial to the majestic and everything in between. It&#8217;s hard to put your mind on so many different things.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, he flirted with the idea of asking Cocker, who he describes as a ?natural performer?, to guest on the album. ?It crossed my mind once, but he&#8217;s a really busy guy,? explains Craft. ?Being Jarvis Cocker is a full-time job and I never really wanted to blur the lines with him. I didn&#8217;t read the press release and it must&#8217;ve said that I play with him, but I like to keep it as a different issue. It&#8217;s not really the same life.?</p>
<p><em>Arrows At The Sun</em> was recorded over ?three part-time? years in Craft&#8217;s studio in the London suburb of Hackney; a process that took a toll on the singer, who built the studio from the ground up. He&#8217;s since decided to ?pack it in?.</p>
<p>?I set it up to make the record and, at the end of the process of having made a record, I felt like I didn&#8217;t really want to do it that way ever again. In other words, taking it upon oneself to do absolutely everything &#8211; from building the studio to engineering and maintenance. I decided to let it go,? he explains.</p>
<p>?You end up going around in circles when you don&#8217;t get any second opinion and there&#8217;s no one around to help you,? he continues. ?In a big, professional recording situation, bands have people going out and getting them cappuccinos and giving them manicures, and there&#8217;s a reason for it. Supposedly, the more you can concentrate on the music, the quicker you can get it done and the better it will be. For me, it was the exact opposite. I had to do everything &#8211; from the menial to the majestic and everything in between. It&#8217;s hard to put your mind on so many different things.?</p>
<p>But Craft knew what he was getting into for <em>Arrows At The Sun*; after all, he made its predecessor, the bossa nova-influenced *Silver And Fire</em> (2007), in a similar do-it-all-yourself fashion in several home studios. So why did he go through with that process again? ?I don&#8217;t know,? he laughs. ?It&#8217;s one of those things, isn&#8217;t it? Basically, I&#8217;m a sucker for punishment &#8211; I&#8217;ve got no regrets though. You do what you do at the time.?</p>
<p>For ?practical reasons?, the album was recorded on eight-track and mixed later on computer. Craft found the mix of old and new technologies liberating. ?The main thing I enjoy about using analog is that there are no computer screens in the room looking at you, so you find yourself looking out the window and actually listening to the music with your ears rather than looking at the music with your eyes.?</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008681/440x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The album&#8217;s first line, ?We spent so long in second-hand stores/We forgot there was anything new?, delivered over rolling piano and warm synths on ?The Beautiful Future?, is particularly telling. While the song itself was influenced by a newspaper report on the discovery of a new tribe in the Amazon (?It made me start thinking that there are still things to discover,? says Craft), it was also written with his brother Nick in mind. </p>
<p>The pair formed Sidewinder as teenagers in Canberra in 1991, releasing two acclaimed albums and supporting the likes of U2, before disbanding in 1999. Craft decamped to London to embark on a solo career, with his brother &#8211; a PhD student at Oxford and part-time frontman of Aus-UK outfit Zillions &#8211; in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>?That&#8217;s like a letter to my brother almost,? says Craft of ?The Beautiful Future?. ?My brother and I, our life pursuit has been trawling flea markets. It&#8217;s a very dusty existence. We both have issues with the past and getting a bit too wrapped up in it maybe.?</p>
<p>While Craft has virtually ruled out a Sidewinder reunion &#8211; ?I don&#8217;t think we want to go back to it,? he says &#8211; the bond between both brothers is still particularly close. ?He&#8217;s always the first person I turn to for advice. We listen to loads of the same music, but what he makes is different to what I make at the moment. I have a feeling we might work on something again together in the next few years.? One thing&#8217;s for certain: it won&#8217;t be called Sidewinder.</p>
<p>?Nick&#8217;s about to finish his PhD in early modern history and I&#8217;m busy doing all sorts of stuff, so I think we&#8217;re both feeling good about living in the present tense,? he says. ?We might make separate records with the same premise, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.?</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><em>Arrows At The Sun</em> is out now through Spunk. Craft will launch the album on January 15 at the Oxford Arts Factory in Sydney and January 16 at the Northcote Social Club in Melbourne.</p>
