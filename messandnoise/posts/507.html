                <h3>In part two of his European tour diary, <strong>JAMIE HUTCHINGS</strong> and his drummer-brother Scott encounter an ?American Banjo Master? in Italy, some ludicrously expensive Big Macs in Copenhagen and a bill full of tribute bands in London.

<h2>?Why You Here??</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014477/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Frieda, our GPS guide, really comes to the rescue as we drive endlessly through a labyrinth of tiny streets surrounded by farmlands to reach the Rive Jazz Club in Bassano. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very groovy retro-inspired venue. Out the front on the blackboard reads ?Jamis and Adam Hutchings. Great!? Giovanna, our effervescent host, greets us and when she realises her mistake and sees us posing in front of the sign she shrieks and tries to rub it out before the evidence can be documented. </p>
<p>She proves to be a great woman setting us up in a beautiful ancient terrace owned by a local painter who is away for a couple of days and offering us beautiful Chianti from Tuscany. She collects vintage television sets and old French magazines. It&#8217;s a quiet night as it&#8217;s in the middle of the holidays and so loads of people are away at the sea, but the audience are very attentive. We sell quiet a lot of stuff and meet some great people who are keen on helping us get some bigger shows next time including one of the local festivals. Giovanna&#8217;s mum reckons we are the best thing she&#8217;s seen at the club from more than 200 gigs and insists on paying for a CD. Mums know best.</p>
<p>We have a day off so we check out Venice the next day, which is way more crowded than last time. Scott snaps a picture of a gelato owner, who totally loses his mind over this unlawful intrusion screaming at us all the way down the street but unfortunately he is glued to his stand and simply can&#8217;t do to Scott the true harm he threatens.</p>
<p>We head to Ravenna where we are playing a couple of nights in a small town at a bar called Lismore. The sound guy is a retired psychologist and Dinosaur Jr fan so we get on pretty good. We play an outside stage equipped with some American Indian-styled props, a tepee and some other stuff. Plenty of people, but we get a bit lost. The two CDs we sell are to the sound guys. We head back to the hotel and Scott is leafing through a glossy magazine. He finds a two-page advertisement for what appears to be a very popular longstanding band from Italy who have just released ?their definitive collection?. The name of the band? ?Pooh?. One of their old albums is called <em>Boomerang</em>. Think about that for a while.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3014474/640x420-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We play another show at the same venue the next night this time supporting an American guy or ?American Banjo Master? as our worksheet bills him called Tony Trischia. He&#8217;s a champion guy who saw Dylan in ?63 and ?64, which is pretty impressive. His backing band are all Italian guys who play in a very authentic bluegrass band called ?Red Wine?. They sing in perfect American twang-y southern accents. We make a couple of fans and one guy invites us to his table where his wife is waiting. It turns out he&#8217;s an Italian soldier who has spent time in both Afghanistan and Iraq and is very keen on getting out. Italians are ?lovers not fighters?, he says. We tell him we&#8217;re keen on him getting out too. Says the Americans are very gung ho over there and that he&#8217;s missing watching his daughters grow up. He&#8217;s a pretty discerning music fan and asks if I remember an Australian band from the ?80s who played great ?60s garage pop. ?The Stems?? I offer ?Mama Mia!!? he cries. Then he looks around and asks a question that has been put to me since time immemorial in my performing history albeit in a strong Italian accent: ?Why you here??</p>
<p>The next day involves driving, driving and more driving. We have a brief stop in Pisa to check out the leaning tower of Pisa. Frieda again takes us by the hand and leads us up through the mist to a town on the peak of a mountain called Bardineto. We are playing at the Balla Coi Cinghiali festival. When we finally arrive we see swarms of feral youngsters. In true Italian style there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a festival rep about for miles just loads of people and noise. I text Marco, the contact on the worksheet. A while later I get a text from a Marco from Sicily who has no idea what I&#8217;m talking about but wishes me luck. </p>
<p>We work it out. A lot of the bands here seem to partner Julio Iglesias- styled romantic dramatism with heavy rock theatrics. Scott spies a goth rock band on the large stage who have one guy in the band who dresses in a grim reaper outfit. No instrument, just hanging out on stage. The best band we see is a group featuring two singers who partner Italian-styled traditional pop with Mr Bungle-styled spazz metal. They&#8217;re pretty good. The band before us do a rock&#8217;n?roll triathlon-length set that sends things an hour overtime. </p>
<p>The folks here are pretty enthusiastic though, or perhaps super intoxicated. I figure this gig will be an abomination. It&#8217;s not though. Despite ridiculous spill from the other stages we manage to hold their attention really well, finding some kind of synergy together. The spill from the techno stage is so insane that we invite the audience onstage to sit in front of the foldbacks so they can at least hear us better to which many of them happily comply. It&#8217;s probably our best show here and we sell a stack of CDs frantically from the stage while the next band is trying to set up. Feeling fairly smug we head back off down the mountain at around midnight.</p>

<h2>?A Gig In Berlin?</h2>
<p>The tail-end of this tour is somewhat of an experiment. Physically, psychologically, geographically and financially. The first stop is Berlin. The flight leaves at 6.45 am which means a three-and-a-half hour drive to Milan straight from the festival to once again fly with the infamous ?Povo Air?. Sleep is a luxury obviously for those coined up enough to fly during waking hours. Not us. We hang outside the airport from around 3.30 am with the other sullen backpackers until it opens and eventually arrive in Berlin around 8.30am. We do the sweaty zombie thing for awhile till we stumble into the hostel we&#8217;re staying at, and amazingly, are playing at. The receptionist sheepishly informs me that due to some confusion our rooms won&#8217;t be ready until 4pm. Do we want to help ourselves to breakfast instead? Do we?! </p>
<p>We run into my old mate Chris Hogan, a man I am generally indebted to for all manner of goodly music helping deeds. He offers to show Scott around Berlin. Scott is keen to continue waging the war against sleep and takes him up on his offer given that he has never visited before. Berlin is amazing, however, I have been here before and am having sleep fantasies. Thankfully, the receptionist has rectified the room situation so I climb the four stories and collapse.</p>
<p>We are playing in ?the courtyard?, which is kind of a <em>Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii</em> situation. A huge concrete slab a million miles from the outside seating arrangement. Scott and I have a debate on how to rectify this, but reach a stalemate and decide to roll with the empty arena vibe. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we are stumbling through the endless back alleys to the flat we are staying at Scott says, &#8216;I don&#8217;t how you keep doing this.&#8217; I&#8217;ve been asked this a few times.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Berlin resident Harry Coltello doubles as PA provider, as well as opening act and does some tasty Ry Cooder <em>Paris Texas*-styled solo instrumental pieces. We drone away and it ends up sounding pretty good up there. It&#8217;s no *Wings of Desire</em>, but it&#8217;s a gig in Berlin. We get invited to make some musical noise with some friends of friends who have a drum kit and some amplifiers set up in their apartment. Given that it&#8217;s now midnight and they live in an apartment I decline but not Scott. Despite his sleep debt he takes up the offer. He later tells me that, yes, they did indeed have a drum kit and amp set up; and, yes, it was in a very small flat in a crowded block of units, but they assured him that noise was not a problem in this neighborhood. They bashed their instruments for a half-hour or so before being politely interrupted by the local police. Fair enough. I am coaxed into walking to a nearby night club where we are greeted by a mile-long queue. Chris and I do a U-turn and head back.</p>
<p>We get up at 6.45 am. Scott has managed to clock up an awesome three hours of sleep in 48 hours and spends the majority of these hours conducting his own private nasal orchestra. It&#8217;s quite a racket! This man is tired.</p>
<p>Copenhagen is full of very helpful good looking people but it&#8217;s also three times more expensive than anywhere else on planet earth. While hanging outside the local McDonald&#8217;s we work out that a Big Mac here costs around $12-14 AUD. Yummy. Our host Jacob packs our stuff into a cart attached to his bicycle. He lives in a council flat out of town with two chinchillas. We&#8217;re here to play at the Copenhagen Songwriters festival. A last minute gig that Amanda has wrangled us that I know very little about. </p>
<p>We crash for a while before meeting a friend called Trina, who has kindly rustled up some bicycles and insists it&#8217;s the only way to see Copenhagen. My threads are suave but I look a fool with my hideous quicksilver backpack and total lack of pedaling coordination. It&#8217;s liberating though. We briefly check out a free local doof festival before heading to the show. </p>
<p>The drum kit has arrived sans any hardware. I suggest to the organiser the option of someone holding the snare while Scott hits it and balances the cymbal on their pinky, but he wisely decides to make a few calls. The fest is pretty thin on people, but thick on earnest singer/songwriter types. You think I&#8217;m earnest? You gotta check this place out. </p>
<p>Our spot is at 11pm but we have been pushed back as a surprise special guest has agreed to play an exclusive secret show. We are told this will work a treat for us as she will play to a full house and everyone will hang around to check us out. Ever played after someone really popular? Remember what happened? Anyway she plays a Missy Higgins-type set to a reverential audience who exit when she exits and we enter at around 1am .It&#8217;s a little tough going and my acoustic sounds a little like a tennis racket with strings but we&#8217;re good. </p>
<p>Get back to our place of lodging around 4am. As we are stumbling through the endless back alleys to the flat we are staying at Scott says, ?I don&#8217;t how you keep doing this.? I&#8217;ve been asked this a few times. I&#8217;m still thinking of a clever answer. Text me suggestions.</p>
<p>We snooze deeply till mid-morning and then hightail it into the drizzle back to the airport and fly to London. We are playing at a place called The Half Moon in Putney. Except for Damo Suzuki, who is billed here, most of the other acts on their schedule appear to be tribute bands. Remember tribute bands? It seems this antipodean plague has finally left our shores and landed in full force in London. </p>
<p>Anyway, we lug our junk from the train station. The backpacking/acoustic lug is really wearing thin now. Our mate Tom meets us there with an amp which is sweet. We are staying at our friend Chantelle&#8217;s house and she has managed to drum up a few friends to come, but apart from them it&#8217;s a little lame on numbers. London has a million bands and if you think venues in Sydney are tough on bands they seem to take it to a new level of extortion. Well, at least some of the places do. None of the bands get paid tonight. It&#8217;s not packed but it&#8217;s not empty either. I do my best to argue our case to the bar manager but realise quite quickly it&#8217;s an exercise in futility. It&#8217;s time to blow this popsicle stand and sit on a plane for 24 hours.</p>
