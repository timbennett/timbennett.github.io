                <h3>Aleks Bryant gives us an insight into the 10 tracks that make up Aleks and the Ramps? second album &#8216;Midnight Believer&#8217;.
</h3>
<h2>?Destroy the Universe with Jazz Hands?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004427/440x377-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="377"/><br/>
I recorded this one as a demo ages ago and didn&#8217;t have any lyrics so I just laid down a vocal track of singing the melody in gibberish. That&#8217;d be a pretty funny song to use as a b-side or something, but I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;d feel OK with letting the public hear it. Someone (I think maybe Extreme Wheeze) said it sounded like it could be a protest song or something, but instead it turned into a stream-of-conscious rant about a guy whose memories consist entirely of apocalyptic hipster role plays/dance moves and outdated phone numbers. Or something. If you listen closely, you can hear the unique squeals of Billy Corgan.</p>
<h2>?Walking in the Garden?</h2>
<p>There was this project called &#8220;Hidden Bookshelf&#8221; where these guys found a bookshelf with fake books and titles. They asked a whole bunch of writers and musicians to create something based on the title of a book on this shelf. We were asked to do it, and by the time I put in my preferences for what title we&#8217;d do, all the ones I wanted were gone. ?Black Milk?, ?Waterside Planting? and ?Dagger Lane? were titles that I tried to put dibs on, but someone else&#8217;s dibs were already on them so we ended up with ?Walking in the Garden? which isn&#8217;t really a bad title or anything. Its secret Ramp title is ?Laaaaaaaaaaser?. True Fact.</p>
<h2>?Hey Owl?</h2>
<p>This is a song, it has guitars on it and some drums and other things like keyboards.</p>
<h2>?Circa 1992 Ideas?</h2>
<p>The original title of this song was ?Plasma X-Tron 4000?. Actually now that I think about it, most of these songs have had around two or three titles. We&#8217;ve got a little stash of spare titles floating around &#8211; if any bands out there want a title, drop us a line and we&#8217;ll see what we can do. Potential Falcon and Slo-Mo Speedboat were originally Ramp titles that are now a band name and soloist name, respectively.<br/>
This title came from a nightmare Denim Owl had when she went to bed after watching Walter Murch&#8217;s creepy/incredibly cheesy <em>Return To Oz</em>. In the nightmare, our kitten (Wind Panther) was sleeping on Denim Owl while whispering evil ?circa 1980 ideas? into her ear.</p>
<h2>?The Non in Non-Fiction?</h2>
<p>Vocals were recorded for this track and it was going to be called, ?This Heavy Breathing Is Just For Show?. I decided that it was better as an instrumental.</p>
<h2>?Boy Meets Ghost?</h2>
<p>This is the oldest song on the record. The original lyrics were me singing something in Spanish that meant roughly, &#8220;Are you under the impression that I seek your companionship only for sex and nothing else?&#8221;, followed by random tourist Spanish like, &#8220;At what time does the bus leave?&#8221; and &#8220;How much for two beers? Are they cold? I very much like cold beer&#8221;. It&#8217;s pretty different now. When we play this live, there&#8217;s a big epic noise jam stuck in the middle that didn&#8217;t seem to work on the record. Special!</p>
<h2>?Whiplash?</h2>
<p>This one features a friend of ours named Mikey. He does a baritone &#8220;oooh-oooh&#8212;ooooh&#8221; and goes &#8220;waaaaahhh!&#8221; at various points. He also referred to the guitar tone as &#8220;rinky dink&#8221;. Phhh! Whatevs dude.<br/>
This song initially was about going to the airport to pick up someone who doesn&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re coming, simultaneously trying to figure out what flight they&#8217;re on and how cigarette butts slipped through your pockets into the lining of you jacket. But then it turned into something else, something along the lines of &#8220;boy stalks girl, girl rejects boy, boy starts a plastics manufacturing business in Keilor&#8221;. You know the drill. Evelyn &#8220;Pikelet&#8221; Morris does some angelic &#8220;oooohs&#8221; on this too.</p>
<h2>?Amputee Pilots?</h2>
<p>I wrote this in a Hotel room. True story.</p>
<h2>?Weather Patterns&#8217;</h2>
<p>Captain Rad, who used to play drums in the Ramps, moved to Mongolia a little while ago. He&#8217;s been writing poetry and sending them to me sporadically and I asked him if he&#8217;d like to donate some poems to use in the liner notes in the record. He was pretty psyched to do it, so he sent me a bunch of poems that we could use, and they&#8217;re pretty freakin? ace. In the end it didn&#8217;t gel with Lily [Coate&#8217;s] artwork plan to have a whole bunch of text in the sleeve, so we had to ditch it, but we whipped up this little piece to showcase something he wrote called ?History?. It&#8217;s read aloud by the built in Mac OS X voice called &#8220;Alex&#8221;.</p>
<h2>?Antique Limb?</h2>
<p>Pop songs are really fun to write, who would have thought? We&#8217;re going to do more. This one used to have a melody that was a direct rip off of Robbie Williams&#8217; ?Tripping? so we changed it. I&#8217;m running out of time, so I&#8217;ll wrap it up by saying, &#8220;Shaaamoneeeee!!&#8221;</p>
