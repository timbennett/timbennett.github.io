                <h1><strong>&#8220;This is Brisbane history/Creeping round the background&#8221;</strong></h1>
<p><strong>&#8211; &#8216;Sundowner,&#8217; <em>Battle of Brisbane</em>, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Kitchen&#8217;s Floor has been a constant of Brisbane&#8217;s underground since 2008. Ostensibly the mouth-piece of singer-songwriter Matt Kennedy, the band&#8217;s releases have documented seven years of a specific subset of the city through the nation&#8217;s bleakest looking glass. In 2009&#8217;s <em>Loneliness is a Dirty Mattress</em> and 2011&#8217;s <em>Look Forward to Nothing</em>, Kitchen&#8217;s Floor delivered a spectrum of negative thought with unashamed honesty, causing storied personal rifts and confused social interactions for the band&#8217;s immediate circle. But for those of us outside of it, these albums represented something darkly relatable: archives of dejection built from every warbled, half-shouted lyric.</p>
<p>On their third LP <em>Battle of Brisbane</em>, Kitchen&#8217;s Floor make it clear from the outset that this is part of an ongoing document of the band&#8217;s home city. &#8220;This is Brisbane history,&#8221; Kennedy shouts to begin the record, and the band responds with a newly realised vigour. Kennedy&#8217;s guitar sounds more like it was pinched from a touring stadium act than picked off the council pick-up pile. Josh Watson&#8217;s bass is not just serviceable, but of scope and focus (particularly on the reimagining of &#8216;Bitter Defeat&#8217;), and Robert Vagg&#8217;s drums come heavily through the mix. This new cacophony of sound evokes an overzealous terror at the edges, acting to obscure the ruminations of Kennedy&#8217;s vocals.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think because I&#8217;ve been isolated for so long I&#8217;ve gone a bit insane. I live alone and don&#8217;t have much in the way of friendships or relationships these days.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the album&#8217;s title suggests, this third LP delivers a new message to what came before it. It pushes outward at a city rather than mumbling underneath it. Even the record&#8217;s cover &#8211; featuring Kennedy, back to the camera in full military regalia, staring over the expanse of the city &#8211; claims the drawing of battle lines. If this is a record that spends its time in the trenches then, it&#8217;s clear the sentiment of each song hasn&#8217;t travelled far from the dishevelled bedroom that was the setting of records prior. In the LP&#8217;s defiant opener &#8216;Sundowner&#8217;, the mid-song calls to: &#8220;Defend the streets&#8221; fade to a desperate close. &#8220;When are they going to leave?&#8221; Kennedy asks. &#8220;I hate everybody here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brisbane (like most Australian cities) is experiencing an extended period of growth. This development is prevalent in Kennedy&#8217;s adopted home, the inner-west suburb of Paddington, which has evolved from the low-rent creative&#8217;s paradise of 2008 to a bustling area of young professionals. It&#8217;s no secret that this evolution has driven much of this record&#8217;s focus, with the high-rise at the centre of the album cover accompanied by the anonymous urban sprawl that leads to the record&#8217;s author. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been witnessing change around me but never taking part in it,&#8221; Kennedy tells me over a late-night phone call. &#8220;I&#8217;ve watched everything get renovated, the rent going up&#8230;I&#8217;ve had to be at the whim of town planners and watch the horrible people move in around me and just deal with it. So I burrowed in and haven&#8217;t left.&#8221; The burrow he talks about is, of course, the once storied share-house known as 116.</p>

<p>The bleakest Kitchen&#8217;s Floor recordings lay on their first record, <em>Loneliness is a Dirty Mattress</em>. Presented plainly in a black cover with type-written labelling, the songs boiled down complicated personal conflicts into cryptic sniping and shouted ramblings. In its insert, a black-and-white photograph of a broken down Queenslander is presented without comment. This building was Kennedy&#8217;s home for nine years, the share-house which itself had a title track on Kitchen&#8217;s Floor&#8217;s second record, <em>Look Forward to Nothing</em> (&#8220;The walls are rotting,&#8221; Kennedy sings). In this photo, the paint of a slapped-together fence peels back at the edges of its age-worn timber. It stands as one of the lasting images of a house that only this year was transformed into a medical centre, with Kennedy living alone in a new granny flat fashioned beneath it. &#8220;I think the landlord was embarrassed of having the only un-renovated house in the suburb,&#8221; Kennedy says dryly. &#8220;It has a white picket fence now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most recent visual document of 116 was the film clip for the version of &#8216;Bitter Defeat&#8217; that featured on a self-titled 7&#8221; in 2013: Kitchen&#8217;s Floor&#8217;s final release on <em>Negative Guest List</em>, the cult Brisbane label run by Brendon Annesley. This version of &#8216;Bitter Defeat&#8217; featured the tinny acoustic that Kennedy made a hallmark of his earlier recordings, and, undercut by the mournful organ of Cured Pink&#8217;s Andrew McLellan, was a surprising downer for a band that tended to simmer more often than stifle. On <em>Battle of Brisbane</em>, Kennedy gives &#8216;Bitter Defeat&#8217; the same treatment his landlord gave to 116. This re-recorded version does away with McLellan&#8217;s organ, doubles the tempo and makes an overdriven and overzealous bassline its centre-point. Taking the previously hallowed version to a near frenzy, this new lick of paint extends its aural scope, but is unable to hide the emptying sentiment of the original: &#8220;The window is open to a nothing day,&#8221; Kennedy moans.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a notable shift in the language of <em>Battle of Brisbane</em> compared to the previous records. Only once on the entire album does anyone else appear (on &#8216;Aches&#8217;: &#8220;I have no idea what you&#8217;ve been through&#8221;). The rest of it settles on themes of Kennedy&#8217;s self-loathing and a growing disgust for the city that houses him. &#8220;This place used to be good,&#8221; Kennedy spits on &#8216;Strength,&#8217; and sums up all the sentiment of latter-day Kitchen&#8217;s Floor in the entirety of &#8216;Down&#8217;:</p>
<p><em>Looking down at the fucking ground<br/>
I&#8217;m sick of walking down this street</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve nothing left to give<br/>
But they won&#8217;t even think about me</em></p>
<p><em>Waking up your dead friends</em></p>
<p><em>The wine has done its job<br/>
Finally I won&#8217;t think about this</em></p>
<p>&#8220;When I first moved [to Paddington] things were happening, I could put house shows on, but now I don&#8217;t have any of that,&#8221; Kennedy says. &#8220;I think because I&#8217;ve been isolated for so long I&#8217;ve gone a bit insane. I live alone and don&#8217;t have much in the way of friendships or relationships these days, so there&#8217;s nothing to write about in that way. So why not make this record about humanity in general, and write the most nihilistic, fucked-up rock album I could?&#8221;</p>
<p>If <em>Battle of Brisbane</em> is that fucked up rock album, then the track that opens its B-Side is its biggest moment. Featuring howling violins, Blank Realm&#8217;s Sarah Spencer on backing vocals, and an undeniable melody, &#8216;Doomed&#8217; is the most conventional Kitchen&#8217;s Floor song ever recorded. It&#8217;s one that Kennedy says was his &#8220;attempt at writing a Gotye-like hit single so [he] wouldn&#8217;t be broke anymore&#8221;. He&#8217;s self-aware enough to note that this effort in itself was doomed, with the repeating mantra, &#8220;Everybody will leave you/Nothing to love,&#8221; hardly a chart-topping sentiment. It&#8217;s clear that on this record, Kennedy&#8217;s been unable (or unwilling) to shy away from his existential dread, maybe because the battle came to him without his asking for it. &#8220;If you stay somewhere for long enough, and you keep doing what feels natural, and you think that something good will come of it: that&#8217;s not the most satisfying way to go about life. The frustration and self-loathing comes into it and you get down about your choices of sticking around too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feeling disenfranchised by the gentrification of your city is hardly a novel concept, but Kennedy has always had a uniquely honest take on how events like that translate to feelings of isolation. In a way, Kitchen&#8217;s Floor has always been dedicated to expressing loneliness and its side-effects through an absurdist bent. On <em>Look Forward to Nothing</em>, that was evoked on the album cover by the yellowed image of Kennedy sitting hungover and dejected in his nicotine-stained bedroom. On <em>Battle of Brisbane</em>, this arises in the fantastical war on a city that doesn&#8217;t even know the band exists. By remaining in Brisbane, even as it changes into something increasingly unsavoury, Kennedy has shown a strange loyalty to the city (&#8220;If I left it would feel like betrayal,&#8221; he says). It&#8217;s this kind of stubborn resilience in contributing to a town that breeds the bitterness; you&#8217;re rarely rewarded for perseverance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to get a point out there, about that disconnect between ordinary life and feeling the usual angsty clich&#233;s about the world,&#8221; Kennedy explains. &#8220;Not having anyone to be close with here, or being able to have those close relationships that make life fun&#8230;I think it&#8217;s kind of a comment on all of those things, from my own point of view living alone in the most gentrified suburb in Brisbane, wondering how the fuck I&#8217;m going to keep paying my rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a continuity to Kitchen&#8217;s Floor that can be drawn across six years of recordings, &#8220;like a conspiracy,&#8221; Kennedy jokes. The more obscure threads aside, the connectivity is clearest on the closing track of each LP. Like a timestamp, each track declares Kennedy&#8217;s age at the time of writing each record. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to embrace your age,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m obsessed with how time progresses; I have been ever since I was a kid.&#8221; Each of these tracks demonstrates the evolution of Kitchen&#8217;s Floor, in a way, showing exactly what led to the waging of a silent war on <em>Battle of Brisbane</em>. Broken down by a failure to upkeep personal relationships on &#8216;Twenty-two&#8217;; pure stagnation on &#8216;Twenty-four&#8217; (&#8220;This backyard is never going to change&#8221;); and rumination on &#8216;Twenty-eight&#8217; (&#8220;Why have you hung around? / Haunting my thoughts&#8221;), it&#8217;s a tidy way of demonstrating the ongoing document of Kitchen&#8217;s Floor. &#8220;Depending on how I go, the last song on the next album might be &#8216;Forty-two,&#8217;&#8221; Kennedy laughs. &#8220;If I live that long.&#8221;</p>
