                <h3>The Church&#8217;s <strong>STEVE KILBEY<em>* and All India Radio&#8217;s *</em>MARTIN KENNEDY</strong> share more than a mutual admiration of eachother&#8217;s music &#8211; they&#8217;re comic book nerds as well.
</h3>

All India Radio&#8217;s Martin Kennedy was a fresh-faced school kid when he first saw The Church. It was 1981 and the band were playing alongside the Sunnyboys, Men at Work, Midnight Oil and Split Enz at the Tanelorn Festival in rural NSW. ?They blew me away,? Kennedy recalls. ?I still have my prized cassette recording of that show and I have followed them ever since.?</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Kennedy, Church frontman Steve Kilbey was a fan of his work too. He was first introduced to All India Radio &#8211; the experimental outfit formed by Kennedy in 2000 &#8211; by his brother John, a fan of the band.</p>
<p>?Steve liked what he heard and thought a collaboration would be a good idea,? says Kennedy. ?The Church are my favourite Aussie band and one of my all time favourite bands in general so it was both a shock and an honour to hear from him. I never said that to Steve though &#8211; I think it would embarrass him too much!?</p>
<p>The idea was soon hatched for <em>Unseen Music Unheard Words</em>, a collaboration between the two musicians that would take place in separate cities: Kilbey&#8217;s hometown of Sydney, and Melbourne, where Kennedy lives. But unlike, say The Postal Service, the pair worked in isolation for more than a year &#8211; without so much as en email exchanged.</p>
<p>?We didn&#8217;t need to,? Kennedy adds. ?It was simple operation. I sent him the music, he wrote and recorded the words and that was it. It was another six months before we began to email and eventually spoke to each other.?</p>
<p>Given its strange genesis, we thought we&#8217;d get the pair together to chat about the inspiration behind the album, their plans for a follow-up and the challenges of recording in separate states. Instead, they invented a fictional interviewer &#8211; a comic book nerd &#8211; and probed eachother&#8217;s fascination with Marvel and DC.</p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: I heard you guys were into comics while growing up. Were you Marvel or DC guys or didn&#8217;t it matter?</strong></p>
<p>Steve Kilbey: I started out DC but I ended up Marvel</p>
<p>MK: I started out Marvel, went to DC for a bit and then back to Marvel. I didn&#8217;t know Steve was into comics until I read about it recently. When Steve came to my place a few years ago, I had my entire collection boxed up in the lounge room, ready to sell on eBay. If I had known we could&#8217;ve pulled them out for a look. It&#8217;s more exciting than rehearsing for a gig.</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Who were your favourite comic characters?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Namor the Submariner, the Silver Surfer, Doctor Doom, The Vision.</p>
<p>MK: mainly Jack Kirby-drawn characters (but not all of them) including Fantastic Four, a few X-Mens, The Eternals, 2001 A Space Odyssey (which started off as a very loose film tie-in, but then got extremely weird).</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Did you ever collect comics or did you just read and chuck ?em away?</strong></p>
<p>SK: I wasn&#8217;t a collector for collecting sake. I guess I read ?em and lost ?em.</p>
<p>MK: I read them and chucked them. Foolish child. Collecting comics was only something I started as an adult. For two crazy years between 1997 and 1999 I collected 90 percent of the <em>Fantastic Four</em> series and a whole lot more. An expensive adventure, but at least I read them all. Not long after that I started my band All India Radio and my interest in collecting waned.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I didn&#8217;t know Steve was into comics until I read about it recently. When Steve came to my place a few years ago, I had my entire collection boxed up in the lounge room, ready to sell on eBay. If I had known we could&#8217;ve pulled them out for a look.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Did you pay much attention to the stories and dialogue or was it a strictly visual thing?</strong></p>
<p>SK: No no. The stories were very important. It was the combo of the two, I guess.</p>
<p>MK: I was a visual guy. Back to Jack Kirby again &#8211; his artwork totally blew me away. It was mystical, sci-fi, epic and just plain weird. Memories of his art have stayed with me. I found it hard to remember the stories though.</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Steve, do you think your work as an artist today has some roots in your enjoyment of comics as a child?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Possibly, a little.</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Have you had a chance to see some of the recent superhero films of recent years, and what did you think?</strong></p>
<p>SK: I liked <em>Iron Man*, but it was very altered from the *Iron Man* I used to know. Sometimes the updating seems to ruin it. *Fantastic Four</em> was alright</p>
<p>MK: I had high hopes for the <em>Fantastic Four* films a few years ago but they were very lame. The *Spiderman* films were a bit of a yawn too. I enjoyed *Iron Man*. Robert Downey Jr played him well. And the recent *Batman</em> films were good.</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Have both of you ever thought about gathering your art into some sort of book and maybe building a narrative &#8211; abstract or otherwise &#8211; to go with the images?</strong></p>
<p>SK: I vaguely have, but I&#8217;ve vaguely thought about lotsa things.</p>
<p>MK: It&#8217;s a nice idea. I like the idea of comic book panels as art (Roy Lichtenstein). I also like the idea of art in graphic book form. But having dabbled in creating comics some years ago I realised it&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks. Too hard basket!</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Thanks for your time guys.</strong></p>
<p>MK: Aren&#8217;t you going to ask us about our new album Steve Kilbey and Martin Kennedy Present <em>Unseen Music Unheard Words</em> which is in music shops and iTunes now?</p>
<p><strong>Comic nerd: Um, no.</strong></p>
