?I was listening to vinyl at the time, just getting into ?70s stuff.? It&#8217;s a pretty stark admission from a guy who&#8217;s just cut one of the most ?70s-referecing records of the year, Eagle And The Worm&#8217;s <em>Good Times</em>. The band&#8217;s lead singer Jarrad Brown is sitting outside Melbourne&#8217;s Greville Records, and he&#8217;s brought along his acoustic guitar. Is this par-for-the-course for every interview?</p>
<p>?Nah,? he smiles, ?I&#8217;m just heading down to Mushroom Publishing afterwards. They&#8217;ve asked us to play some songs from the record, so we&#8217;re trimming down to a sort of mariachi three-piece with upright bass and acoustic guitar.?</p>
<p>A modular approach is probably what&#8217;s required when you front a nine-piece band (the outfit tours as an octet). Birthed on hard drives and 4-track tape machines in Brown&#8217;s Melbourne bedroom in 2009, Eagle And The Worm have since swelled to include his music-playing pals: Richard Bradbeer (bass), Michael Hubbard (guitar), Ben Morrison (synth), Joe Cope (Hammond), Jim Lawrie (drums), Emily Mould (trombone), Liam McGorry (trumpet) and Ross Beaton (baritone sax). Marrying Brown&#8217;s bedroom experiments with a hi-fi studio sound, debut album <em>Good Times</em> was eventually cut with minimal rehearsals over four days in a room in North Fitzroy with producer Steven Schram (Little Red, Cat Empire) and Brown as ?creative director?. Creative director?</p>
<p>?I tell everyone to get to rehearsal and I drive the fucking Tarago,? he jokes.</p>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;ve been sitting on this record for over a year?</strong><br/>
Yeah. <em>Good Times</em> was mostly finished sometime last year, but there was all kind of things happening. I guess you could say I finished the record before I had a band. Then I was like, ?I&#8217;ve got a record. What am I going to do now?? And then I put the band together and started booking shows. It just kept escalating. I had plans to release everything fully independently, but when other people got on board, there were other ideas on how to release it. When the radio got on board and started pushing the tracks, I could see a growing audience. Initially when I was thinking of releasing it myself, the audience I had in mind was so small for this record &#8211; and I was stoked with that. But as things started changing, I sort of wanted to change the set-up of Eagle And The Worm to work with a larger audience. It slowly changed in that respect.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3021218/350x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Whose idea was it to do the 7? releases <a href="/releases/2000580">[?Futureman?/?Goodtimes?</a> and <a href="/releases/2000666">?All I Know?</a>] as a teaser?</strong><br/>
That was mine. That&#8217;s just what I wanted to do. When I wrote the songs, I had a 12? in mind the whole time. I was listening to vinyl at the time, just getting into ?70s stuff, just touching the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, really? Listening to the record, I assumed you had that stuff in your DNA.</strong><br/>
Nah, it&#8217;s weird. It took other people to tell me, ?The ?70s is a big thing for you.? I was always a fan of The Beatles and The Stones?</p>
<p><strong>Growing up in the ?90s, unless your parents had those albums, you weren&#8217;t really exposed to that obscure ?70s stuff. Was that the same for you?</strong><br/>
Mum and dad were pretty daggy. Dire Straits was about as hip as dad got. Me and my brother brought [Guns N? Roses?] <em>Appetite For Destruction</em>, we wagged school. I was probably six. We rode down to Target. When dad found out he took it away. My brother&#8217;s five years older than me, so when I was 14 &#8211; maybe younger &#8211; he was listening to Tom Petty and Hendrix, heaps of Americana, heaps of ?90s stuff. I always cited the ?90s stuff as a big influence on me, but the ?70s things didn&#8217;t spring to mind until I was halfway through the Eagle And The Worm record.</p>
<p><strong>Which record in particular?</strong><br/>
A big one when I was recording was Rod Stewart&#8217;s <em>Atlantic Crossing</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting. Most people say, <em>Every Picture Tells a Story* or *Gasoline Alley</em>.</strong><br/>
For one, the cover&#8217;s really interesting. It&#8217;s him crossing this rainbow and ditching a bottle. It&#8217;s when he went from the UK to the US and went sober as well. It&#8217;s got great rhythm section players. I think Donald ?Duck? Dunn played bass and it&#8217;s got some of the Booker T [&amp; The M.G&#8217;s] dudes. It&#8217;s got awesome grooves, drum sounds. That was a big thing for Eagle And The Worm. Those were the sounds I was going for.</p>
<p><strong>So that inspired you to go away from the home recorded stuff to recruit some players and bash it out in the studio?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Everything I do at home is a cacophony of chaos. There&#8217;s always too many ideas. It&#8217;s all pretty experimental and there&#8217;s a lot of loose ends in what I&#8217;m doing at home. I don&#8217;t really set any guidelines. Taking it into the studio was about getting the chemistry and the players and getting the sense of a great rhythm section on the record, a sense of feel and a sense of groove. When I was making the record, one of the things I wanted to do was a have a jam band, as well as songs, and really meld the two. At the start, I was maybe going for more a jam record, but as it turned out, it was more about songs than anything out.</p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of weird, electronic touches on the record. Did those come after?</strong><br/>
Yeah, a lot of it was post-production sort of stuff. I did heavy editing on the record to get it into shape. I spent a lot of time building the arrangements, just getting all the sounds I wanted, trying to be particular about those kinda things.</p>
<p><strong>The record really does seem like a marriage between the home recorded stuff and the sessions you did with the players.</strong><br/>
I wanted that sort of effect. I wanted a hi-fi-sounding recorded. I really wanted a record that could connect with anyone. I didn&#8217;t want an elite-sounding, experimental record. I wanted it to be for everyone, which was part of the whole <em>Good Times</em> thing as well, just reaching out to people. It was about the marriage of achieving a hi-fi sound that was easy to listen to on the ears, but using all of those home-recorded sounds. Those home-recorded sounds are not that experimental these days. Everyone knows what garage records sound like.</p>
<p><strong>Was Steven [Schram, producer] key to achieving that hi-fi sound?</strong><br/>
Yeah, he was. He was key for a lot of things. He&#8217;s pretty much the only producer I&#8217;ve worked with for the past seven years, since the start of the Custom Kings. I guess it&#8217;s about having that relationship with Steven. That point when we did Eagle And The Worm was really interesting for me, because even to people like Steven, I wasn&#8217;t really a songwriter. I just made all these songs and I was like, ?Steve, let&#8217;s do this record!? For him, it was really fun because he wasn&#8217;t delivering a product for a name band. He did all the things I couldn&#8217;t do, like all the hi-fi stuff &#8211; It was a nice collaboration in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Did he help focus your ideas?</strong><br/>
I brought in the arrangements as they stand &#8211; But Steven&#8217;s a producer, an engineer. He can focus your ideas, take exactly what you&#8217;ve said and make it even clearer. That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s good at. He&#8217;s tasteful as well, with the sounds and tones he gets. I really trust Steven. He&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Does he share that appreciation for that ?70s sound?</strong><br/>
Yeah, he does. That ?70s thing started becoming a bit more apparent as we were doing it. As we were mixing it, we started flipping out on some ?70s records like Rod Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>How did you gather together all the players on the record?</strong><br/>
They&#8217;re all mates. I studied music at Box Hill tafe [in Melbourne], so I met a lot of people there &#8211; They were either people I play in bands with, friends that play in bands, or people I&#8217;ve studied with. I&#8217;m just fortunate in a town like Melbourne, there are so many freakin? good musicians.</p>
<p><strong>And bad ones too.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah, quite a few bad ones.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>When did Eagle And The Worm go from being ?Jarrad Brown and Friends? to an actual band?</strong><br/>
I think our first gig was at The Tote [in Melbourne] in December 2009. For me that was the point when it became a band. I never really considered putting something out as ?The Jarrad Brown Experience?. [<em>Laughs</em>] I wasn&#8217;t quite ready for that. It&#8217;s pretty much the same line-up now [as The Tote gig].</p>
<p><strong>Is it limiting being an eight-piece?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d imagine. It&#8217;s expensive to tour, but other than that, it&#8217;s the same deal. Some places there aren&#8217;t enough PA channels, but big deal. It&#8217;s a live show &#8211; you just deal with it. Occasionally you get a phone call like, ?Oh man, you&#8217;re not going to fit on stage?, but it&#8217;s like, ?Whatever, it&#8217;ll be fine.?</p>
<p><strong>Have your ambitions shifted now?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t think our ambitions have shifted, but I can go about things in different ways. Having a broader support network makes me feel like there&#8217;s opportunities out there. I&#8217;m a big believer in making your own luck. The work you put in is what you get out.</p>
<p><strong>I think I heard ?All I Know? in a breakfast commercial?</strong><br/>
Yeah, Berocca.</p>
<p><strong>Was it always your intention to make an accessible record?</strong><br/>
Definitely, absolutely. What I was saying before about doing that experimental thing at home, writing without boundaries &#8211; for me, it was about taking those ideas and boiling them down into something that would really communicate with anyone. Music is a community art, it&#8217;s for everyone. I want people to hear this record and nod along to it, and beyond that, I wanted something a bit more deep for anyone who really wanted to listen. I wanted an easy listening record, but also something deeper in the songwriting.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I never really considered putting something out as ?The Jarrad Brown Experience?. I wasn&#8217;t quite ready for that.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a sonically adventurous album; almost like a mixtape in a way. Is that reflective of how wide you are as a listener?</strong><br/>
Maybe. I did think about that, but I think it&#8217;s more reflective of a bedroom record type thing. I reckon a lot of bedroom records are like mixtapes. When you go into a big recording studio with your band, that&#8217;s a big filter for what&#8217;s happening: it gets boiled down and you get a straighter-sounding record. But if you record a lot of your stuff at home, you don&#8217;t have that third-party situation and you end up getting a lot of different ideas out there that are loose.</p>
<p><strong>So I guess it&#8217;s a bedroom record made in the studio?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>The press release describes you as the band&#8217;s ?creative director?. What does that entail?</strong><br/>
Everyone who works with us &#8211; from our managers to the label people &#8211; I see them as being in the band. I want everyone to be creative and to be involved, and enjoy working with it. I guess I&#8217;m their benevolent dictator.</p>
<p><strong>Was that the process with the record, too? It sounds like the players were given freedom to add their only little imprint on the record?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it was. The studio sessions were hilarious. We didn&#8217;t rehearse, so some of it sounded terrible, but it was awesome &#8211; and it was that vibe that drove it through. There was definite freedom. Some of the guys that played on the record, you&#8217;d be crazy to tell them what to play. I played that role of creative director in the studio; trying to get the best energy in the room, get everyone feeling good and roll it onto tape.</p>
<p><strong>It must&#8217;ve been incredibly difficult to fit eight people into a song?</strong><br/>
We tailored it for each song; for particular guys to be playing on particular songs, so their sound could find its way onto the record.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s almost like a <em>Pet Sounds</em> approach in a way.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I guess it is. <em>Pet Sounds* is another one of those records &#8211;  obviously, I had heard *Pet Sounds*, but I only bought it midway through demoing Eagle And The Worm. I pretty much wrote ?Too Young? after hearing *Pet Sounds</em>, so that&#8217;s why it sounds like Brian Wilson. That was another one of those records that just came up.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s one thing to try and write a song like Brian Wilson, another thing altogether to really nail that vibe.</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know how that works. Songwriting is a really mystical thing for me &#8211; when you pull it off and when you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m still one of those guys who writes a lot of songs, and a lot don&#8217;t make it across the line. Sometimes I&#8217;ll re-write a song 10 times. That song [?Too Young?], a lot of credit has to go to Ben Morrison, who did the keyboard arrangement. He blew it out of the water for me. He made it a great song. He&#8217;s a massive Brian Wilson fan and an incredible arranger.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Have you started writing new material?</strong><br/>
Yeah. It&#8217;s been a similar process. We&#8217;ve been jamming stuff here and there. I&#8217;ve got a little studio. I just write and write &#8211; not necessarily for Eagle And The Worm &#8211; and slowly boil it down to what we could do. It&#8217;s really loose stream-of-consciousness songwriting at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>I guess you have four projects now [Eagle And The Worm, Custom Kings, Joe Neptune and Your Animal] that you can filter things through?</strong><br/>
Well, it&#8217;s pretty much just Eagle And The Worm for me. Custom Kings and Joe Neptune still exists, but Your Animal is on hiatus. For me, the focus is just Eagle. I&#8217;ve never, ever in my time of being a musician just had one band to focus on. It&#8217;s kinda new.</p>
<p><strong>And one band that&#8217;s your own too?</strong><br/>
Yeah, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>I felt with the last Custom Kings record <a href="/releases/2000726"><em>[The Great Escape</a></em>] that the line between both bands had blurred?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I reckon too. And that&#8217;s cool. My songs &#8211; you could hear they were mine.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Maybe it&#8217;s your voice, too. Have you always been singing?</strong><br/>
Nah, it was just through the Custom Kings, through [frontman] Nick [Vorrath] really. He&#8217;s just a mad fan of songwriting and singing. He was just one of those guys who kept saying, ?You&#8217;ve got to sing. It&#8217;s the funnest thing in the world.? As a kid I was too shy to join the choir. Nick wanted to get everyone singing in the Custom Kings, for the sake of the band, so that&#8217;s how I started singing.</p>
<p><strong>How long ago was this?</strong><br/>
Five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>And Custom Kings was your first band?</strong><br/>
No, before that I was part of The Incredible Dead Goons, which was part of the Melbourne ska scene. We used to play with 99% Fat, Mr Coffee. They were a nine-piece as well, so that&#8217;s where the horn section comes from.</p>
<p><strong>So the tour that&#8217;s coming up in August &#8211; will that be the biggest you&#8217;ve done?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;ll be our album tour. It&#8217;ll be the eight-piece the whole tour, which is the first time we&#8217;ve been able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>What are the logistics involved?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s the same deal, you just have to be more organised &#8211; You can fit eight people in one car, which is a bonus. You borrow backline where you have to. You just have to budget well. It&#8217;s the same as touring with a four- or five-piece, it&#8217;s just a bit more strain on the budget.</p>
<p><strong>Is overseas a possibility?</strong><br/>
We haven&#8217;t actually booked any dates, but there&#8217;s something in the pipeline &#8211; But I don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on in America, or the UK, or anywhere. I&#8217;d love to know, and I&#8217;d love to be there doing it. I want to have a sustainable life out of putting out records and doing shows, so I guess making the rest of the world part of it is probably key.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>####Eagle And The Worm&#8217;s &#8216;Good Times&#8217; is out now through Cotillion/Warner Music Australia. It&#8217;ll be launched at Cherry Bar in Melbourne tonight (June 9), with a national tour slated for August.</p>
