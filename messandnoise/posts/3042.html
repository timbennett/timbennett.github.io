                <h3>One of only two Australian bands ever signed to England&#8217;s iconic pop label Sarah, The Sugargliders thrived for four years before Josh and Joel Meadows moved on. Thanks to a new retrospective, they look back with <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032291/440x690-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The Sugargliders never put out an album. They didn&#8217;t need to. It was all there on the 7?s: 10 of them in just four years, all stamped with the same imperfect font on the front. The first three were for Summershine, the Melbourne pop label that paired local bands like The Earthmen and Ripe with international singles from Lilys, Seam and Velocity Girl. But what secured Josh and Joel Meadows? band an international following was releasing six singles with the iconic English label Sarah Records, whose output was clutched tightly to the chests of the devoted while many others scoffed at it for perceived twee characteristics. (The only other Aussie band on Sarah was Even As We Speak.) </p>
<p>After that formative and prolific stint with The Sugargliders, the Meadows brothers turned to The Steinbecks, a more full-band concern that&#8217;s still going. But The Sugargliders continue to hold a special place in people&#8217;s hearts, partly for the purity of releasing only 7?s but mostly for the quality and sincerity of the songwriting. Presaging the likes of <a href="/icons/3714981">The Lucksmiths</a> &#8211; whose singer/drummer Tali White is the Meadows? cousin &#8211; the band paved the way for Australian guitar-pop bands that could sing with their natural accents, avoid all that cliched rock&#8217;n?roll bravado and still find loyal fans in unlikely corners of the globe.</p>
<p>Those singles are long out of print, of course, but the new retrospective <em><a href="http://popboomerangrecords.bandcamp.com/album/pb085-the-sugargliders-a-nest-with-a-view-1990-1994">A Nest With a View 1990-1994</a></em> on Popboomerang collects the band&#8217;s 20 best songs &#8211; in their eyes. It cuts across their many different configurations, whether just acoustic and electric guitar or with bass, drums or drum machine. (In addition to Ripe&#8217;s Mark Murphy, The Jordans? Adam Dennis and The Earthmen&#8217;s Robert Cooper recording and/or playing with the band, The Avalanches? Darren Seltmann drummed for both The Sugargliders and The Steinbecks at times.) It&#8217;s an ideal primer in every way, bottling that sensitivity of delivery and content with the pristine twang of Joel&#8217;s Aztec Camera-influenced acoustic guitar leads.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t sense that Aztec Camera link, or the spectre of fellow Postcard Records legend Orange Juice, Josh and Joel are all too quick to point it out. When interviewed at the Bridge Hotel in regional Victoria&#8217;s Castlemaine &#8211; where both brothers are based now &#8211; the Meadows are not just incredibly good-natured in general but quite vocal about the influence of those two bands, Sarah labelmates The Field Mice and others. But that&#8217;s not to downplay the greatness of those classic Sugargliders tunes: from ?Ahprahran? to ?Police Me?, these are some of the best guitar-pop songs that Australia produced in the ?90s or, well, ever.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3032294/400x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The Meadows brothers were at the Bridge for a warm-up gig for The Steinbecks, who will soon revisit the Sugargliders catalogue live with heaps of old friends joining the tribute. That said, seeing them live &#8211; a quartet with bassist-keyboardist Matthew Sigley (The Lovetones, Belles Will Ring) and drummer Joel Sprake &#8211; was a reminder that the Meadows boys are still penning sharp, smart, catchy pop songs. There&#8217;s a new Steinbecks album coming next year, in fact, and the pure spirit of The Sugargliders very much carries on in their work today.</p>
<p><strong>The record starts with ?Ahprahran?, which was on the Sarah Records compilation <em>There &amp; Back Again Lane</em>. Is that a big song for you guys?</strong><br/>
Josh: It&#8217;s definitely our most well-known song. It was recorded when we were in England in 1992. We only ever went to England once, for a short tour in November/December ?92. We were fortunate enough to record that song and two others with Ian Catt, who produced Field Mice and quite a bit of Saint Etienne. We just recorded out of his house, and it was quite a modest setup, but he was a man who had great sensibility about sounds. It was a thrill for us to record with him, because we loved other records he&#8217;d produced. The song, of course, is about Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>What about Prahran inspired it?</strong><br/>
Joel: I&#8217;d been working at the student union at the Prahran college. It was a particularly tricky year, because basically the college was being taken over by two educational institutions and the student union was getting kind of ripped art.</p>
<p><strong>Is that the ?big fish swallows small again? thing?</strong><br/>
Joel: Yeah, so it was a real case of watching this pretty alive college in suburban Melbourne with a really strong arts faculty and design and lots of interesting stuff as well as the TAFE sector &#8211; it was basically just getting shafted. That was some of the inspiration for the song.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>On that subject, it looks like there&#8217;s an RMIT connection to the band, seeing where a lot of the songs were recorded.</strong><br/>
Joel: Well, I was at Prahran and he was at RMIT.</p>
<p>Josh: We had friends who were doing a media studies course and could use the studio in the basement of Building 6.</p>
<p>Joel: And as we had absolutely no money, it was a good way to multi-track recordings. So our very first stuff was done there.</p>
<p><strong>So you put out stuff on Summershine first and then Sarah?</strong><br/>
Josh: Yeah. We did three 7?s on Summershine when it was just a fledgling label. Then we did one for Marineville, an English label from Brighton, and six with Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>Who was behind Summershine?</strong><br/>
Josh: This guy called Jason Reynolds. He used to run a record shop [Exposure Records] in Kew. Just this little indie shop where he&#8217;d have a New Releases table with all the new 7?s from labels like Bus Stop, Subway and Slumberland, as well as 4AD, Factory and Sarah. It was a great shop. It was a real magnet for indie kids in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-internet, I imagine it was a huge thing to have that sort of hub.</strong><br/>
Josh: Yeah, it was really important. At one point Jason decided to start his own label. Ours was the fourth single on the label [1990?s ?Sway?]. He did some really good stuff, and gave a chance to us when I don&#8217;t think anyone would have taken any notice. So we&#8217;re grateful to him for giving us a start. Our early singles were not well recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still in touch with him?</strong><br/>
Josh: He lives in the USA and is married to an American. We&#8217;ve had a bit of contact with him just in the process of putting this compilation together.</p>
<p><strong>So people were going to this record store and buying records from these labels, but it must have still been a pretty cult thing. When you signed to Sarah, was it like a huge deal to you but not many other people knew what it meant?</strong><br/>
Josh: We were absolutely thrilled, because we&#8217;d become fans of particularly The Field Mice and The Orchids and Another Sunny Day. We sent our Summershine singles to Sarah Records, just so they knew what we were doing, with the hope that one day we would produce something that was worthy of their label. And when we recorded ?Letter From a Lifeboat??</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4C4n1xw8FeU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Joel: We did pull out all the stops with that, though, so there was a real feeling of &#8211; we&#8217;d been doing the same thing for a while. We&#8217;d been playing the same kind of venues, we&#8217;d put out three singles through Summershine, we were recording at the same places. When we wrote that song, we really wanted to take it up a notch. And I think if it had just kept on going in the same way, we probably would have wound things up earlier than we did. So there was a real sense of, ?Let&#8217;s throw a fair bit at this.? We went into a bigger studio [C&#8217;est Ca]. You can hear the production is improved, but also we&#8217;d been playing a whole lot more together, so I suppose we were starting to actually get better at doing it. Better at crafting songs.</p>
<p>The single before that [?Another Faux Pas in the Cathedral of Love?], we started to experiment with not just performing what we did live and recording it, but layering sounds and realising that the recorded artefact is such a different thing to live. So we started to do things that we couldn&#8217;t then reproduce live. Occasionally we&#8217;d write songs that would never get performed. Things like ?Theme From Boxville?, on the B-side of ?Ahprahran?: I think we did that two or three times [live, when] we could actually pull in enough people to perform it. </p>
<p>So it marked something for us. It was different. And then actually sending the record off to Sarah and then getting the call back [about] putting it out was such a buzz. [<em>Laughs</em>]  </p>
<p>Josh: The label for us wasn&#8217;t just a pop label, but a label that had some very strong ideas. They were ones that were close to our hearts as well. It was a record company that essentially didn&#8217;t want anything to do with the music business. Didn&#8217;t want to be involved with the industry at all. It just wanted to find great songs and unleash them on the world.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032292/400x360-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>There&#8217;s a real common thread to the bands on Sarah, no matter where they&#8217;re from. East River Pipe and your stuff and the English bands: some of the guitar playing is almost this conversation with each other.</strong><br/>
Josh: I think it attracted people from all over the place too, because it did have this sound. But also an aesthetic, the way the sleeves had a bit of a feel about them. And also the politics of Sarah: I think it attracted certain people. Getting back to your original question from before, we were absolutely thrilled to be on the label. But it wasn&#8217;t a very well-known thing in Melbourne. Some people liked us and maybe a few more people liked us because of Sarah?</p>
<p>Joel: It didn&#8217;t make a big difference in Melbourne. So there was always that thing of who was coming to our shows and then the international thing. We sold far more records in Japan than we ever sold in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>What were the shows like? What was the scene like then?</strong><br/>
Josh: It was a pretty healthy live scene in Melbourne. I think Melbourne&#8217;s still got a very healthy live scene. It was like that then. The venues have changed in a lot of cases, but it was really healthy. There were labels like Summershine that were encouraging young bands to be playing. Sometimes we played with some of those bands, like The Earthmen and Autohaze. Then there were others, like The Fish John West Reject, which were guys who had come from Tasmania. They played some rip-roaring shows. Ripe started on Summershine and then signed to Beggars Banquet in the UK and did an amazing album called <em>The Plastic Hassle</em>.</p>
<p>Joel: We played a lot of shows with Girl of the World, which was the band <a href="/icons/4069329">Bart [Cummings]</a> was originally in.</p>
<p>Josh: And also The Glory Box. There was quite a lot of bands that were kindred spirits.</p>
<p>Joel: And the shows were crazy. [<em>Laughs</em>] In particular for record launches, it was always a bit of fun. We&#8217;d always try to do stuff a bit over the top.</p>
<p>Josh: Guest musicians and projectors and nets strewn across the stage.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It wasn&#8217;t rock ?n? roll and it didn&#8217;t have that rock attitude. But everything else was fair game &#8211; What was really important to us was that the words were really honest and political and genuine.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How did the Sugargliders sound develop? Especially that almost Spanish twang to the guitar.</strong><br/>
Joel: Early on it was just me on acoustic guitar and Josh and I singing. Josh doing the lead vocal and a lot of unison vocals. But then, particularly by the time we started recording, Josh was playing electric guitar and I was playing acoustic. A lot of those songs, he was playing rhythm and I was playing lead. The thing that really defined The Sugargliders was, rather than having the electric guitar playing lead and the rhythm being played by acoustic, we had that the different way around.</p>
<p>Josh: It sort of came about by accident, because I was only learning to play the instrument and I found it a lot easier to play chords. Joel was more advanced than me, so he would play the sort of Spanish leads. So whereas a lot of bands would have a strummed acoustic and an electric lead, we had it the other way around. It just created something a bit different.</p>
<p>Joel: At times I listen back to it and go, ?Gee, it&#8217;s a bit harsh sometimes,? but it had something to it. The other thing was that after we started playing with the two guitars, we played with a drummer but no bass. So there&#8217;s a few songs and singles, and we played quite a few shows, as a three-piece with drums and two guitars. Then we stopped playing with a bass player but started playing with a drum machine. [<em>Laughs</em>] So it went through a few different incarnations. It was what we were writing and how it worked. It wasn&#8217;t like we were changing line-ups all the time; it was just sort of this gentle progression where we added instruments and changed the sound.</p>
<p>Josh: I don&#8217;t think it would be honest of us to talk about your acoustic guitar style without mentioning [Aztec Camera&#8217;s] Roddy Frame.</p>
<p>Joel: That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><strong>He&#8217;s mentioned in one of the songs, isn&#8217;t he?</strong><br/>
Joel: He is: ?Just like Roddy said/It&#8217;s there until it goes away? [from ?Police Me?]. He went <em>so</em> commercial [later], so by the time we were playing, his stuff was so mainstream. But his early stuff was just unbelievable. He was 16 when he recorded some of those early Postcard singles. His playing and his lyrics were just unbelievable for someone so young.</p>
<p>Josh: And certainly his style of playing acoustic guitar was influential.</p>

<strong>How did you discover him? Was it a record store thing, or community radio?</strong><br/>
Josh: 3RRR was really important. There was a number of good shows that would play imported records a week after they came out in London or New York. That was some essential listening. You could buy the <em>NME* and *Melody Maker</em> for a fortune, which I did. I had a big stack of them that I had to get rid of when I moved house in 1999.</p>
<p>Joel: Josh had a show on the student radio at RMIT too. We&#8217;d often listen to the tapes of those shows.</p>
<p>Josh: I think that&#8217;s where I first came across Orange Juice. That record library had <em>You Can&#8217;t Hide Your Love Forever</em>, which &#8211; what an album.</p>
<p>Joel: [Flying Nun] stuff was really influential for us too. The Chills and The Bats particularly.</p>
<p><strong>How did the drum machine happen?</strong><br/>
Joel: It probably happened primarily because we were going to England, and our drummer [Marc Fulker] couldn&#8217;t come with us. At about the same time, Robert Cooper, who played bass, came into Exposure Records and met Josh there. I was playing in another band [Prevention] that had a drum machine, and I had access to it. I thought if we were going to England &#8211; we didn&#8217;t want to completely lose the drum stuff.</p>
<p>Josh: I think we were also emboldened by The Field Mice. Here was a band who were making beautiful music with a drum machine. Suddenly it occurred to us that it might be possible for it not to sound clinical or cold.</p>
<p><strong>What was that trip to England like? How long were you there?</strong><br/>
Josh: We were only there for 36 days, but we did a lot of gigs in that time. And we recorded two singles: one with Ian Catt and another with Jyoti Mishra from White Town, the guy who had a massive hit [in 1997 with ?Your Woman?].</p>
<p>Joel: He recorded that on the same eight-track tape deck that we recorded on. I remember when he sent the demo of that across to us. I remember listening to it in the car and going, ?This is <em>really* good. If only it got picked up by the radio stations, this would go number one.? [*Laughs</em>] And it did, for a change.</p>
<p>Josh: Matt [Haynes] and Clare [Wadd] from Sarah were very good in helping us set up a number of gigs. That&#8217;s not the record label&#8217;s job at all, but because we didn&#8217;t have a manager or an agent or anything, they lined up a whole bunch of shows for us.</p>
<p>Joel: Mostly with other Sarah bands.</p>
<p>Josh: So we played a couple of gigs in London and then Oxford, Reading, Bristol, Leeds, Sheffield. We played with Blueboy, Secret Shine, Brighter, Heavenly. It was just terrific to be able to play with these bands.</p>
<p>Joel: It was funny: back when we did this stuff, big acts toured but small acts really didn&#8217;t. But that really shifted over the ?90s, to the point where it&#8217;s not unusual for an obscure band to do a world tour [now].</p>
<p><strong>Were you covered in the English press?</strong><br/>
Josh: Once we were on Sarah, our stuff got reviewed in <em>NME* and *Melody Maker</em>. And we had a couple of live reviews when we were playing England.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032295/299x299-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>How did The Sugargliders end and The Steinbecks begin?</strong><br/>
Josh: I guess we felt like the sort of songs we were writing called for a bigger ?band? sound. Sugargliders had always been a smaller thing. Even though we had begun to expand the sound quite significantly, we still felt a little bit burdened with the ?acoustic duo? tag.</p>
<p>Joel: Also, at some point I&#8217;m sure Josh said flippantly &#8211; but it got recorded &#8211; that Sugargliders wouldn&#8217;t put out an album unless it was as good as <em>You Can&#8217;t Hide Your Love Forever*. And that basically meant that we couldn&#8217;t make an album. [*Laughs</em>] We were locked into only making singles, so we had to get rid of The Sugargliders and start a new band so we could put out some albums.</p>
<p>Josh: It was a pretty smooth transition from one band to the other. Sometimes I feel a little bit regretful that we didn&#8217;t just let The Sugargliders evolve, like a lot of bands do evolve. But in another way I&#8217;m glad we were sort of purists about it and left it as just these four years &#8211; just these 10 7? singles &#8211; and then moved on to something else.</p>
<p><strong>How many songs are there that aren&#8217;t on the new collection?</strong><br/>
Josh: There&#8217;s 20 songs on the album that&#8217;s just been released, but there were 30 songs on the 7?s. There were also a few odds and ends.</p>
<p>Joel: There&#8217;s two tapes [as well]. [<em>To Josh*]: I know you&#8217;ve got them. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Is anything going to happen with those other songs?</strong><br/>
Josh: No, I feel like <em>A Nest With a View</em> compiles the best 20 songs &#8211; a representative 20 songs from across the four years. But also, because we are 7? fans, we&#8217;ve tried to only take one or two songs from each of the 7?s. So people who have got the original artefact still have something a bit special. We haven&#8217;t stuck to that entirely, because there&#8217;s all three songs from ?Trumpet Play? and all three from ?Top 40 Sculpture?.</p>
<p><strong>That factor aside, was it hard to chose those 20 songs and leave off the rest?</strong><br/>
Joel: No, it was really hard to <em>get* 20 songs. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Josh: There are some good songs that aren&#8217;t on it, like ?Strong? [B-side to ?Letter From a Lifeboat?].</p>
<p>Joel: There was a bit of listening to the really early stuff and going, ?Do we really want to put that out there?? Not just [for] embarrassment, but a sense [that] we&#8217;ve just moved on so much. But then some of the songs, listening to them again, actually moved me again.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>You mentioned ?Trumpet Play?: that&#8217;s a funkier song, with the wah guitar. Is there a story behind that side of the band?</strong><br/>
Joel: I suppose we liked dancey kind of stuff and we liked funk guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Some of that Orange Juice stuff is really funk- and soul-influenced.</strong><br/>
Joel: Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t what we were listening to most of the time, although there was a bit of that dance stuff coming out. </p>
<p>Josh: There was a Melbourne band, I&#8217;m Talking [featuring Kate Ceberano and members of Essendon Airport]. They had big hits in Australia. Funky guitars, really danceable. They used to put on these really belting live shows as well. So I guess that&#8217;s where that dancier side came from.</p>
<p><strong>People who aren&#8217;t into indie pop or Sarah can think it&#8217;s all just twee or whatever, but this collection really shows a lot of different facets of the band.</strong><br/>
Josh: The Orchids were doing some really dancey stuff.</p>
<p>Joel: Yeah, they were. And The Field Mice too: ?Missing the Moon?.</p>
<p>Josh: Although the dance stuff they were doing was a lot more techno.</p>
<p>Joel: I think for us, it wasn&#8217;t rock&#8217;n?roll and it didn&#8217;t have that rock attitude. But everything else was fair game. It wasn&#8217;t like we had strict rules about what was allowed and what wasn&#8217;t. What was really important to us was that the words were really honest and political and genuine. And we weren&#8217;t great musicians, but there wasn&#8217;t a sense of trying to be showy with what we were doing. It was about trying to make sounds together that had a cohesion and in particular supported what the songs were about.</p>
<p><strong>Who wrote the lyrics? Was it both of you?</strong><br/>
Joel: Mostly it was me writing the music and Josh writing the words.</p>
<p><strong>And you sang lead, Josh?</strong><br/>
Josh: Mostly, yeah.</p>
<p>Joel: But we both crossed over a bit. Generally we had power of veto over both things, so we&#8217;d share our ideas. Sometimes I&#8217;d have a tune and a line or two that I&#8217;d give to Josh.</p>
<p>Josh: So ?Ahprahran?, the story grew out of Joel&#8217;s lived experience, but I wrote most of the song.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m curious about the lyrics of ?Police Me? [?We&#8217;ve been called immature??], and whether that&#8217;s based on something someone actually said about the band.</strong><br/>
Josh: I think we did feel like we were putting ourselves out there with our lyrics, and that that was the right thing to do. And that, even if we came across a bit embarrassing or unsubtle, it was worth doing that if you were being honest about what you believe in. That song&#8217;s sort of about that stuff, and about that struggle of wanting to sing about social issues without sounding like you&#8217;re preaching. [?But I&#8217;ll write songs about injustice if that is what I see, all around.?]</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/N2Z0cV9NIt8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>I think that&#8217;s what helps these songs hold up. If it was just ?There&#8217;s a girl I like and I have a crush on her,? I don&#8217;t think it would have such an enduring quality.</strong><br/>
Josh: We&#8217;ve written those songs as well. [<em>Laughter</em>]</p>
<p>Joel: But not too many of them. And I always felt like the boxing of Sarah Records in that twee pop thing &#8211; that never sat comfortably with me. We&#8217;ve never tried to do what we do to be cute. It might be beautiful, but it&#8217;s not intentionally cutesy.</p>
<p>Josh: Just some of the raw emotion in some of the Field Mice stuff: how can that be described as twee? Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=Cs0X7HXM538">?Song Six?</a> and the lyrics of that song: that&#8217;s so powerful. That&#8217;s not twee.</p>
<p>Joel: People who liked it maybe copied it and it might have come out sounding like that, but I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p><strong>I did an interview like this with <a href="/icons/3714981">The Lucksmiths</a> when they called it a day, but I just realised again that Tali [White] is your cousin. Was it interesting to see The Lucksmiths come about and tour the States and get more acceptance for something in quite a similar vein to what you were doing?</strong><br/>
Josh: It was terrific. But for the record, they played their first gig supporting us. [<em>Laughter</em>] Right from the word go, they were so entertaining. The dynamic between them was just superb. It&#8217;s been a thrill to see them go so well, and be able to tour and get followers all over the world. And they&#8217;ve been a lot more dedicated than we ever were. They&#8217;ve done a lot of hard work we never did. And they&#8217;re terrific songwriters.</p>
<blockquote><p>?They&#8217;re very much young men&#8217;s songs, and I hate seeing old men sing young men&#8217;s songs.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the output been like over the years for The Steinbecks?</strong><br/>
Josh: We&#8217;ve been a lot slower. When we were in The Sugargliders, we&#8217;d just churn stuff out. Whatever we were thinking of, we&#8217;d just record it and get it released on a 7?. Whereas we tend to take a long time over things with The Steinbecks. But we have released three full-length albums and two EPs, and we&#8217;ve got another album [mostly] finished. So we&#8217;re a lot slower, but we&#8217;ve actually released more stuff as The Steinbecks than we ever did as The Sugargliders.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2l6h2UpTfYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>I know for the launch you&#8217;re playing as The Steinbecks, but was there talk of doing something as The Sugargliders?</strong><br/>
Joel: No, we were really clear from the start [about that].</p>
<p>Josh: They&#8217;re very much young men&#8217;s songs, and I hate seeing old men sing young men&#8217;s songs. [<em>Laughter</em>] We&#8217;re not reforming The ?Gliders.</p>
<p>Joel: We&#8217;re still doing stuff with The Steinbecks, and that as a project is different to The Sugargliders. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing now, and we want to keep doing it.</p>
<p><strong>When I interviewed The Lucksmiths, I asked them about singing with an audible Australian accent. Were very many other bands doing that at the time?</strong><br/>
Joel: Almost none of them were. I think that&#8217;s something else that defines the Sugargliders sound. I can think of almost no bands who were playing at the time who sounded very Australian.</p>
<p><strong>Was it a conscious thing, or just that you sang that way and didn&#8217;t want to change it or hide it?</strong><br/>
Joel: I really disliked people putting on American accents to sing, unless they were American. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Josh: It was the whole thing of wanting to be genuine. If we&#8217;re singing about stuff that&#8217;s close to our hearts, we should be singing it in our real voices. Not putting on a phony voice. There&#8217;s a lot of Australian bands in the last 10 years who almost put on this phony Australian voice. I just want people to sing in their natural voice. I want them to be real.</p>
