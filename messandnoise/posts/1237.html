                <h3>Rather than the usual tour diary, Sydney iconoclast <strong>NATHAN ROCHE</strong> frames his debut European tour as a medical report charting his band&#8217;s declining physical and mental wellness.
</h3>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3040001/640x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>The Nathan Roche Band (Greg Clennar, Tristan Winston Price and myself) somehow pulled together a small European tour in June/July 2014 after laughing about the possibility of it a few months earlier. After getting contacts mostly through rock ?n? roll veterans <a href="/articles/4125512">The Holy Soul</a>, we received a total of six replies from possibly 37 emails.</p>
<p>Having only experienced a few shows in a row before in Australia, here is a medical assessment of how we functioned physically and mentally for two weeks together. </p>
<p>Be glad there weren&#8217;t more shows; otherwise you might have needed a bookmark.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Paris  </h2>
<p>The city of love apparently, but in the district of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9nilmontant">M&#8217;nilmontant</a> it was the city of grunge and kebab outlets. Parisian rocker Dimi Dero helped us book a show at La F&#8217;line and when we got there the staff were like cast members from <em>Grease</em>. They had slicked black hair and denim jackets with La F&#8217;line patch logos on the back. It was a notorious rockabilly bar once upon a time, but now it was an empty room with no stage. Greg was arriving on a bus from London after flying in the night before and he almost didn&#8217;t make it. When he made his triumphant arrival 10 minutes before we had to play, he said he hadn&#8217;t slept for three days. His eyes said it all but his bass skills were surprisingly intact.</p>
<p>There were no supports and no one in attendance for the first show. The bar staff were less than impressed by the turnout and sat at the bar death-staring us the whole time with a look of anger and dissatisfaction. Tristan&#8217;s girlfriend Kate and three of our friends watched from the sidelines like anxious supporters of the team at the bottom of the ladder. When the first out-of-tune chord was struck, the expressions on their faces were worth the trip. It was as if the high school prankster had played a small clip of pornography at an innocent girl&#8217;s 18th birthday party in the life montage reel mid-speeches. Towards the end we covered ?Louie Louie? and a group of drunks came in and kept screaming ?Violence! Violence!? with clenched fists for some absurd reason. After the show they bought records and said in broken English, ?THIS IS LAZY ROCK ?N? ROLL!? We then went and drank bottles of wine by the Eiffel Tower. A Frenchman came up to us and said Paris was the saddest city in the world and then recited a lengthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Cendrars">Blaise Cendrars</a> poem. If Blaise Cendrars wasn&#8217;t one of my all-time heroes, I would have been more disgusted by the clich? of poetry by the famous monument. </p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Tired, confused by the language, keen for French lager. More excited than usual.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> A little hungry, very positive, a little worried about money, seems somewhat healthy possibly due to the thrill of travel.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Motivated by the late-coming punters and their comment of ?lazy rock ?n? roll,? wants a La F&#8217;line jacket but somewhat convinced the whole tour will be a failure. Stricken with the usual self-doubt ?creative types? get.</p>
<p/>
<h2>London  </h2>
<p>We caught a very expensive train to London, not realising it would be more than the Sydney-to-Newcastle rail, which takes the same amount of time. To my disgust they didn&#8217;t accept the Centrelink half-fare concessions for the tickets. We tried to remain optimistic that we&#8217;d fall into wealth and hit the Britpop charts as the biggest thing since Oasis to cover the costs. We went to the TATE Modern, I got lost on the Surrealist floor then we went and drank pints. <a href="http://mickeygloss.bandcamp.com/">Mickey Gloss</a>, an Australian expat, booked the show at Birds Nest and also played a ripper set, as did <a href=" http://lonesomeheights.bandcamp.com/">Lonesome Heights</a>. Supports make you feel less lonely. The night was fun and felt like a Melbourne pub, but with a funny accent. I sold two records to a Brit for 10 quid, thinking it was a hot deal. Greg later claimed that it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039998/640x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Tristan&#8217;s girlfriend (the spiritual leader of the group) got very drunk and nearly passed out. Naturally, her being the spiritual leader, we followed her guidance like Jonestown and swallowed. The next day we stayed in a palace in Kensington (fancy district) where some of Tristan&#8217;s family were based and we lived the high life for one glorious night. We worked out that to catch the metro two stops costs about twelve Australian dollars and so it was best to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Misses his girlfriend, starting to worry about transport costs digging into his Popfrenzy savings, still a little bit jetlagged. Noticeable signs of occasional agitation. Homesickness.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> Confident in knowing his way around, feels good about the snare sound, walks the streets with a swagger and claims that only Euro-Tristan wears a watch. Sensitive, but by odd, unexpected things.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Wondering who won the trivia at The Old Fitzroy last Wednesday and dealing with the hardships of being landlocked. Curious that such a rugged delightful mess like Tristan has family in one of the wealthiest suburbs in London. </p>
<p/>
<h2>Brussels  </h2>
<p>We took a day off from our hectic touring schedule in Brussels and ate mussels because Lonely Planet told us to. Tristan was obsessed with the place; wouldn&#8217;t stop banging on about it. ?Brussels is the best, Brussels is my homeland, god look at those trees, the buildings! The colours, the churches, Brussels, Brussels, Brussels, etc.? Besides his obsession, I soon became aware that Tristan was consistently impressive when it came to locating destinations and reading maps. This inspired the song ?No One Knows Direction Like Tristan Winston Price?, to be sung in a fast, country-tinged style, preferably with bluegrass banjo. </p>
<p>We looked for a hire car to drive to the south of France and discovered that it would have been cheaper if we organised it well in advance on the internet. Due to the nature of the tour and the idiot who organised it (me), nothing was well thought out or planned. It&#8217;s the story of my life and you are all welcome to read it. I got a photo outside the Jacques Brel museum, we looked at records we couldn&#8217;t buy, went to parks, drank some more, drove south.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Impressed by the mussels, misses surfing in Bondi, wonders why I couldn&#8217;t book a show in Brussels. A master of impersonations, can mimic anyone he meets in a hilarious manner (obviously once they&#8217;ve left the room).<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> Relentless in conversation and doesn&#8217;t change moods often, if ever. Remains an opinionated steamroller that reviews his surroundings no-holds-barred.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Ready to head back to France for the food, contemplating the purpose of touring in a continent where no one knows who you are and with zero promotion. Also busy figuring out the percentage increase of tobacco intake per day while traveling and formulating it into a bar graph.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Roy&#8217;re-de-Vassivi&#8217;re  </h2>
<p>Bury me here! Behold the promised land. Dimi Dero hooked this one up. It&#8217;s a national park in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy%C3%A8re-de-Vassivi%C3%A8re">middle of nowhere</a> and everyone I&#8217;ve told in France hadn&#8217;t even heard of it. Yes, it&#8217;s paradise alright: green valleys stretching as far as the eye can see and a huge lake nearby. We rolled into the tiny town and soon discovered that it was run by peace-loving organic hippies. Nearby was an anarchist commune; crust punks and dreadlocked loons came out to watch. The opening act was a one-man avant-garde theatrical performance which involved juggling and screaming French in commando attire. Later he removed most of his clothes, took the crowd outside and opened a briefcase full of dirt and threw it everywhere while dancing in a fountain outside the bar. We provided the background music with improvised tables and chairs as percussion while he did. It was one of the strangest things I&#8217;ve ever seen or taken part in. The show was well attended, probably because there wasn&#8217;t anything else happening in the tiny community. They gave us more money than Royal Headache got for playing with the Buzzcocks and we played four encores with the same song twice. That night we slept in a haunted abandoned school down the street in side-by-side beds like the cartoon <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline<em>(TV</em>series">Madeline</a>)</em>. Tristan claimed he could hear soft, eerie techno music playing through the walls.  </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039999/640x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Impressed by the landscape, getting drained by Tristan&#8217;s endless rants and social paranoia, sick of cold wet sandwiches from the service stations. Losing his colour a bit. Bags under the eyes.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> Hands firmly on the steering wheel and taking control, worried that they might not sell cigarettes in such a small town, perhaps becoming secretly psychotic by hearing noises yet disguises it well. He is in desperate need of a shower and personal hygiene attendance.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Wishing he could rent one of the cabins outside of town and be done with music. This thought would change almost instantly when a good song came on the radio. Typically scattered in life decisions. Need for alternative sensation and isolation from the backseat of a moving car.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Chalon Sur Saone  </h2>
<p>The next morning we headed to Chalon Sur Saone and played at The Purple Bar. There weren&#8217;t any supports but it didn&#8217;t matter &#8211; the owners of the bar were bona fide rock ?n? roll legends and fed us a large dinner at five minutes past midnight. They were the classic rock couple in the way that Fred and Toody from Dead Moon are. Genuine, rugged beauty with a one-track mind. A few people turned out, including a somewhat vocal older man who would yell out his review of the track once it was finished. Like a king giving his approval/disapproval or Robert Ebert giving two thumbs up or down. I fell in love with a woman and the sound guy pulled me aside and told me she didn&#8217;t like men. Then later that night I saw him talking to her seductively and they ended up leaving together. I accepted defeat by the trickster, as you could always forgive a charismatic Frenchman.</p>
<p>Another girl, who was apparently a horse rider, wanted to buy my R.M. Williams at whatever the cost, but I told her these boots were the only things I had and they were made for walking. I sold some books to people who couldn&#8217;t speak English and then we drove to the country estate of the owners and stayed there for the night drinking red wine from Burgundy. Tristan and Greg later claimed that I was ranting that night like a madman descending into oblivion, slurring out the only French words I knew with my head on the kitchen table. Apparently it was quite the scene, or so I am told. It was then Greg decided that we needed to go straight to Dubrovnik after the tour. He booked the flights with his smartphone at four in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Starting to slow down, working up a taste for burgundy red wine, contemplates living the quite life in the country. Healthy meal brings back his colour. Realises he is nothing without <a href="http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/frango-petersham-charcoal-chicken-petersham">Frango Portuguese Chicken</a> in Petersham, so the country dream is scratched.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> Getting people in Australia to wire him money. Eyes looking a little rugged but keeping everyone in line and focused. Fed up with tuning my guitar and organising amp settings ?cause I never learnt how. Unsurprisingly, pissed off but not to the point of hostility.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Thinking about Croatia and the landscape but at the same time falling into the rhythmic pattern of drive, set up, drink and eat. Needs to stop giving records away for free when drunk. Thrilled to be meeting people outside of a backpackers hostel, unlike the last time he was in Europe. Inspired; wide-eyed and motivated. Still, business skills require improvement.</p>

<h2>Luxembourg</h2>
<p>We dropped Kate, our spiritual leader, at the airport in Paris and drove north to Luxembourg. I was interested to see how the dynamic would change. For the first few hours, Luxembourg was more or less a terrible experience. The whole place felt like one big modern bank, a bank we didn&#8217;t have any money invested in. We were, however, excited because that night we were playing with our Australian friends Scott &amp; Charlene&#8217;s Wedding and I hadn&#8217;t seen them play since Camperdown &amp; Out supported them in Sydney with Low Life and The BWBBs at The Red Rattler. We got to the venue, which was an underground cave. When SACW arrived in a van that looked like something Iron Maiden would use, they told us their tales of 40-odd shows and I started to feel completely insignificant in comparison.</p>
<p>Tristan said, ?God I feel like I&#8217;ve been away for a lifetime.? I nudged him and told him to pipe down cause it makes us sound like complete pansies and I didn&#8217;t want to look like an fool in front of guitar goddess Gill Tucker. Members of SACW were calm, relaxed and at ease. They were seasoned warriors of the road and completely unfazed by the routine. Joe, from Bedroom Suck, on drums, however, did look like he was one of the last tribe members left towards the season finale of <em>Survivor</em>. We ate another hearty meal with the promoters and then that night stayed in a artist retreat, which was another cave but built into a mountain at the bottom of Luxembourg. It was ASTOUNDING and better than the Ritz Carlton. I also realised that in Europe when you tour, even playing to not many people you are treated like royalty. Not to name venues, but experiences on the live circuit in Sydney where you didn&#8217;t get paid a cent, where you brought all your equipment and sound guy and all you were given was one lousy drink ticket for an eight-dollar VB. </p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Happy to see familiar faces, confused by the SACW tour manager who proposed the question, ?How long do I have to suck your dick for to get a slice of your pizza? after just meeting him over dinner. He is somewhat shaken by the light-hearted but poorly worded comment.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> Experiencing life without girlfriend on tour, which is more or less the same thing but with more dirty jokes. Seems a little more liberated and reckless.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Proud of the guest appearance with SACW singing ?Footscray Station?. Craig and the others are surprised I remember his lyrics and not my own. My fear of memory loss fades away temporarily. A little bitter about treatment to Australian musicians by venues, but not caring as much as Kim Salmon.</p>

<h2>Berlin  </h2>
<p>We dropped the hire car back in Brussels. The rental place tried to rip us off with the kilometres we&#8217;d done and Greg and I assumed this was because we made a fuss that we couldn&#8217;t pay with cash and we offended the clerk jokingly while he was out the back. He heard us and didn&#8217;t see the humour in it. Bloody Australian larrikins! Drongos! Scallywags! Luckily Tristan challenged them after reading the meter before we returned it. Later that day spelt breaking point and we walked around Brussels in the rain. Tristan nearly lost it and went on a lengthy silent walk. Greg wanted to kill him with nearby objects, as he did.</p>
<p>We had 12 hours to fill. Brussels didn&#8217;t seem so great this time around. Later that night, after rotating through a whole range of emotional states and walking around for 10 hours with two hours? sleep, we caught the cheapest overnight bus to Berlin with all the other crooks and drug dealers. In Berlin we played a highlight show at an underground punk bar which seemed like the German CBGB&#8217;s. It was a large energetic crowd and we played with <a href="http://staticshockrecords.bandcamp.com/album/clever-clever">The Love Triangle</a> and the best band I&#8217;d seen in a long time, <a href="https://myspace.com/daslebenisteinpuff">P.U.F.F</a>, who were sorta like The Spits. Our friends were there, including Caroline from Day Ravies (unfortunately, she didn&#8217;t bring her clarinet to play with us) and the next day Greg, her and I went to Dubrovnik and we left Tristan at a Airbnb with some spiritual middle-aged woman whose apartment spelt like Middle Eastern cooking and Tibetan incense. We haven&#8217;t heard from him since. </p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
<strong>Greg:</strong> Confused by lack of sleep, but inspired by the last show, now wanting to continue. Becoming even more positive, friendly and sociable with the other supports. Face filled with a radiating glow post-performance. End is in sight, so reminisces during lulls of conversation.<br/>
<strong>Tristan:</strong> After the Brussels recovery and arrival into Berlin, he is pleased to discover cheap falafel. Obsessed with P.U.F.F like we all were, leaving Europe at just the right time before the money ran out, shocked that the punks didn&#8217;t hate our band. Now becoming sentimental and reflective.<br/>
<strong>Nathan:</strong> Feeling positive about the turnout and the other bands, the surroundings and endless flow of beer was also appreciated. Perhaps makes another poor business tactic later that night by handing out unsold records to strangers on the U-Bahn because he doesn&#8217;t want to take them to Croatia. Motivated by the Berlin show but avoids dwelling too much on the past.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Final Assessment  </h2>
<p>Overall, the erratic decision to do a small string of show in Europe was a damn good experience, an alternative way to see the countries and meet memorable people. To go with a purpose without feeling like a businessmen, but rather silly drunks with strings and sticks. All members kept it together, functioned well or as well as they could on stage and off. A healthy journey for the mind, and a crippling one for the nutrition levels of the body. It all balances out at the end of the day, like the tills at a family-run grocery store. Even if from time to time our souls got shoplifted.</p>
<p>Notable mentions to Tristan&#8217;s James Bond driving skills with an endurance stronger than a truck driver with a head full of pills. Mentally, Tristan wins awards for man least likely to alter his emotions or have a mental breakdown. He probably could have gone on forever. I became progressively quieter as the days went on due to exhaustion via constant interaction; Greg was fuelled by Tristan&#8217;s energy and could keep up with it. All and all, an interesting experience and, like everything, seems better in retrospect.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong><br/>
Touring is a good way to meet foreign strangers, see unique landscapes and drink to excess without feeling guilty.</p>
