                <h3>Gotye (aka Melbourne musician Wally De Backer) tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> how the artistic indecision at the heart of third album &#8216;Making Mirrors&#8217; almost cost him a number one.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022837/440x355-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Wally De Backer cuts a pretty unassuming figure for a guy who&#8217;s just topped the charts. He&#8217;s lanky and endearingly awkward (he describes himself as a ?delicate forward? in basketball terms); talks at a rate of knots; and is prone to nerding out, especially when discussing the technical intricacies of <em>Making Mirrors</em>, his third album under the Gotye moniker.</p>
<p>A lyrically rich and musically broad experience, <em>Making Mirrors* is another triumph for the Melbourne-based solo artist and sometime member of The Basics, who&#8217;s carved out a nice little niche for himself marrying pop smarts with experimental production and sound collage. Recorded mostly in a barn on De Backer&#8217;s parents? Mornington Peninsula block &#8211; it was later mixed with composer/producer Francois Tetaz (*Wolf Creek</em>, Sally Seltmann) &#8211; the album incorporates sounds from a variety of sources including Graeme Leak&#8217;s Winton Musical Fence (it&#8217;s sampled on first single ?Eyes Wide Open?); a Lowrey Cotillion electronic organ, which his parents gave him as a Christmas present; and an 18th-century pump harmonium that he set up in the barn.</p>
<p>When I met De Backer out the back of a Melbourne cafe, he&#8217;s just returned from Splendour In The Grass &#8211; ?The best festival I&#8217;ve hung out at? &#8211; and has been buoyed by news the album&#8217;s latest single, ?Somebody That I Used To Know? (a duet with Melbourne-based singer Kimbra Johnson), has just hit number one on ARIA&#8217;s Singles Chart. When Kimbra joined De Backer on stage at Splendour, the crowd response was 10 decibels shy of a jumbo jet flying 10 metres overhead. </p>
<p>?The audience went ballistic,? De Backer recalls. ?It was physically assaulting &#8211; even though I had in-ear monitors. It was intense &#8211; It was hard to hear what I was singing at time &#8211; just the audience and the general murmur of excitement. That&#8217;s exciting, but it makes it hard to play sometimes.?</p>
<p><strong>How did you hook up with Kimbra in the first place?</strong><br/>
Francois Tetaz, who I mix with, suggested it. But I met Kimbra a few years ago, maybe when she moved to Melbourne a year before. She was still 17 or 18. We didn&#8217;t really stay in touch very closely but she&#8217;d been working with Franc on her record. I bumped into her around the studio and we reconnected and said g&#8217;day. I&#8217;d been thinking about other vocalists and I tried it with other vocalists, and Franc just said: ?You should get Kimbra.?</p>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s proven to be a really good move.</strong><br/>
Apart from the fortuitous aspect of her career path &#8211; it feels like a great alignment &#8211; the reason I wasn&#8217;t happy with that song up until I found Kimbra was because I wasn&#8217;t getting that core, ?This feels really great and right and raw.? She brought that to it. That was the thing that really made the song.</p>
<p><strong>Is that female counterpoint something you wanted from the outset?</strong><br/>
I didn&#8217;t know about that from the outset. I went about writing the song quite linearly. When I got to the end of the first chorus, I felt for the first time, in any song I&#8217;d written, that I&#8217;d said all I had to say. Any attempt to work an instrumental path, or bridge, back towards a repeat of the chorus felt very weak. At that point I went, ?I think it needs another story. It&#8217;s going to be a duet.? So I wrote the female part and looked for someone to bring it to life.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s not a specific break-up song is it?</strong><br/>
I haven&#8217;t had that many relationships in my life &#8211; maybe three or four &#8211; but there aspects of those that come up in certain longs in the song &#8211; It&#8217;s very much a memory song for me. It literally starts with, ?Now and then I think of when we were together.? Sometimes you go into this nostalgia or sentimentality, or elements of angst or bitterness bubble up when you least expect it. I wanted to try and capture that range of things.</p>
<p><strong>I guess when you make a record over three or four years, a lot of different stories from different places come up.</strong><br/>
Some songs end up being very key to a certain time or experience, and other just amass in a way subconsciously and then come out in a lyric.</p>
<p><strong>Has the success of ?Somebody?? and ?Eyes Wide Open? taken the pressure off a bit?</strong><br/>
I felt like ?Eyes Wide Open? wasn&#8217;t that well-received, especially because it was a really hard track to finish. To tell you the complete truth, with both tracks, I still didn&#8217;t feel satisfied when I finished them. I just kinda let them go. It wasn&#8217;t about being a perfectionist. I felt like I made them the best they could be, and there wasn&#8217;t anything pragmatic or realistic I could do anymore in terms of remixing, tweaking, re-recording vocals, trying another part, or spending more money and time. I&#8217;d only make them sound worse or start disappearing in my own head &#8211; or rectum. [<em>Laughs</em>] In a way my feelings with both songs were a bit deflated afterwards &#8211; With distance and as I&#8217;m playing them live, maybe I&#8217;ll get to like them more.</p>
<p><strong>Did those songs delay the record?</strong><br/>
?Somebody That I Used To Know? did. It was good in a way, because it&#8217;s a song that&#8217;s set the record up and connected with people. In the interim, while it was holding the record up, I wrote ?I Feel Better?, which is another one that has a great energy. It&#8217;s a key song for me on the album.</p>
<p><strong>For me, that&#8217;s the emotional turning point of the record.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s the arc I&#8217;m hearing, which I only realised was there after I sequenced it.</p>
<p><strong>I often wonder with your records at what point you decide you&#8217;re finished.</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m very intrigued to see what people make of the song ?In Your Light?. I was very close to not putting it on the album. I worked a long time on that track, rewrote the lyric a lot, mixed it a number of times &#8211; It&#8217;s vaguely Christian pop. In a way it&#8217;s on the record  because enough people &#8211; from my friends to my family and management &#8211; all went, ?You can&#8217;t lose that song. It&#8217;s great. You&#8217;ve just lost perspective.? I was very close to going, ?This is too cheesy. I can&#8217;t accept it, I don&#8217;t like it, I want it off the record.? It was the one track which I put on the record because other people thought I should. I feel like it might be quite a divisive track for people.</p>
<p><strong>That riff almost sounds like a sample. It&#8217;s so immediate.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s got a lot of immediate things on it. I worked on it so hard, and the closer I got to it being mixed, the more I started to hate it and think it was a really bad piece of music that I&#8217;d be stupid for releasing. That people would just think is shit, or that it sounds like I&#8217;m not challenging myself enough. But as a point on the record, I guess it&#8217;s the more obvious, ?Here&#8217;s a surface, here&#8217;s a moment that I ever only infrequently experience in my life.? The whole song&#8217;s about that, I guess: these tiny moments of not feeling encumbered by doubt and uncertainty and being happy for maybe a slightly longer period. Moments of pure happiness.</p>
<p><strong>It makes sense that it follows a song called ?I Feel Better?.</strong><br/>
There are a few songs on the record that are grouped in doubles. ?State of the Art? and ?Don&#8217;t Worry We&#8217;ll Be Watching You? are variations on a vaguely dub direction.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that you were worried about ?In Your Light?, because ?State of the Art? for me is the real out-of-the-box moment.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m proudest of and I like the best.</p>
<p><strong>I think you can make an entire record off of that blueprint.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d like to. That&#8217;s me just wanting to make a Ween record. [<em>Laughs</em>] I love Ween so much &#8211; It&#8217;s a daggy track in so many ways. It&#8217;s written about a Lowrey Cotillion organ that my parents gave me for a Christmas present. They bought it for $100 from a Salvation Army store. Most of the sounds on the track &#8211; all the widdly things, all the fills, the things that I&#8217;m singing about &#8211; are from the organ. It became a vehicle for me to explore my love of all these quaint synthesiser sounds on the organ, but also muse on how fascinated I am by the fact that pieces of technology like that can be state-of-the-art at a particular point in history &#8211; Technology like that, which was once quite cutting edge, can so quickly be in the bargain bin. It&#8217;s really musing on how you can get this personal relationship with technology that to other people is really quaint.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a tech geek?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I think I&#8217;m always drawn to being even more of one. I try to limit myself. Just recently my new laptop hard-drive carked it. I did a disc repair and it fucked it up &#8211; It&#8217;s laborious that stuff. I hate getting bogged down by it. I tried really hard with this record not to &#8211; even though I did some very laborious things, like multi-sampling my auto-harp note-by-note and turning it into a virtual auto-harp, which features on ?Save Me?. I stopped short of taking the easier option, just nerding out going, ?I&#8217;m just going to spend the whole week virtualising every instrument.? At the end of the week you might have a nice treasure trove of new things to play with, but I had to limit myself and go, ?Just virtualise one instrument you like and try to use it somewhere and make a musical statement with it.? You can just disappear down a rabbit hole so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s overwhelming.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s so much out there.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a broad record once again. I guess that&#8217;s reflective of your musical collection?</strong><br/>
Maybe. [<em>Laughs*] With my last record [*Like Drawing Blood</em>] I was actively pursuing broadening my musical horizons. Here, I didn&#8217;t have as much time to listen to music, so when I did have a chance to listen to music just for pleasure, I&#8217;m not as interested in going, ?I might check out those 40 minutes of Iranian [music] that I&#8217;m not familiar with?. It&#8217;d be more like, ?I might put on the new Bon Iver record because I really like it and I&#8217;ve only heard it four times and I want to hear it again.? The stuff I listen to is all over the shop.</p>
<p><strong>Has listening to music become more of a recreational thing for you?</strong><br/>
I still really love listening to music for pleasure. I wish I had more time to listen to music. In my early 20s I&#8217;d spend a lot of time with friends listening to records. I love that experience, but I don&#8217;t get that much of a chance to do it anymore. My girlfriend and I will listen to music in the car &#8211; that&#8217;s nice to share records there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you come up with songs in the car?</strong><br/>
More Basics songs than Gotye songs, although ?I Feel Better? was started in the car. I was listening to Martha Reeves? ?Dancing In The Street? and marvelling at the tambourine backbeat. The tambourine is ludicrously loud. I almost think of it as the hand of God just smashing this massive calf-skin tambourine. It towers over the whole mix. Fuck it&#8217;s amazing how some of these Motown tracks can be defined by a such a small percussive instrument that can be made to sound so huge. I just stopped the track and kept hearing that backbeat feel &#8211; I rapidly ran inside when I got home, found a tambourine sample, put reverb on it, made it sound really big, sat down at the piano and turned that into a song in an hour. That was a direct response to a Motown soul song.</p>
<p><strong>Are records usually triggers for you?</strong><br/>
They can be. The fairly warped vocals on ?State of the Art? are inspired by a Godley &amp; Creme song called ?I Pity Inanimate Objects?, which is off their album <em>Freeze Frame</em>. It has this wild vocal effect concept, which is one of the only vocal effects I&#8217;ve never been able to work out. I looked it up online and I still don&#8217;t quite understand how they did it. It sounds intensely laborious. It was a different process I used, but I guess it inspired me.</p>
<p><strong>Is it Auto-Tune?</strong><br/>
Auto-Tune is part of it, but it doesn&#8217;t really sound like the way most people use Auto-Tune. I just tried to imagine how Godley &amp; Creme might&#8217;ve done their vocal concept. I thought if I just tried the techniques I thought they were using, what would the end result sound like? Well, it ends up sounding like this track. [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p>[<em>De Backer nerds out while describing how he came up with the vocal technique</em>]</p>
<p><strong>That process sounds very mathematical.</strong><br/>
Yeah, but it worked quite well. There was a lot of finicky stuff afterwards.</p>
<p>[<em>More nerding out</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d love to see you make an animated clip for it.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve made an animated clip for ?State of the Art?, which has turned out really good. Some guys from Melbourne called Rubber House did it. They have a really great ?50s animation aesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>Was that the thinking behind the companion, making-of DVD. Did you want people to see the process behind the record?</strong><br/>
I was a little worried while making these docos with my friends James Bryans that it was stripping away some of the mystery of what I do. I&#8217;m generally not someone who wants to hoard their production secrets, because I think the ideas will hopefully speak for themselves rather than the technical secrets about how it&#8217;s made. I actually had fun making these docos with James; I sometimes enjoyed it more than making parts of the record because it was totally new for me?</p>
<p><strong>Did working across another medium have a positive impact on the musical side of your brain.</strong><br/>
I think maybe when I was younger I had a greater variety of things that would do that &#8211; even playing basketball. I wonder if that varies now because I don&#8217;t exercise as much anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What position did you play?</strong><br/>
Forward, sometimes centre.</p>
<p><strong>Power forward?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Delicate forward.</p>
<p><strong>You did most of the recording for the album in a barn?</strong><br/>
Most of it, yeah. Anybody who played instruments &#8211; my friend Lucas played bass, or Gareth Skinner, who played all these amazing cello harmonics that make the whale-like sounds on ?Eyes Wide Open? &#8211; they were all done wherever was most convenient for them. I&#8217;d just go to Lucas? loungeroom, plug my mobile system in and hit play, or go to Franc&#8217;s studio because Lucas lived around the corner. A few people came down on the barn and recorded with me, but living an hour-and-a-half out of town [Melbourne] isn&#8217;t so convenient.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Where&#8217;s the barn?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s down on the [Mornington] Peninsula on my parents? block.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022841/400x300-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>And your dad [Frank De Backer] made all the soundproofed tubing?</strong><br/>
He did. He&#8217;s an amazing engineer. He&#8217;s amazing to have as a co-conspirator on my stuff, because I can kinda go, ?Do you reckon you could investigate making a screen which could do this, and fit in this and meet these requirements?? A month later he&#8217;ll present me with a full brief and a prototype from China. [<em>Laughs</em>] Dad&#8217;s engineering and system design skills like that are amazing like that. He can research and work something out &#8211; he makes things so well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think some of that has filtered down into the way you make music?</strong><br/>
I always think it&#8217;s child&#8217;s play, because dad has so many skills. [<em>Laughs</em>] He was never a soccer dad, but in Year 7 he&#8217;d give me a lot of help with my science projects. Over time it probably impressed on me to be a jack of all trades.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever want to follow him down that engineering path?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. When I was growing up Dad was working in systems engineering and design. He was working for big banks designing mainframe software. I didn&#8217;t really understand anything about the work he did, I only vaguely got a grasp of it more recently. Dad was more of a guy who&#8217;d be making things on weekends: making chairs or fixing things. For him it was probably a big release from sitting at a computer all day during the week. Now he&#8217;s building things all the time. He&#8217;s built this barn almost singlehandedly. He&#8217;s built their house on the top of the block. He loves me giving him projects.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3022838/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>And obviously during that time he dabbled in art too? [The album cover was painted by Frank De Backer in the 1980s.]</strong><br/>
Yeah, he&#8217;s actually gone back to painting recently too.</p>
<p><strong>Because of the album?</strong><br/>
No, he&#8217;s funny like that. I remember how Dad used to be a smoker, but he&#8217;d be able to quit at the drop of a hat. ?I&#8217;m not feeling very good &#8211; I&#8217;ll stop smoking.? For five years he wouldn&#8217;t smoke and then he&#8217;d start smoking again. [<em>Laughs</em>] He has a lot of self-control I guess like that. He&#8217;s started painting with some acrylics on chipboard recently &#8211; They&#8217;re Aboriginal dot painting type things, but it&#8217;s got his style to them. Again, it just came out of nowhere. ?Oh, you&#8217;re painting again, Dad?? He&#8217;s like, ?Yeah, I just felt like painting.? </p>
<p><strong>He has a readymade audience now too?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t think he does it for any other reason than to explore and satisfy himself. I think both Mum and Dad are loners on some level. They have a strong friendship relationship. They don&#8217;t really have a lot of friends they see regularly. They do their own projects, they live on the block and they grow vegetables. They&#8217;re not super social in that regard, and maybe I&#8217;m the same a bit. I like a lot of time to myself.</p>
<p><strong>That isolatory aspect is really prevalent in the records you&#8217;ve made.</strong><br/>
Well, that&#8217;s one of the core differences with The Basics. Being in a band, part of the process is being together and working together and often then working in certain timelines, where you can&#8217;t enjoy the luxury of working at your own pace or in your own headspace. Sometimes it&#8217;s a good spur, and sometimes I found it a barrier with The Basics. Sometimes I&#8217;d go, ?This is not quite feeling good yet, but we have to do it because I&#8217;m not available then, or we have to do a tour or finish mixing.? Whereas with me, half the reason my records take so long is because I go, ?Even though I&#8217;m frustrated and I would&#8217;ve liked to have released this record by now, it&#8217;s not really finished yet, so I&#8217;ll just keep working on it.?</p>
<p><strong>I guess some people would question your loyalty to the Basics given the way your career has progressed.</strong><br/>
People have mentioned that. I&#8217;ve heard people be very direct and say, ?You&#8217;re a fucking idiot. You&#8217;ve got all these opportunities people would kill for, you&#8217;ve got talent. The Basics are great, we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re your mates, but go with what&#8217;s giving you opportunities.? I definitely felt that at times &#8211; Oh look, I don&#8217;t know. I love the guys and thought we had good music to make and record. It was a bit of an uphill battle &#8211; The reception has not kept on par <a href="/discussions/1036635">with Gotye] in terms of [triple j support</a> and the audience size and opportunities. That&#8217;s got harder and harder to balance out. On some level I wish they could&#8217;ve kept pace more, but I guess it&#8217;s hard to get through those media bottlenecks?</p>
<p><strong>Has it made you appreciate the opportunities you&#8217;ve been given a bit more?</strong><br/>
I think so. It&#8217;s made me realise how much time you have to invest to do something really well; to back it up, take those opportunities and make the most of them. I wasn&#8217;t ready to make a new Gotye record if I thought The Basics stuff was taking off. I think I would&#8217;ve followed through with that if things were going well? </p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m putting my business hat on here, but it proves how important the sense of momentum is in the music industry. A lot of people might&#8217;ve said that I was stupid for losing that [momentum] by going off the scene for three or four years. I felt like that with putting out ?Eyes Wide Open?, the momentum wasn&#8217;t forthcoming. It&#8217;s been exciting to see the new single seemingly giving a pathway for the record to do that?</p>
<blockquote><p>?Sometimes you go into this nostalgia or sentimentality, or elements of angst or bitterness bubble up when you least expect it. I wanted to try and capture that range of things.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Well you&#8217;re talking to me at a time when you&#8217;ve sold out four shows at The Forum [in Melbourne] and had your first number one.</strong><br/>
That says to me that, at least with my project, it&#8217;s worth taking the time until I think I have something good together. But who knows? I could&#8217;ve finished the mix of some of these songs months earlier and people might&#8217;ve still liked it. That played on my head at different times. Franc, who I mixed it with, would always make jokes like, ?Is it going to affect the charts?? Because he&#8217;s not about commercial imperatives at all.  </p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t think you make records like that either.</strong><br/>
No, I don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;d be getting to the fourth or fifth mix and sometimes I wouldn&#8217;t be able to express why I thought we weren&#8217;t getting it to feel right. He&#8217;d be like, ?I don&#8217;t know Wally &#8211; is it going to affect the charts?? [<em>Laughs</em>] It was in a supportive way: ?Maybe it&#8217;s as good as it can be, and whatever you change is not going to make any difference to how people experience the music.?</p>
<p><strong>Where are you at with the record now? How do you feel about it?</strong><br/>
It felt like quite a relief to have it mastered. [<em>Laughs</em>] But the manufacturing side of it has been annoying too. The product that I care most about &#8211; the vinyl with the gatefold sleeve &#8211; is not going to be finished by the release date, because the artwork was late and the first test pressing had an error in it &#8211; With vinyl it&#8217;s hard because there&#8217;s a real artistry to how it&#8217;s cut. It&#8217;s not just burning a CD.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thinking behind the mini-orchestra tour?</strong><br/>
I thought the last time I did the mini-orchestra tour in 2007-2008 was really good, but I didn&#8217;t pay much mind to how integral backing vocals are to my music. So I got this 11-piece ensemble together with a string quartet and saxes, drums and percussion and discovered that none of those people could actually sing. So I really wanted a band that could play all of my music completely live: all vocals and instruments.</p>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s the Brian Wilson approach?</strong><br/>
Have as many people covering as many instruments and voices as possible, yeah. It&#8217;s been hard finding a great sax player who can also sing well. I had a really good moment yesterday in rehearsal where we played six or seven songs in a row and I was like, ?This sounds fucking great and it&#8217;s all live!? That feels a lot more exciting to me than being the guy who&#8217;s referencing a click track, trying to sing a lead vocal while holding down the drum part. </p>
