                <h3>New Zealand is preparing for an Aussie invasion, with a host of local bands set to make the journey across the Tasman for Camp A Low Hum. TIM SCOTT reports.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002486/378x283-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="378" height="283"/><br/>
Call it ?cultural flight? in reverse. From February 6-8, more than 20 Australian bands will cross the Tasman to descend on the third annual Camp A Lo Hum festival.</p>
<p>Surrounded by rolling hills 35 minutes outside Wellington, Camp A Lo Hum is not your typical music festival. With tickets limited to 800, it&#8217;s more like a large backyard party. There are no backstage areas, press pits or AAA passes and, in an unorthodox measure, the line-up (60+ acts) is not announced until the weekend of the festival.</p>
<p>?The philosophy behind Camp is that its importance lies in the vibe and atmosphere rather than who is performing,? says organiser/host Blink (aka Ian Jorgensen). ?The freedom of not having to announce a line-up means I can book only the best live bands, not those who have ?pull? or get by on popularity alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Camp A Low Hum&#8217;s tradition of not announcing the line-up until the last minute, the names of some of the Australian bands rumoured to be playing this year have been leaked. They include My Disco, The Crayon Fields, Justice Yeldham, Baseball, East Brunswick All Girls Choir, Aleks and the Ramps, Pikelet, Ned Collette, Actor/Model, The Stabs and Rand and Holland.</p>
<p>Having worked as label manager, zine publisher and tour promoter, Blink says the original motivation behind Camp A Lo Hum was to throw a party that felt like an old-school summer camp.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We have movies but instead of a massive screen and fancy sound system I get my old projector, a ?90s Sony stereo system and screen movies in the kitchen.?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to describe what makes Camp different. Try to imagine a totally budget school camp version of Golden Plains. We have movies but instead of a massive screen and fancy sound system I get my old projector, a ?90s Sony stereo system and screen movies in the kitchen. It is exactly like going to a school/scout camp, except instead of having to tie knots and practise sewing, you get to watch awesome bands all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evelyn Morris (Pikelet), who played the festival last year and is returning again, likens Camp A Lo Hum to a small indie-rock village.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the feeling of a little temporary community for the weekend. As opposed to that crazed partied-up messy feel you get from a lot of festivals. It&#8217;s an environment where you gather that people are looking out for one another.</p>
<p>?The atmosphere at Camp is one of elation, exploration and open expression. It&#8217;s really obvious that the younger residents of NZ, who are aware of Camp, are extremely into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcus Hobbs played the festival two years ago with Bang Bang Aids and is returning with his latest solo project East Brunswick All Girls Choir.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first year we turned up to the police requesting the sound to be turned down a bit while commenting on how good the band playing was. It&#8217;s relaxed, like a school camp where you&#8217;re allowed to drink and watch amazing bands for three days. I imagine it&#8217;s what Meredith was like when it first started, 800 people and time to party.?</p>
<p>Despite most bands having to pay their own way, Blink says they can expect to encounter a receptive and supportive audience upon arrival.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002487/378x869-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="378" height="869"/><br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s basically the best way to introduce yourself to a NZ audience. Almost all of the Australian acts playing are fully paying their own way over. Most will lose money on this trip, but its an invaluable investment. With one fell swoop you are playing to the bulk of people in NZ genuinely interested in new music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other activities include a mixtape swap and ?Boxwars?, an event that involves cardboard, lots of it. But it&#8217;s the Renegade Stage that perhaps best symbolises the spirit of the weekend. Created for the fans by the fans, it has evolved into a festival highlight; one that even corporate giants are keen to get involved in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It started at the first event because one band, Whipping Cats, found one of their sets got pinched by another band, The Coolies. So they stole the backline from one of my stages and late one night set up in their cabin and rocked a legendary party. Since then, I&#8217;ve just embraced this concept of realising that I&#8217;m often out of touch with what people want, so I just do my best to simply facilitate the party. I provide the gear, the rooms, the inspiration &#8230; The punters bring and create the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, MySpace wanted to sponsor part of Camp and do one of their ?secret shows?. I told them that if they bought tickets, they could come along, and just like anybody else, they could throw a party. So they bought tickets, came to camp, got some crayons, scribbled on some posters in the arts-and-crafts room and threw a killer party one night with Bang Bang Aids and Batrider.</p>
<p>?Seeing this corporate monster, getting down and partying like anyone else at camp and paying to do so was awesome.?</p>
<p>But whether you&#8217;re a Melbourne band making the trans-Tasman trek, a Kiwi indie kid or a corporate social networker, the emphasis at Camp A Lo Hum is always on fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you really need to know about this festival is there are no rules except for &#8216;no dicks&#8217;,&#8221; explains Hobbs. &#8220;People want to go have fun, not be critical, not be jerks. Sit on the grass, watch music, swim in the pool and never show any fear of a threatening sun peaking over the hills at 6am.?</p>
