                <h3>In July, Melbourne&#8217;s <strong>MATHEW WATSON</strong> (a.k.a. Other Places) was invited by noise-rock legends <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boredoms">Boredoms</a> to partake in a 91-drummer extravaganza at Japan&#8217;s biggest arena. That was just the beginning.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3036719/420x520-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
At the request of Boredoms I was flown to Japan to take part in one of the great musical experiences of my life.</p>
<p>It was another grand-scale Boredoms event, this time featuring 91 drummers. It was called BoaDrum 7&#215;13 and was held at <a href="http://www.m-messe.co.jp/en/">Makahari Messe</a>, Japan&#8217;s biggest arena. The event also featured Keiji Heino, Crass and Steve Hillage, among a host of others, and was a fundraiser for the victims of the tsunami and Fukushima disaster. Yamantaka Eye <a href="http://www.dommune.com/freedommunezero2013/news/boredoms-presentsxboa-drumfreedommune-0-zero-one-thousand-2013">of Boredoms, pictured at right with Watson] eloquently describes the event [here</a>.</p>
<p>As is the norm with Boredoms BoaDrum events, of which I have participated in 10.10 and 111, they select key drum leaders to help steer the massive collective of drummers and other musicians through a complex tangle of gestured composition and conducted improvisation.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036718/640x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Along with the core members of Boredoms &#8211; Eye, Yoshimi [P-We], Yojiro [Tatekawa] and Shinji [Masuko] &#8211; there were five US collaborators: Hisham Bharoocha (Soft Circle, ex-Black Dice), Brian Chippendale (Lightening Bolt), Butchy Fuego (San Gabriel, Pit Er Pat, Sun Araw), Ryan Sawyer (Lone Wolf, ex-At the Drive-In), Christopher Powell (Man Man) and myself. The other drum leaders were made up of a who&#8217;s who of the Japanese underground, musicians, actors and fans alike.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036731/427x476-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We rehearsed and sound-checked, loaded into a grand hall that made semitrailers unloading backline look like matchbox cars. The scene was set; the lights dropped to a warm orange glow. Our drums were wrapped in blankets, sleeping, awaiting Eye&#8217;s signal to slowly bring 91 full drum kits to life. The crowd arrived and slowly filled the enormous hall, flanking the reverse spiral of drum kits from all sides; the energy growing, the room temperature rising.</p>
<p>We made our way to our assigned positions, all 91 of us. Our audience went quiet and we sat in silence as Eye prepared himself, focussing on the mammoth task of leading such a large ensemble. One by one each drummer lifted the blanket, awaking their sleeping drums, and the cymbals ever so gently began to sizzle. The crowd could not contain themselves and, as Eye conducted our dynamic cymbal swell, they collectively followed with intermittent screams of excitement.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036720/640x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The hall was alive with anticipation: 91 drummers working together, creaking at the joints under the strain as each drum leader attempted to keep their group locked tight. The composition grew from that initial cymbal swell into a sweaty beast. Motorik-like rhythms, drone-y guitars, exotic soundscapes and a cacophony of free playing and psychedelic syncopated drum rounds, all held together by the energy, chants and undulating electronic textures being created by the Boredoms core of Eye, Yoshimi, Yojiro and Shinji.</p>
<p>The show lasted nearly two whole hours. It felt like 10 minutes. I had experienced an alternate reality. A shifting of mind and body. The show ended and thousands of onlookers roared in collective excitement. The feeling was intense and unlike anything I&#8217;d felt before. It wasn&#8217;t ego-driven. No one heard or cared what you did. The only care was for the group, and this group of 91 drummers were a good group of humans for creating such a focussed, unified and heavy sound. Something really special happened that night.</p>
<p>After the show we celebrated with a slice of bread made with hemp ash, designed by a wonderful baker from Kamakura. And we drank. A lot.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036721/640x450-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>Celebratory bread</strong></p>
<p>My experience was one of physical pain, emotional exhilaration, dehydration, mental anguish and euphoric clarity. We were pushed to the limits of our physical endurance and abilities. I had arrived in Japan excited about what experiences would lie ahead and, only a few days in, I had played one of the most excitingly intense and challenging shows of my life.</p>
<p>What was to unfold in the following weeks now seems like a dream. I was taken sailing on a 35-foot yacht accompanied by an exotic dancer named Hayati; partied like it was 1999; learnt that my mind is not in my head but my chest; stayed in a traditional Japanese home built in 1942; spent excessive amounts of money on clothing and guitar pedals; ate the best ramen, cold soba and okonomiyaki I&#8217;ve ever had; went on a beautiful date with a famous musician named Yoko; had my hair cut by a celebrity hairdresser who insisted on bringing me to the party as much as he could; bathed naked with a hundred Japanese men in a themepark-styled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen">onsen</a>; ate dinner with Eye, Yoshimi and Shinji on top of a mountain overlooking Nara and watched the moon rise red; swam beneath a 30-foot waterfall in a stream whose water seems to have permanently changed the chemistry of my skin, experienced surreal visions in the mountains which felt like I was drifting through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">Miyazaki</a>?s imagination; walked the <em>Blade Runner</em>-esque back alleys of Shinjuku to find a bar called Death Match in Hell, where I debated a businessman&#8217;s statement that ?Boy George was better than Megadeth.?</p>

<p><strong>Cycling the streets of Osaka</strong></p>
<p>I slept in a capsule hotel and ended up at a private party hosted by a notorious Japanese rude boy who had a mouth full of gold teeth and a heavy reputation based on his time in prison. I was told many times by my friend: ?Is ok, you in safe zone, you play with Boredoms.? I politely drank the gifted beer, bowed then exited. I fell in love every day with more beautiful women than I ever thought possible. There is more, a lot more. Those three weeks were a little out of control, the way any good tour is.</p>
<p>Ryan [Sawyer] reminds me of our first night in Tokyo, after a huge day of walking endlessly, eating a massive amount of sashimi, drinking many beers and a late-night party with our new Japanese friends. We jumped in a cab en route to our hotel, totally exhausted and happily smashed.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036729/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Ryan states: ?I remember you saying in the cab, ?There is a robot burlesque dinner theatre. We should go. It is close to here.?? Three weeks later I went. My mind was altered that night. I have no words to describe what I saw, felt and experienced. Please refer to the photo and do your own research.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.robot-restaurant.com/E/">Robot Restaurant</a> is in Shijuku. It&#8217;s not exactly burlesque or a dinner theatre. I still don&#8217;t know what it is but if you are in Tokyo, best book yourself a ticket.  </p>
