                <h3>In the latest installment of her tour diary, a ?completely exhausted? <strong>PIKELET</strong> hooks up with Bill Callahan, waves a teary goodbye to the Bachelorette crew and makes surprising visit to a strip club &#8211; and a Christian centre.
</h3>

My last report ended with our first show with Bonnie Prince Billy in Little Rock. From Little Rock we went on to play with Bonnie Prince Billy in Memphis, Nashville, Newport, Columbus and finally Lexington.  At the risk of sounding really predictable, I would say that every show was totally amazing. I loved seeing them play. They all appeared to have a lot of fun on stage, there was incredible chemistry between band members, they were playfully improvisational and yet still kept true enough to song structures so as to not edge into self-indulgence. Each show had an air of being a part of something memorable, which is what you want from a show I suppose. </p>
<p>Sun Studios in Memphis was a tacky tourist highlight for me. However, I was disappointed that Johnny Cash was only mentioned very briefly and featured only in one small photograph in the studio. It was pretty nice to connect such mythical musical figures with an actual solid place though. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005491/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In Newport we ate the best Mexican food of the whole tour. That night we stayed in Cincinnati and ate at an amazing downtown diner in the morning. I wanted to take photos there but was warned that there are several regulars that would rather not be photographed and would happily let you know in not so many words.</p>
<p>We played some great venues throughout this leg of the tour and the one in Columbus was pretty fancy. I somehow found myself wandering the streets in a confused daze in the wee hours of the morning in Columbus. It&#8217;s all a bit of a blur and involved something called a vaporizer, I know that much.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005498/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Lexington was Bonnie Prince Billy&#8217;s final show of their somewhat lengthy tour, so they went all-out and hired an amazing venue, a masseuse for all the band members and an incredible spread of food.  The promoter really did a great job. The venue was a beautiful, old stable house and BPB played an extra long and extra intimate show. I was so stoked to have been there. I would have told them all that much more eloquently, however, I managed to get myself completely written-off yet again. They played for three hours, which is a long time to consume drinks. I wasn&#8217;t the only one.</p>
<p>On June 14, we played in Pittsburgh in a tiny art gallery called Garfield Artworks. We&#8217;re back playing in the little DIY spaces, which is somewhat of a relief, although it&#8217;s a bit tricky with the Bachelorette set-up. We played with a young crazy band called Ball Of Fire Shoots Flames who were extremely entertaining. They played something of a combination of Broadway-style showtunes and prog rock.  Also playing was Nathan Xander and his band, who described themselves as being Tom Petty influenced. I&#8217;ve never had a reason to write about Tom Petty before, and now I&#8217;ve written about him twice during the last three diary entries.</p>
<p>Then on to New York, where we played at The Cake Shop in Manhattan and Union Hall in Brooklyn the following night. We played with Lichens at the Cake Shop. He&#8217;s been a favourite of mine for a few years now, making really mesmerizing droning meditative music. I have spent so many long trips in planes, trains and automobiles staring out the window and drifting off to sleep to his music. It was so incredible to get to see him play live.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005505/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In New York I also had the pleasure of spending a day-and-a-half walking around being a tourist. I stayed in a lovely big house with my good buddy Gary of Ladybug Transistor and Still Flyin? fame. We went for a walk through Prospect Park in Brooklyn and I found Carl Sagan&#8217;s name on the ground.</p>
<p>Philadelphia was pretty fun, but not entirely because of the show.  Mostly because we spent the later part of the evening at a strip joint after leaving the venue. It was a strange experience given it was my first time in a place like that. Craig the drummer was hassled by one of the strippers, who was trying to convince him to have a lap-dance. He really wasn&#8217;t interested and felt very awkward about the whole thing. He wound up giving her five dollars for a keyring from the Philadelphia baseball team rather than having to go through with a lap-dance or continue the awkward leave-me-alone conversation.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005504/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In the morning, Annabel and I made a visit to the Mutter Museum before hitting the road. It&#8217;s a museum of medical history, home to all kinds of grotesque and disgusting curiosities of the human body. I wholeheartedly enjoyed looking in all the jars of floating body parts, deformed baby corpses and all the wax models of messed-up skin conditions. There was even a piece of human leather and a book that was bound with it. There were hundreds of skulls. There were all kinds of strange crude tools that were used in surgery way back in the day.  I felt it was a somewhat similar experience to going to the strip club actually. Both experiences conjured revulsion as well as musings and wonderings.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I wholeheartedly enjoyed looking in all the jars of floating body parts, deformed baby corpses and all the wax models of messed-up skin conditions.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Then it was on to Baltimore, where we played at a place called The Talking Head. There were some heated discussions between band members over dinner this evening in which I was heavily involved, which dampened the beginning of my night somewhat. This is all part of the rollercoaster of the touring experience though. Once it was all settled I felt better than ever, and the show was one of my favourites of the tour so far. We played with some bands that were pretty fun, but my pick of the night was a duo called Reading Rainbow. They are a young couple, and sang very heart-felt songs that reminded me of a much more punky Mates of State. The audience on this night was so incredible to play with. There was lots of dancing and enthusiasm. It was a real highlight of the tour. Afterwards we hung out with the Beach House band members and stayed at Alex (of Beach House&#8217;s) house.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005507/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Pontiac was an interesting show, there was absolutely nobody there and there was a huge battle of the bands going on in the room next door. The rumble of nu-metal was audible throughout the whole Pikelet set.  Not that I&#8217;m complaining, I think it added something special perhaps.  Then on top of that, there was a HUGE storm raging outside during the entire show. I have never seen rain or lightning like that before. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005508/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Pontiac is right near Detroit, so we drove there after the show and stayed with our delightful host Greg, who had a remarkable knowledge and collection of NZ music. In the morning we had a great breakfast down at a diner near the markets. </p>
<p>Chicago became the new favourite show of the tour after Baltimore very quickly. The Hideout was awesome, there were heaps of people and both Pikelet and Bachelorette were received well. We stayed with Rob from Lichens who took us out to a sweet all-night diner with Dan from Drag City after the show. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005510/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Ok? Now it&#8217;s time for some generic road shots.  Considering the majority of the time we spent in America was spent in the back of a van, I feel it&#8217;s only fair to us to represent that time in picture form. What a hell-ride. If I never see the inside of a van again I&#8217;ll be pretty stoked.  (Given that I&#8217;m typing this whilst in a van in Europe? I can tell you that it&#8217;s not a possibility.)</p>
<p>We then played at 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis.  This was a strange show where there seemed to be a seven-second delay in between the end of songs and the commencement of audience appreciation. Considering there were not many people, it was especially painful. However, the night was redeemed by some lovely folks I met who seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005506/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The following two nights we played the final shows before joining the Bill Callahan tour. I got quite teary about not playing any more Pikelet shows with Bachelorette. Feeling the end of the tour creeping up made all the sentimental sediment rise up to the surface like all the fizzy bottles of Kombucha spilled all over the back of the van.</p>
<p>We joined up with Bill Callahan&#8217;s touring party in Salt Lake City. I was even more excited about these shows than I was about Bonnie Prince Billy, having been a little bit of an obsessive Smog fan for the last few years. I caught the bug late in the piece really, but was glad that it had made its way past my musical immune system in time to get to see him play the amazing new album seven times in a row. I had no luck getting any good photos of him or the band though, probably because I was busy being mesmerized by the wonderful arrangements, bizarre and beautiful strings and the tasteful interesting guitar parts. What a show.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005512/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The best show was in Seattle, at a big fancy venue called The Triple Door. It&#8217;s quite a shmick venue with a sit-down audience and amazing sound. Unfortunately we had a nightmare of a set where equipment went bad one too many times. Both of Annabel&#8217;s laptops stopped, Craig&#8217;s monitor mixer lost power, basically if it could stop working, it did.  So I ended up playing a Pikelet song while Craig and Annabel figured it all out (and cursed dramatically a little bit). Craig ended up deliriously waltzing to the Pikelet song on stage. It was quite a funny moment.</p>
<p>The Bill Callahan leg of the tour was also notable for featuring the strangest show so far. We played at a modern Christian centre in a place called Kennewick; a place I think most people don&#8217;t play too often. All up, we played seven shows with Bill Callahan in the mid-west and down the west coast. In Los Angeles &#8211; where it all began &#8211; I said a tearful goodbye to the Bachelorette crew.</p>
