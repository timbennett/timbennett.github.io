                <h3>Currently touring nationally, Shane Parsons and Simon Ridley from DZ Deathrays discuss strobe lights, house parties and ?NME? hype with <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3028753/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>DZ Deathrays and Bleeding Knees Club may share little in common aesthetically &#8211; the former plays a punishing brand of party-rock not unlike early Wolf &amp; Cub or DFA 1979, while the latter dabbles in bratty surf-garage &#8211; but their career paths have taken an uncannily similar trajectory.</p>
<p>Both duos cut their teeth playing house parties in their native Queensland. They signed to the same label, Melbourne&#8217;s I Oh You. They jointly appeared on <em>NME*?s ?50 Best New Bands of 2011?. And they&#8217;ve released their respective debuts within a month of each other. (DZ Deathray&#8217;s *Bloodstreams* came out earlier this month while *Nothing To Do</em> by Bleeding Knees was released in early March.)</p>
<p>When <em>M+N</em> caught up with DZ&#8217;s Simon Ridley and Shane Parsons at the South Melbourne offices of their label in February, they were about to head back overseas for showcase dates in Europe and the States. Down the hall in a separate boardroom, Bleeding Knees Club were gearing up to do the same thing. So do they get lumped in together overseas?</p>
<p>?A little bit,? says singer-guitarist Parsons, laughing. ?It must be the two-piece thing.? </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008664/440x662-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Ridley, the band&#8217;s guitarist-turned-drummer, has another theory. People who aren&#8217;t from Queensland, he jokes, have a problem distinguishing between their adopted hometown of Brisbane and Bleeding Knees Club&#8217;s native Gold Cast. The pair, however, originally hail from Bundaberg, only forming the band when they were sharing a house together in Brisbane. They started playing house parties under the name Denzel, but it was soon shortened to DZ, initially as a private joke. ?We called it DZ because it sounded more like a hip-hop troupe,? Ridley jokes.</p>
<p>DZ released only one EP, 2009 debut <em>Ruined My Life*, before a clash with a US dub-step producer forced yet another <a href="/news/4183264">name change</a>. Adding ?Deathrays? to their moniker in 2011, the band released a second EP, *Brutal Tapes</em>, all the while becoming renowned for their seizure-inducing live shows.</p>
<p><strong>Is the strobe lighting still a big part of what you do?</strong><br/>
Simon: When we can, yeah. We don&#8217;t really do it so much for supports or anything &#8211; that&#8217;d be weird &#8211; It&#8217;s just douche-y if you&#8217;re the support and you&#8217;ve got an entire lighting rig. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>So the strobes are more than just a DIY box on the ground?</strong><br/>
Simon: Well, now I use a laptop and a foot controller. That&#8217;s another thing that takes fucking ages, because we set it all up and run it all ourselves.</p>
<p>Shane: It&#8217;s a whole bunch of scenes that Simon changes by hitting the pedal. We write a set with the lights in mind. We only do it for headline sets because it takes 20-30 minutes just to set it up. You can&#8217;t do that for supports.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9zhtboOHoE0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Touring with that must be hard.</strong><br/>
Shane: It&#8217;s OK for the UK because you drive everywhere, but in Australia we fly, so you can&#8217;t really take lighting. At Laneway in Brisbane they had a lighting guy who kinda knew the gist of the band. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I think you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find someone in Brisbane who didn&#8217;t know the gist of the band.</strong><br/>
Shane: It&#8217;s weird because last year we did a show and the turnout was less than expected &#8211; We haven&#8217;t actually played that much in Brisbane. We spent three months of last year overseas. We haven&#8217;t been doing hometown shows, so it&#8217;s been really good recently: we did [shows with] Crystal Castles and Fucked Up, and Laneway.</p>
<p><strong>And Foo Fighters, of course [in 2011]. I guess you&#8217;re sick of talking about it though.</strong><br/>
Simon: No way, that was amazing. I could talk about it all day.</p>
<p><strong>Was it one of those scenarios where the big international rock band was too busy Skype-ing their kids to engage with the local supports?</strong><br/>
Simon: Well, the only guys we ended up really talking to were Fucked Up and some of the Tenacious D guys. We got to meet the Foo Fighters once. They had bodyguards that you had to get clearance from. It got really weird at one stage. They have this meeting room for VIPs, and we were in there trying to steal some of their booze because we ran out of ours. When Dave [Grohl] came in, there were literally all these people grabbing at him. We thought, ?This is fucking weird! We have to get out of here!? &#8211; The best bit was the food catering. We&#8217;d get in really early so we could get free lunches.</p>
<p><strong>You mean you don&#8217;t get food riders in Brisbane?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughter</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that new single ?No Sleep? premiered on BBC Radio 1 in the UK, rather than here. Was that a product of spending so much time over there [last year]?</strong><br/>
Shane: When we were over there the second time we did a live session [for BBC] at Maida Vale Studios, so it was pretty incredible that they asked us to do that.</p>
<p>Simon: Really bizarre. Being in there and knowing Metallica and Radiohead recorded there. [<em>Laughter</em>]</p>
<p>Shane: It was the end of the tour as well, so we were haggard. We&#8217;d done 22 shows in a row, and we&#8217;re not used to doing that because we&#8217;re an Australian band. People like [BBC presenter] Huw Stephens have been really supportive.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Did the <a href="/news/4275892">NME write-up</a> have any impact on the momentum in the UK?</strong><br/>
Simon: Yeah, definitely. As much as everyone hates it, if you get mentioned in there, people still abide by it for some reason.</p>
<p>Shane: It&#8217;s got such a huge following. Now, they&#8217;re so vibrant online. They just need to put a link up &#8211; and it goes crazy. The <em>NME* thing was really nuts. We never sent any music to them &#8211; They came to a show in Brighton and did a review of it. We did a two-hour interview with a guy [from *NME</em>] in Liverpool. We just sat down and had some beers at the end of our first UK tour. Since then they&#8217;ve kept in contact.</p>
<p><strong>Is ?No Sleep? indicative of how the record sounds?</strong><br/>
Shane: I think the reason we chose that [as a single] is because it&#8217;s a bridging step from the upbeat rock of the EP and the moments on the record that are a little different. There are some slower songs and stuff that&#8217;s more atmospheric in some ways.</p>
<p>Simon: We do write stuff that&#8217;s different to what we play live. We just don&#8217;t play it live because it&#8217;s boring.</p>
<p>Shane: And sometimes it&#8217;s too hard. I have a pedal that&#8217;s a sequencer so it&#8217;s all perfectly timed. Doing it live is difficult. Using laptops and click tracks &#8211; we just don&#8217;t do that. We&#8217;ll probably end up trying to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Where&#8217;d you record the album?</strong><br/>
Simon: We recorded it at Mount Nebo [in Queensland] where we did some of the other songs on the last EP. We got Richard [Pike] from PVT to come up and produce it.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like working with Richard?</strong><br/>
Simon: It was good. He pushed us. We&#8217;re pretty lazy when it comes to recording. Three takes max. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Shane: Richard really pushed me vocally. I would never class myself as a good singer, so it was good to have him pushing me to hit notes properly. It was relentless. I&#8217;d spend three hours singing one verse just to get it right. It was a good learning curve. We were able to add some synths to some songs, to give it a bit more of a dynamic and add colour to what&#8217;s essentially just guitars and drums.</p>
<p><strong>Did he play on the record?</strong><br/>
Shane: He did a synth line on ?Play Dead Until You&#8217;re Dead?. It&#8217;s a really swell-y sort of song all the way up until the end until it blows up. He wrote this descending keyboard part, which sounds really awesome, because it&#8217;s so unexpected. For another slow song we wrote some synths on his laptop.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="80" src="http://rd.io/i/QUdpFTegXes" frameborder="0"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Were you really intent on separating what you do live from what you do in the studio?</strong><br/>
Simon: I think this is just the first time we&#8217;ve been able to go into a cool studio and do stuff that we&#8217;ve wanted to do. Also, we wanted someone that would take us outside our comfort zone; to push us in ways that we wouldn&#8217;t have normally.</p>
<p>Shane: Just subtle things like, ?You should stop everything there. Just to give air to the song.? You just bypass that song because you&#8217;re totally focused on getting through the song without stuffing up. That&#8217;s the good thing about having someone else there &#8211; We love PVT and their records, but it&#8217;s a lot different. Richard likes us and our music, but it was different for him as well.</p>
<p><strong>I guess there&#8217;s a fine line: you don&#8217;t want to get rid of the intensity.</strong><br/>
Simon: We didn&#8217;t really change the songs too much. A lot of the songs were finished, there were one or two that we wanted someone else to guide to the end.</p>
<p><strong>Have the songs been kicking around for a while?</strong><br/>
Shane: There&#8217;s two songs off the second EP: ?Gebbie Street?, which got us some airplay in the UK; and a live track called ?Cops/Capacity?, which we re-recorded. It came up a bit slower. It&#8217;s a bit more rocky than punk.</p>
<p>Simon: More like a Kyuss song now.</p>
<p>Shane: I&#8217;m really happy with the record. We did 14 days and 14 songs. It was pretty relentless the whole time.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>And how many on the record?</strong><br/>
Shane: We&#8217;re pushing for 14. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a lost art: the long tracklisting.</strong><br/>
Simon: We really tried to tracklist it for vinyl.</p>
<p>Shane: That&#8217;s what we did. I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ll do over in the UK. It&#8217;s a different sort of scene. Maybe people in Australia will accept it a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>You guys still do house parties, don&#8217;t you?</strong><br/>
Simon: We do. People email us and if we can fit it in, we do it. We just make sure they don&#8217;t list it anywhere and they&#8217;re not allowed to tell anyone &#8211; We haven&#8217;t really done any house parties for a while though. Last one we did was actually a buck&#8217;s party. [<em>Laughs</em>] It was pretty fun. They had their own lighting rig in the lounge room.</p>

<p><strong>In Brisbane?</strong><br/>
Shane: We showed up in a cab with all our equipment and the guy paid for the cab. We just played to a bunch of dudes and their dads. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer doing house shows?</strong><br/>
Simon: Yeah, because you never know what&#8217;s going to happen. If you play a big stage where you&#8217;re 10 metres away from the crowd, the only thing that could happen is that you fuck up. And that&#8217;s not very fun.</p>
<p>Shane: I went to a show in Melbourne in a car park in the rain. I was there, and some of my friends bands played, and I really wanted to play. I hadn&#8217;t been to a show that I really wanted to play for ages. It was such a good vibe. Everyone was huddled under tarps. I guess in Brisbane there&#8217;s not many shows like that to play. People were trying to do warehouse shows for a while and they all just got shut down.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/4165093">Brisbane venue] [Lofly</a> was one of the last ones, I guess.</strong><br/>
Shane: That was amazing, we played one of our best shows there. It was so hot &#8211; there was water dripping off the ceiling. There&#8217;s no time schedule really, and people don&#8217;t have to worry about getting kicked out by a bouncer. And sometimes they sound great, too.</p>
<p><strong>Is your future in Brisbane?</strong><br/>
Shane: We&#8217;re going back to Europe, it&#8217;s just whether we can afford to live [there].</p>
<p>Simon: We still love Brisbane. All our friends are there. It just sucks touring from Australia outwards. There&#8217;s like two days to England and it&#8217;s so expensive.</p>
<p>Shane: Every time you want to go overseas, factoring in flights, accommodation and car hire, it&#8217;s $10,000 &#8211; and that&#8217;s just for two people. </p>
<p>Simon: Unless you&#8217;re getting grants every single tour it&#8217;s just impossible.</p>
