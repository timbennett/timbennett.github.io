                <h3>Our report from day one of the eighth annual Golden Plains festival, with highlights including The Drones, Charles Bradley, Yo La Tengo and King Gizzard. Band reviews by <strong>DOUG WALLEN<em>* and **LACHLAN KANONIUK**. Photos by *</em>CAMERON STEWART</strong>.
</h3>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038704/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Lachlan Kanoniuk: Much like its not-quite identical twin sister, Golden Plains acts as a blank canvas for which to paint meaning. It&#8217;s reliable, more reliable than any long-standing festival still breathing. We focus on the variables, some out of our control (the chain of perfect weather thankfully continues), some within our grasp (optimal and economic tinny selection, arrival time and campsite selection). Golden Plains? evolution is a subtle one, tinkering with the tried and true formula to rekindle the magic anew each time. I don&#8217;t think anyone will be taking it for granted anytime soon. </p>
<p>Doug Wallen: During the first set of the weekend, one of the guys from SixFtHick declares ?Let&#8217;s get wasted!? During the very next set, Oscar Slorach-Thorn (a.k.a. Oscar Key Sung) makes a somewhat meeker suggestion: ?Let&#8217;s dance and be friends.?</p>
<p>But, of course, those two wishes aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive, and they provide readily achievable goals for the weekend. This year&#8217;s lineup may be on the soft side, with a lot of repeat acts from recent years in the Supernatural Amphitheatre (Chet Faker, Charles Bradley, Cosmic Psychos, Hiatus Kaiyote, King Gizzrd, etc.) as well as several faces fresh off Big Day Out or Laneway (The Drones, Adalita, Cosmic Psychos again), but it&#8217;s hard to complain when you&#8217;ve got blazing heavyweight sets by The Drones, Public Enemy and You Am I &#8211; not to mention pleasant surprises in the form of Japanese soul and Spanish surf rock.</p>
<p>Besides their aforementioned proclamation, <strong>SixFtHick</strong>?s set itself is all the more encouragement to cut loose. Unhinged in a way that&#8217;s admirable for 2 o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, the Brisbane veterans continue to get endless mileage out of the Corbett brothers? tag-team leadership. Lean, dirty and shirtless, Ben Corbett especially felt like a wild card. As for the music? It was a classic Australian pub pummeling &#8211; only without the pub and in broad daylight.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038705/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>LK: The Supernatural Amphitheatre&#8217;s temperamental acoustics &#8211; long the bane of any visiting chamber pop exponents &#8211; has yet to ascend to a consistent quality. It&#8217;s evident when SixFtHick&#8217;s sludgy rock barely elevates above AM-radio quality to anyone not located to the immediate fore of stage. Sound issues aside, co-frontman brothers Ben and Geoff Corbett contorted swagger doesn&#8217;t sit right in the open air, sun-drenched setting, feeling a long way from their natural late-night, rafter-swinging, pub environment. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m no sound engineer, but maybe some supplementary PA stacks to the rear of the festival grounds would alleviate any problematic sound dispersion.</p>
<p>The schedule jack-knifes stylistically from down ?n? dirty hard rock into chilled-out, beat driven electronica with <strong>Andras Fox and Oscar Key Sung</strong>. The Pharrell-mimicking giant hats set the mood for a levity-imbued performance, goofy banter (Oscar Key Sung becoming Ocker Key Sung with a caricatured drawl) adding charm to the duo&#8217;s respective production and vocal skills. </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038706/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The confounding run of programming continues with UK producer <strong>Gold Panda</strong>, ostensibly complementing the preceding electronic-based set on paper, instead kicking things into overdrive with hard-hitting beats that would find a more conducive home in the early AM. The intensity escalates throughout, swelling to a barnstorming, almost belligerent, tempo at the close.</p>
<p>4.40pm, three acts in, and there&#8217;s a fear day one has reached a crescendo.</p>
<p><strong>King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard</strong> first took to the Supernatural Amphitheatre for Meredith 2011?s opening slot, armed only with a singular EP, Willoughby&#8217;s Beach. They return a little over two years later with an arsenal of four full-length albums. The just-released <em>Oddments* dominates the setlist, showcasing honed songwriting chops alongside their established garage acumen. A penultimate throwback to the anthemic *Willoughby&#8217;s Beach</em> title track gets fists pumping, then a send-off with the sprawling jam ?Head On/Pill?, benefitting from dual drum kits &#8211; perhaps a splurge from a recent <a href="/news/4620076">Indie Music Awards paycheque</a>.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038707/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>While King Gizzard have released a string of albums since their last Meredithian appearance, Melbourne producer <strong>Chet Faker</strong>, aka Nick Murphy, has released zero since his 2012 appearance. The initial buzz still resonates ahead of the impending release of full-length <em>Built On Glass</em>, yet as a performer, Murphy finds himself in a weird conflux between earnest soul singer and sampler-tinkering producer. He fails to captivate in solo mode, lacking visual and tonal substance while exposed on the centre stage platform. A backing band joins the flanks for stripped back soul, at times feeling dreary. The breakthrough cover of Blackstreet&#8217;s ?No Diggity? should really be retired from the setlist at this point in time, rather than serve as lynchpin.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038708/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>After the emotive and minimalist self-titled solo debut, it seems <strong>Adalita</strong> has returned to fully-fledged rockstar mode on the back of <em>All Day Venus</em>, the stark beauty of her previous Meredith appearance parlayed into something resembling shambolic, yet still equally engaging. A spot of guitar smashing sets the bar for the weekend&#8217;s subsequent Australian rock royalty.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038710/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>DW: <strong>Yo La Tengo</strong>?s Ira Kaplan had been sighted earlier at side stage, checking out the first chunk of precocious psych-droners King Gizzard, and YLT themselves are back in Australia after a visit just last November. But familiarity has never hurt the iconic trio &#8211; you can always rely on them to run all over the map live, veering from their prettiest moments to their noisiest in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>So it is with this set, the stubborn opposite of a greatest-hits showing. Sure, they open with the <em>Painful</em> classic ?Big Day Coming? and wring renewed life out of the 1997 single ?Sugarcube?, but they&#8217;re just as happy to plough headfirst into jammier stretches than dole out pretty pop songs. (Although James McNew&#8217;s ?Stockholm Syndrome? is just that, the most instructive lyric being ?Summer&#8217;s what you make it.?) After these years they&#8217;re still just deliriously fun to watch, even if it&#8217;s the umpteenth time you&#8217;ve seen Kaplan go splatter-delic with the electric guitar over McNew and drummer Georgia Hubley&#8217;s steadfast rhythm section. Yo La Tengo are so beloved for good reason: you can hear whole swathes of music history in their songs, but as students they&#8217;re too busy mucking around with the rules to get mired in reverence. They&#8217;re the rebel nerds of indie rock.</p>
<p>LK: Approaching the tail end of a fertile touring cycle for <em>I See Seaweed</em>, <strong>The Drones</strong> project a relaxed air amongst their more beastly, up-tempo selections. They dust off their demented take on John Lennon&#8217;s ?Well Well Well? to conjure a standout magic moment from day one. At first glance there were initial fears Mike Noga had shorn his magnificent locks. Instead, it was previous drummer Christian Strybosch returning to fill in on percussion duties while Noga takes leave of absence.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3038709/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Soul powerhouse <strong>Charles Bradley</strong> overcomes any semblance of diminishing returns, recapturing the magic and emotion of his <a href="/articles/4443625">2012 Golden Plains debut</a> while decked out in a resplendent, vivid crimson suit. ?The World (Is Going Up In Flames)? and ?Why Is It So Hard? are still heart-wrenching standouts, Bradley the embodiment of showmanship with James Brown-invoking stage presence.</p>
<p>Typifying the eclectic nature of the day&#8217;s billing, <strong>Flying Lotus</strong> pulled no punches as he morphed from producer to DJ to rapper behind the layered screens of his three-dimensional performance. It was a mixed bag at times, the diverse nature of the set not always catering to all tastes, yet energy levels were charting in the red more often than not. Spinning Schoolboy Q&#8217;s ?Collard Greens? was an inspired choice.</p>
<p>The intensity of <strong>JPS&#8217;s</strong> set is immense, aided by the Supernatural shed&#8217;s phenomenal lighting array. The huge beats prove to be overwhelming, to the point where I fail to resist the temptation to return to the campsite for a brief respite. The brief respite, of course, turns into a night-ending slumber. Better luck tomorrow.</p>
