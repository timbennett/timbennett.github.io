                <h3>From starting out with the Sydney street press to working his dream job at ?Melody Maker* during the early 1990s, <strong>ANDREW MUELLER</strong> amassed a book&#8217;s worth of anecdotes and wisdom. That book is ?It&#8217;s Too Late to Die Young Now: Misadventures in Rock ?n? Roll?, a rock journalist&#8217;s memoir spanning the tides of grunge, riot grrrl and Britpop. In the extracted chapter below, Mueller scores an interview with his heroes Hoodoo Gurus &#8211; who aren&#8217;t exactly keen on his published opinion. Also making cameos are David Kilgour and John Lydon.

I was getting away with far too much at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=sJdgSRzv8wE">Sydney street press magazine] <em>On the Street</em>. I fumbled a phone interview with fleetingly fashionable chanteuse [Tanita Tikaram</a>, distracted by that morning&#8217;s disconnection of the gas supply to the house in Stanmore. Not only did I spend far too much of the allotted time outlining my rage at this injustice to Tikaram &#8211; who was sympathetic, if bemused &#8211; but I was so consumed that I neglected to depress the red button on my tape recorder. All of which was bad enough, but I then spent the first three paragraphs of the story I subsequently wrote attempting to laugh off this dereliction. Margaret [Cott, editor] really should have applied her blue pencil liberally to my entire introduction, then poked me in the eye with it.</p>
<p>I was, however, discovering what would remain a ceaselessly replenishing joy of the job of being a music journalist &#8211; that of being entranced by something you&#8217;d never heard before, and being in the position to talk to the people responsible for it, and maybe to encourage other people to listen to it. I don&#8217;t recall who first steered me in the direction of Flying Nun, the New Zealand independent label, but they did me a resounding favour. At around this time, Flying Nun were on a roll comparable with the golden eras of any independent label you care to name, having discovered that the small southern college town of Dunedin was apparently entirely populated by people who were in the best rock ?n? roll bands in the world.</p>
<p>These groups visited Sydney regularly, which presented me with the excuse to nag Margaret on their behalf. I duly undertook the exacting trial of a phone interview with the fabulously baleful Shayne Carter of the mighty Straitjacket Fits, a supremely gifted songwriter and guitarist cursed with a maddeningly acute understanding of his band&#8217;s brilliance, and of the awesome unlikelihood of this ever being widely recognised. I sat down in a Sydney pub with the wry, professorial figure of Graeme Downes from The Verlaines &#8211; who, when he wasn&#8217;t singing in the band, was working towards a PhD on Mahler. And I spoke to the monarch of Dunedin&#8217;s unlikely hive, <a href="/articles/4601252">David Kilgour</a> of early 1980s Flying Nun pathfinders The Clean, who offered an explanation for his decision to re-form that seminal band which was a study in the terse matter-of-factness that characterises his people. ?It&#8217;s because,? he said, ?everybody overseas has caught on to The Clean four bloody years after we broke up.?</p>

<p/>
<p>My interviews were still hit-and-miss affairs, partly because I was still trying to figure out how to do them, mostly because all interviews are hit-and-miss affairs, akin to a blind date with an even smaller chance that anyone&#8217;s going to get laid at the end of it. I learnt, also, that a certain amount of tension can help, even if I hadn&#8217;t generated it deliberately. I was thrilled sideways to be interviewing Hoodoo Gurus on the occasion of their fourth album, <em>Magnum Cum Louder*. I had hardly been to a party at which at least one of their first two albums (1984?s glorious *Stoneage Romeos*; 1985?s brilliant, despite dreadfully pallid production, *Mars Needs Guitars</em>) was not played.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;d no more give Hoodoo Gurus a shitty fucking review than I&#8217;d punch my cat.?</p></blockquote>
<p>I arrived at Hoodoo Gurus? manager&#8217;s house in Coogee, the sleeve of <em>Stoneage Romeos</em> and a marker pen wedged into my bag along with my tape recorder, and applied a sweaty, trembling fist to the door. I was ushered into a room where I sat alone for a while. A couple of times I was certain I perceived the iguana-like visage of Hoodoo Gurus singer Dave Faulkner regarding me through an interior window before disappearing. Eventually, I was joined by guitarist Brad Shepherd and bass player Rick Grossman.</p>
<p>?Now,? began Shepherd, ?about that shitty fucking review.?.?.?</p>
<p>I was nonplussed. I loved Hoodoo Gurus. I was pretty certain I&#8217;d said so, often, in print, with my byline attached. I&#8217;d no more give Hoodoo Gurus a shitty fucking review than I&#8217;d punch my cat. I squinted quizzically at Shepherd.</p>
<p>?Of ?Come Anytime?,? he elaborated.</p>
<p>A few weeks previously, I&#8217;d included ?Come Anytime?, the first single from <em>Magnum Cum Louder</em>, in a column rounding up new releases. I&#8217;d opined that, while better than most of its competition, it fell perhaps somewhat short of Hoodoo Gurus? transcendentally lofty standards.</p>
<p>?It&#8217;s a great fucking melody,? persisted Shepherd. ?It&#8217;s just amazing, and I don&#8217;t understand why you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s amazing.?</p>
<p>I rallied slightly, muttering that Hoodoo Gurus? thank-you notes for everything else I&#8217;d written about them seemed to have got lost in the post. Faulkner appeared at the window again, and vanished once more.</p>
<p>?That&#8217;s why we hate rock journalists,? continued Shepherd. ?You guys don&#8217;t print retractions. ?Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I was wrong.? That never happens.?</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/avkOz5wet0Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Shepherd, in fairness, was less diva-ish than the above might make him sound. His complaints were enumerated in the drawling deadpan of a man who believes proceedings to be a mile beneath him, and the rest of the interview went pretty well. Though Faulkner never deigned to join us, and I left with my album unsigned &#8211; I didn&#8217;t ask &#8211; the hostility gave both the interview and the finished piece an edge: it felt like something more than an advertisement for a record. And, at a distance of half a lifetime, upon noting that ?Come Anytime? is the most-played Hoodoo Gurus song in my iTunes library, I&#8217;m prepared to offer Shepherd the following: I was wrong, and I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>On other occasions, I was gifted the kind of interview subjects who do most of the work themselves. Andy Partridge of XTC, phoning from his inexplicable home town of Swindon to discuss the album <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranges<em>%26</em>Lemons_(album">Oranges &amp; Lemons</a>)</em>, was an expansive spirit whose refusal to take anything seriously verged on the heroic, even/especially when asked for his views on the case of an American school student who had compelled his principal&#8217;s secretary, at knifepoint, to play XTC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=hk41Gbjljfo">?Dear God?</a> over the school&#8217;s public address system. ?He should,? said Partridge, ?have taken some hand grenades in with the entire album. Or, you know, ?Play the whole catalogue, I&#8217;ve got a tank outside.??</p>
<blockquote><p>?It was like hearing Nana Mouskouri tell you that she used to sell crack.? </p></blockquote>
<p>John Lydon of Public Image Ltd, on the phone from Los Angeles, reacted to my stammered introduction of myself and my paper with a long, phlegmy sigh, followed by a singsong jeer of, ?Ooh, yippee. My favourite publication.? He spent much of the interview trying to start a fight, before reacting to a question about what he&#8217;d been like at school &#8211; an attempt on my part to head off another of his defensive declamations about his own ironclad integrity, which I wouldn&#8217;t have had the nerve to question even if I wanted to, which I didn&#8217;t &#8211; with a quiet vulnerability.</p>
<p> ?I was dreadful at school,? he said. ?I started out incredibly shy, and very, very quiet. I wouldn&#8217;t even answer a question if the teacher asked because I&#8217;d be so embarrassed. As the years progressed, I steadily got really sick of myself, and decided to do something about it. I learnt to grow up, I learnt not to feel so inadequate. So finally, they eventually threw me out for talking too much, for asking too many questions.? This confession of shame and embarrassment was delivered in the same snotty snarl that scoured The Sex Pistols? ?Pretty Vacant?, and PiL&#8217;s ?Public Image?. It was like hearing Nana Mouskouri tell you that she used to sell crack.</p>

<p/>
<p>There was a reason why a free street paper was getting access to this calibre of artist: lack of competition. Australia had never had an especially vigorous tradition of a rock press, even when it did boast &#8211; as it did, in the late 1980s &#8211; a rock scene of singular vibrancy by any standards, never mind the standards of small islands in the middle of nowhere. In Sydney, <em>On the Street*?s only rivals were a local franchise of *Rolling Stone*, which appeared monthly, and *Rock Australia Magazine* &#8211; known as *RAM</em> &#8211; which appeared weekly.</p>
<p><em>RAM* was a better publication than *OTS* &#8211; it looked nicer, and was better written, and had something resembling a coherent editorial aesthetic. But *RAM* required of its readers that they paid money for it, which rather circumscribed its circulation, which meant *On the Street* had the advertisers, and the pages, and the numbers. We were the *NME* to *RAM*?s *Melody Maker</em>: not as good, but more popular. This is often the way of things, but more so in rock ?n? roll than in most.</p>
