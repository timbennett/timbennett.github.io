                <h3>For their fourth album, &#8216;The Night is Ours&#8217;, Youth Group holed up for couple of months in a 1920s mess hall on Sydney&#8217;s harbour. <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> asks bass player Patrick Matthews why. 
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3000931/440x309-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="309"/><br/>
It&#8217;s two weeks before the release of Youth Group&#8217;s fourth album, <em>The Night Is Ours</em>, and bass guitarist Patrick Matthews is a little concerned. With no big national tour on the horizon &#8211; they&#8217;re launching the album with intimate theatre shows at the Vanguard in Sydney and Manchester Lane in Melbourne &#8211; he was expecting a ?bit more of a splash?.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;re going through stages of elation followed by despondency followed by resignation,? he says over the phone from Mushroom Music&#8217;s Sydney office.</p>
<p>?We got four songs mixed overseas by the guy from Death Cab [Chris Walla]. I thought they were sounding amazing when the mixes were coming back, that was the elation stage &#8211; Then we played our five [pre-launch] shows and got nothing but a couple of interviews. Now we have no [big] shows to celebrate the album coming out.? Are Youth Group back to square one?</p>
<p>After eight years of ?shitty gigs, money issues and day jobs?, not to mention label and line-up changes &#8211; Matthews (ex The Vines) and guitarist Cameron Emerson-Elliott in, Andy Cassell and Johnno Lattin out &#8211; Youth Group finally hit pay day with a cover of Alphaville&#8217;s ?Forever Young?. The song reached number one on ARIA&#8217;s singles chart, but its follow-up album, <em><a href="/releases/5401">Casino Twilight Dogs</a></em> (2006), was not the career-making record Youth Group expected it to be.</p>
<p>?I don&#8217;t think we quite seized the chance that ?Forever Young? gave us in terms of getting more songs on commercial radio,? explains Matthews.<br/>
?We had brand recognition with Toby&#8217;s voice and yet we still didn&#8217;t get added to commercial radio.?</p>
<p>The song has since become a bugbear for the band &#8211; they&#8217;ve effectively dropped it from their set-list and are wary of the one-hit wonder stigma that comes with such a breakthrough release.</p>
<p>??Forever Young? happened and it opened a lot of doors for us. Now, it seems like a big pain in the arse,? Matthews says. ?I still don&#8217;t think the fallout is complete. Maybe it will be six months from now when the [new] album&#8217;s out. You definitely don&#8217;t get away Scott free. There&#8217;s gotta be some trade-off from getting well-known from a cover song.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?There&#8217;s gotta be some trade-off from getting well-known from a cover song.?</p></blockquote>
<p>So when it came to recording <em>The Night is Ours</em>, says Matthews, the band weren&#8217;t concerned about becoming ?the next Eskimo Joe?. Armed with a batch of half-completed songs, they holed up in a rat-infested 1920s mess hall on Sydney&#8217;s harbour with engineers Tim Kevin and Anthony The.</p>
<p>?Cameron has  been to art school, and if art school has taught him anything it&#8217;s that art is as much about the process as it is about the ideas,? Matthews says. ?We wanted a place that sounded good, where we could move all the gear in and set up, that didn&#8217;t cost $1000 a day. The original plan was to get a church hall, because they sound really great, but that idea was pretty hard. ?Well, we have youth group coming in on Friday? &#8211; I mean youth group, as in the kids. So we found this place.?</p>
<p>The seaside mess hall provided a much-needed creative spark. It also imbued the music with a sense of space and eerie tension. On ?Dying at Your Own Party?, a sparse mid-tempo ballad which invokes images of the sea &#8211; ?Struggling against the waves/ Even the seagulls have left me for dead? &#8211; the band sampled noises from the <em>MV Cape Don</em>, a nearby ship which Emerson-Elliott&#8217;s father bought for $4000 in 2003. </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3000933/640x320-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="320"/>
<p>?When we started recording in the mess hall everyone wanted to record something on the ship. Toby [Martin] had written a song about falling off the ship at night. The whole loneliness of the sea suits Toby&#8217;s songs generally,? Matthews says.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the release of <em>The Night is Ours* coincides with Youth Group&#8217;s 10th anniversary. Formed by Martin and drummer Danny Allen, the band played their first gig at the Warren View Hotel in Enmore, Sydney, in 1998. They released their debut LP *Urban &amp; Eastern* in 2000, but it wasn&#8217;t until 2004?s *Skeleton Jar</em> that people started to take notice. In the band&#8217;s bio, Matthews describes Youth Group&#8217;s history as a ?three-act play?. So what does he envision for act number four?</p>
<p>?We are maybe going to go to America next year and give it a proper crack,? he says. ?We went over there a few times for six weeks at a time and did a few tours and we hadn&#8217;t even played the whole of America yet because it&#8217;s so huge &#8211; We did a recent tour of Australia and it lasted three days because you don&#8217;t count Adelaide and Perth these days,? he jokes.</p>
