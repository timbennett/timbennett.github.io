                <h3>Ahead of a joint tour, Melbourne&#8217;s <strong>BAPTISM OF UZI<em>* talk to kraut rock legend *</em>MICHAEL ROTHER</strong> about being an anti-guitar hero, creating Neu!?s 1971 masterpiece ?Hallogallo? and his advice to struggling artists. Rother will play four east-coast shows, including a stint at Adelaide festival, with collaborators Dieter Moebius (Cluster, Harmonia) and Hans Lampe (NEU!, La Dusseldorf). Dates below.

<strong>Some of us were lucky enough to see Harmonia perform at All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties at Mount Buller in 2009. It was a very peaceful performance, in a setting that seemed to enhance the sense of freedom in the music. What kind of experience can we expect on this tour?</strong><br/>
It was a wonderful tour. The location on top of the mountain was so special, the view amazing. A fan sent me a photo which he made of us on stage and right behind us you see clouds and the sky. It looked as if we were playing in mid-air. People were sitting or lying on the ground in that amphitheatre. I&#8217;m sure the absolutely relaxed atmosphere had a positive effect on our music.</p>
<p>The music I&#8217;m preparing for this year&#8217;s tour will be a bit stronger on beats but will also feature some spontaneous free-floating guitar loops which I intend to record live on stage, send through several processors (Kaoss pads etc.) and mix with organised music and sounds from the computer. ?Hallogallo?, the track off the first NEU! album, is still very close to my heart. It reflects the basic idea of an endless music, a straight road ahead. Our focus is set on the horizon and along the way the atmosphere and colours sometimes change.  </p>

<p/>
<p>**The first Neu! album was recorded over four nights without any<br/>
prior rehearsals &#8211; you&#8217;ve stated before that you worked like [?action<br/>
painters?](http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=7bICqvmKL5s). What&#8217;s the<br/>
relationship between improvisation and structure in your live and<br/>
recorded work these days?**<br/>
In recent years I&#8217;ve become more interested in playing live as opposed to working behind closed doors on music for records. I just confirmed my participation with a solo performance at ATP&#8217;s ?I&#8217;ll Be Your Mirror? in Japan in April. Jim O&#8217;Rourke is the curator and he invited me to join him and some other artists he chose. The element of surprise in a live situation, the possibility of interaction with the crowd listening, the shared excitement &#8211; all that I enjoy very much. My music is balanced between improvisation and structure, and it is great that with today&#8217;s technology I can change the balance at any time. </p>
<p>**The different personalities you have worked with strongly<br/>
influence the sounds you have been a part of. Klaus Dinger is an<br/>
interesting figure who seemed to create an almost mythical character<br/>
for himself in performance and his approach to music. Does personal<br/>
tension always result in musical tension? What&#8217;s the chemistry like<br/>
between you, Dieter [Moebius] and Hans [Lampe]?**<br/>
Differences in personality are probably always helpful if you wish to create a music that reflects tension and opposing ideas. However, the collaborations in the past were not chosen with that in mind. It just happened to be the case. If I look at the musicians I have worked with in the early years &#8211; Florian Schneider, Klaus Dinger, Hans-Jochim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius &#8211; all of them have very different traits, temperaments and musical/biographical backgrounds. With Florian and Klaus it was rather difficult on a personal level but totally exciting once we started playing music together. With Roedelius and Moebius it was different. Although we are really also quite different from one another in character we managed to live together in one big house (by the river Weser in Forst, Germany) for more than three years. I know the qualities Dieter Moebius brings into the music today. He is great at spontaneously adding surprising and sometimes odd elements which probably no one else would have thought of. He will add these &#8220;spices&#8221; to my music. With Hans it&#8217;s a different situation because we haven&#8217;t played together since Hans joined us to play drums on the second side of <em>NEU! ?75</em> in 1974 but I&#8217;m optimistic. He is a friendly and enthusiastic person and I&#8217;m sure he will do a great job at adding the fast-forward drive I need. </p>
<p>**The term ?guitar hero? can be used as negative reference<br/>
(bombastic, egotistical, masturbatory) and a positive reference (Wim<br/>
Wenders speaking about Rowland S Howard in the recent documentary <em><a href="/news/4304436">Autoluminescent</a></em>). I see you as a kind of<br/>
guitar antihero; using the loudness and sounds of a guitar hero but<br/>
with melodic lines antithetical to speed or flashiness. What do you<br/>
make of this term? And what do you think when it is applied to you?**<br/>
When I started making music as a teenager I looked up to those guitar heroes and I learned how to play guitar by copying them. It amuses me today when I think how I tried to be a Jimi Hendrix impersonator at the age of 17. The music of Hendrix, his sensitivity and the way he treated the guitar to make it fly had such an impact on me, and he is still a great inspiration, but I completely stopped playing fast-finger guitar solos at the age of 19 or 20. It dawned on me that I had to forget all the rock cliches and steer away from my heroes in order to find my own individual musical personality. There are a lot of possibilities to create music on the guitar that have nothing to do with rock guitar heroism. Although the guitar is still my first instrument, it&#8217;s the whole picture of the music that interests me, not the performance of an individual instrumentalist.</p>

<p/>
<p>**One of the wonderful things about listening to ?Hallogallo? is the<br/>
beautiful clean and controlled feedback that you managed to produce.<br/>
What sort of equipment did you use to get this sound? Was there any<br/>
sort of compression or sustain? Is there a piece of equipment that has<br/>
most contributed to your guitar sound over the years?**<br/>
My gear was very simple when we recorded the first NEU! album in 1971. It was more or less still the same standard rock musician gear which I had used in the years before for a very different kind of music: fuzz box, wah pedal. In 1971 I only added a filter box and a delay machine &#8211; and that was it. I had a Gibson Les Paul guitar (plus an old bass from the late-?50s and a modification of my first electric guitar which I called &#8220;Dehgitarre&#8221; and used for tracks like ?Weissensee?). I used Altec Lansing speakers.</p>
<p>Recording ?Hallogallo? this wonderful feedback occurred, and of course I immediately used it to play those endless guitar notes. Conny Plank [German producer who worked on many of the<br/>
great ambient/experimental German albums of the ?70s] added some compression and mixed the guitar overdubs playing backwards and forwards with the limited studio gear that was available back then in an amazing way. We owe Conny so much for his wonderful contributions to our records. In the mid-?70s a group of musicians/technicians nearby who built electronic gear made a special fuzz box for me. It offered a unique sound and you can hear it on all my albums since the mid-?70s. Today I use a fuzz box that was built as a copy of that model. The guy who made it told me that the circuit diagram of the original fuzz contains some kind of mistake. Maybe it is this fault that contributed to the special sound and so we stuck to that wonderful mistake.   </p>

<p/>
<p>**The synthesiser has a very human sound that creates an emotional<br/>
reaction for me. Sometimes I feel like the guitar is limited in<br/>
texture and sonic possibilities. What is the difference for you in<br/>
synth and guitar playing?**<br/>
In the past 40 years I&#8217;ve used guitars, synthesizers, electronic drum machines, computers and basically any electronic or non-electronic sound emitting device I could find and which inspired me. In the early-?70s it stopped being important for me which instrument I used because I didn&#8217;t consider myself a guitar player any more. My focus since then was on the whole musical picture. The best expression for an idea was what mattered. You could say the studio became my instrument. I neglected the guitar for many years &#8211; more or less all through the ?90s &#8211; because I too felt more attracted by the world of synthetic sound creation. These days I very much enjoy playing guitar again and it&#8217;s the combination of electronics and guitar that interests me most.</p>
<p>**In previous interviews, you&#8217;ve talked about the difficulties of<br/>
working as a musician in the 1970s, when critics weren&#8217;t really<br/>
interested in the music you were making. It appears that you&#8217;ve had<br/>
sufficient <em>langer atem</em> (a German term you&#8217;ve used in the past meaning<br/>
sustained breath, or something similar) to withstand the turbulence and<br/>
make it through to a point where you&#8217;re able to see your earlier work<br/>
reach new levels of acclaim. With that in mind, how did you survive in<br/>
the 1970s and what advice can you offer young musicians full of vision<br/>
but empty of stomach?**<br/>
It&#8217;s so difficult to compare the situation being an experimental musician in Germany in the early-?70s to the situation young musicians find today. Back then, there was a vast open space in music for us to discover and where we could leave our marks. Today, musicians know much more about what is happening around the world and what has already been done. It must be much more difficult today to find an open space and avoid being influenced. In the early-?70s we were quite alone. That made it difficult to survive economically and to find an audience but we were free and didn&#8217;t have high expectations on the economical level. I was lucky because the moderate commercial success of NEU! carried me through the period of economical disaster that followed with Harmonia. I am  reluctant to give advice especially because everyone has a different situation but one thing is certainly always true: You have to be ready to struggle and accept the risk of failure if you leave trodden ground behind and instead follow your heart and own convictions.   </p>

<p>**I first heard your solo work on a great community radio show in<br/>
Melbourne called <em>Beat Orgy* [on Triple R]. Melbourne has an enthusiastic community of listeners and musicians. The German music scene in the 1970s seemed to be very tight knit. Many musicians were collaborating and moving through bands. Do you still work within a community in Germany? How has the internet affected your connection to a music community?*</em><br/>
I especially look forward to our concert in Melbourne because I remember we had a very enthusiastic crowd when we played there in 2009.<br/>
In the ?70s there weren&#8217;t many musicians around which I knew of and who interested me. The musicians who really inspired me were the ones I collaborated with: Florian Schneider, Klaus Dinger, Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius, and Conny Plank as engineer and co-producer. We were all very different in character, temperament and musical identity, but we definitely had something in common and this was our wish: to be innovative and develop an individual music. </p>
<p>Jaki Liebezeit is a fantastic drummer. Quite different in temperament and style from Klaus Dinger, but just as convincing. He was my natural choice when I recorded my first four solo albums and he contributed wonderful beats and demonstrated his great intuition when we recorded my first solo albums. Although I enjoy collaborating with other musicians I still work as a solo musician most of the time. Since the late-?90s it has become much easier to communicate and to exchange information around the globe. The arrival of the internet and email has made it possible to stay in touch and work on projects with other artists far away but the downside is that I spend far too much time on the computer. This is a problem and I&#8217;m still looking for the best balance. </p>
<blockquote><p>?You have to be ready to struggle and accept the risk of failure if you leave trodden ground behind and instead follow your heart and own convictions.?</p></blockquote>
<p>**For me as a listener, your music makes me become more patient. I<br/>
am no longer listening for the instant pleasure of pop music; I have<br/>
to change my expectations. In this way I find that it is meditative.<br/>
How do you see the listener? Is the creative process as meditative for<br/>
you as is listening for me?**<br/>
I don&#8217;t know. Experience tells me that people listen to music in an individual way and I&#8217;m sometimes surprised by what they experience when listening to my music. This is quite mysterious but probably understandable if you think of acrobats: when you see them perform it looks easy, as if anyone could do it but the truth is that it takes hard work to make it look easy. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that the creation of art can be the result of hard work and still sound simple; or it can be the other way around, sound complicated and complex when it is really the result of a simple trick.</p>
<p>In the end, the only thing that matters to me is the emotional quality and intellectual strength of an idea. My music is a combination of inspiration/intuition &#8211; this part is not predictable &#8211; and organisational processes which quite often include periods of frustration.</p>
<p>**Regarding Conny Plank, you said he contributed a lot of creativity to the recording process. Can you tell us what sort of things he felt were<br/>
important in the recording process and can you remember any particular<br/>
tricks he used to get those excellent drum sounds?**<br/>
Conny Plank was a great person and full of creative ideas. He once explained his working method as (roughly translated), &#8220;Bend everything upside down and inside out?, which meant to say he was looking for new ways to record and organise music. This was exactly the same attitude we had. The important thing was to use the available (limited) gear in a new way and with a new idea. Conny experimented a lot with different microphones for the best drum sound. In the early-?70s I had no clue of these matters. The result of Conny&#8217;s work was amazing. I picked up a lot by watching and collaborating with him. His contribution to our albums and his methods of production still inspire me.</p>
<p>**In the past you&#8217;ve spoken of the value of trying to avoid clich&#8217;s<br/>
in music and produce something original. Considering the dramatic<br/>
proliferation in the amount of music being made do you think it is<br/>
getting harder for musicians to be original or is that just an excuse?**<br/>
Yes, I think it has definitely become harder to avoid being influenced. Music is everywhere today, it surrounds you whether you like it or not. It&#8217;s hard to imagine that there was only one real music show for young people in the late-?60s/early-?70s on German TV [<em>Beat Club</em>] and hardly any music for us on the radio either. I&#8217;m sure today it&#8217;s still possible to steer away from musical ideas that have already been defined and to try and find new fields for oneself but the sheer amount of information available today is a challenge. </p>

<p>**While you Dieter and Hans are flying to each show we&#8217;ll be making<br/>
a 3500 kilometre round journey in an old faux-wood lined wagon. Can you<br/>
recommend us an album or two that you&#8217;ve been enjoying recently that<br/>
may help lubricate the road and place us in a zen garden ready for the<br/>
shows?**<br/>
Difficult question. I enjoy the sound of silence most of the time and if I play music it can be from all genres, directions and times. Today, when I sat in a cafe with a friend they were playing Fado music from Portugal. I love that beautiful melancholic music. If I were driving in a car like you &#8211; in the Australian summer &#8211; I&#8217;d probably also love to listen to the sound of the wind and to other sounds of nature on the way!</p>
