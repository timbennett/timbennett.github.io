                <h3>In the final installment of their US tour diary, <strong>AMY FRANZ<em>* and *</em>HAYLEY MCKEE</strong> from Melbourne&#8217;s Super Wild Horses get some ink done in New Orleans, are struck down by the ?Pavement curse? in Austin and play a fierce set in San Fran. Part one <a href="/articles/4150008">here</a>.
</h3>
<h2>New Orleans</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016925/440x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
New Orleans is a mouldy, humid, charming and intense city. We arrive when a New Orleans Saints game has just been won. Pandemonium and dancing in the streets mean all taxis and public transport grind to a halt for a few hours. Waiting in line for a cab to the French Quarter, the idea of a shower becomes a taunting, elusive dream. We finally make it to our little hotel &#8211; heaven on a shoestring. The excitement of a new city takes over and we skip showering and food to explore Jackson Square. The buskers are heartfelt and overwhelmingly talented. </p>
<p>Frenchman Avenue is where we spend our evening soaking up the bars and music. It feels so refreshing to hear so many different styles and there&#8217;s a band on every street corner here &#8211; from swing (in a tiny bar packed full of dancers and people hootin? and hollerin?) to Appalachian folk, Cajun and New Orleans blues.</p>
<p>As we spoil ourselves with cocktails, the skies unleash torrential rain. Hot and heavy raindrops drench the city in a cool change and create a celebration on the sidewalks. Out of nowhere a python-clad man wearing a bra and dirty Mohawk emerges from the dark. We get chatting and ultimately snapping with some photos to remember him by.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016926/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Day 14:</strong></p>
<p>Today we hit voodoo museums and get new tattoos. In the evening we head to a cavernous, dusty bar called Saturn Bar, run by the ballsy and wise Bridget, who ensures all the bands are well lubricated before the show.<br/>
There are about 100 people here for the gig and it&#8217;s an intimate, low-key night that&#8217;s loads of fun. Legendary Wings play before us and we pull through a short set. The two other bands we played with (whose names have escaped us) are great as well. After the show the bands pile onto the streets to hang out and we marvel at their bandwagon covered entirely in shag-pile carpet. A late night cab home via drive in McDonald&#8217;s, where we discover McMuffins here are called McBiscuits, and are fucking delicious. Pass out.</p>
<p><strong>Day 15:</strong></p>
<p>Early flight to Austin via Dallas. We&#8217;re both feeling really run down and vague now. Hayley loses her voice and Amy forgets she has firecrackers in her handbag, yet somehow manages to get through customs in both NOLA and Dallas. Kaboom.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Austin</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016927/440x600-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We get to Austin and head to Timmy&#8217;s house. Timmy booked our New Orleans and two Austin shows and has lent us his couch for our stay here. He shares his pad with Charlie who consumes on average of 13 cans of Diet Coke a day and at the time of our introduction is hell-bent on finding a way to make a million dollars by the end of the year. They pretty up their house with death metal posters, and listen to bad ass hip-hop through subwoofer speakers in Charlie&#8217;s car. They are the acest pair of dudes we could have hoped for and they bend over backwards to show us a great time.</p>
<p>We nap for an hour before heading to the drug store for health cures and throat numbing sprays. Illness is lurking. Austin is a vibrant, green, sunny city filled with junk shops, ?50s neon signs and an out-of-control live music scene. Great venues, great temperature &#8211; we contemplate moving.</p>
<p>Tonight we play at a venue named Beerland. This is the second or third time we&#8217;ve arrived in a new city on this tour, only to find Pavement are playing the same night as us. We love this band immensely but can&#8217;t help feeling disappointed that understandably, lots of people will be going to see them instead of us. Hayley is convinced we have a Pavement curse caused by us touching their gear boxes backstage at <a href="/events/2002524">Golden Plains</a> when we had to use their caravan before our set.</p>
<p>We ignore the curse for the night and instead get to enjoy their impeccable set from the surrounds of a multi level car park. We&#8217;re sleepy and bleary from the cold and flu drugs and eventually float down to play our show.</p>
<p>First up are Hatchet Wound, an ESG style duo with a wandering front-woman swaying behind a microphone and tambourine. Following on from them are Hozac label buddies Rayon Beach. Their vintage amps and keys are beautiful and really make their sound. A Giant Dog is a super energetic band with singer dancing around in a high-cut leotard. We hit the stage for a very sluggish, head in the swamp set. Probably our worst one yet. We&#8217;re pretty disappointed and by now feeling the full force of some kind of flu &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t help to learn that Matador were in the crowd to see us. Bummer.</p>
<p>An early night sidled up against Vicks Vapor Rub and ginger tea. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016928/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Day 16:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like BBQ ribs for breakfast! A red meat morning gets us ready for our tour of the city, stopping at junk shops and record stores for a bit more unnecessary shopping. Back at Timmy&#8217;s house Amy takes a nap and Hayley sits on the front porch with more ginger tea and watches the fireflies at dusk. We get changed and head to the show.<br/>
Club 1808 is a whack little bar on the wrong side of town, which is what makes it so right. Jamaican vibes and Christmas lights create a bizarre atmosphere complete with a mirrored ?stage?. Hayley asks why the alleyway in the beer garden is so busy. We&#8217;re informed it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s main score spot for crack.</p>
<p>Tonight is a secret show with <em>Pitchfork</em> babes Woven Bones. They&#8217;d played the night before with Pavement and signed a contract to ensure they wouldn&#8217;t play any gigs either side. We were lucky they dug our record and wanted to break the rules to play alongside us. Word of mouth was the only way of knowing about the gig. Soft Healer was up before us, a sparse, psychedelic jam band with really interesting songs. Thank god we redeemed ourselves tonight and played a much tighter show. Partied hard in celebration of our return to form and marvelled at our name in lights at the front of the venue. </p>
<p><strong>Day 17:</strong></p>
<p>We woke late and had a great spicy Mexican lunch with Rayon Beach and Woven Bones kids (including avocado margaritas, which were amazing). Hunted for religious sculptures in a great Chapel St Bazaar style store and then headed to an outdoor concert with Times New Viking and Guided By Voices. A day in the sun and long grass did just the trick, and we retired to Timmy&#8217;s house to pack and set the alarm for an early start to the airport the next morning. Timmy continues to party with Times New Viking. We get some shut eye.</p>
<p><strong>Day 18:</strong></p>
<p>Amy manages to set the alarm wrong by one hour, and our much needed rest is shattered by this realisation. Hayley emerges from the bedroom wearing a Times New Viking shirt (recently bought and her only clean one) only to be greeted by the band in Timmy&#8217;s lounge room. Embarrassing moment.</p>
<p>Hit the airport. Eat more BBQ. Look at size of expanding asses. Vow to not eat anymore BBQ.</p>
<p/>
<h2>San Francisco</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3016929/440x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
This is the last stop on the tour and we&#8217;re amazed how fast it has come. We feel like we&#8217;ve been away forever but know it will feel like a blink of an eye to our friends and family back home. Today we have a guest DJ spot on college radio station KUSF FM. It&#8217;s great trawling through the racks of records and picking out our favourite tunes. Hayley asks someone if there&#8217;s any Medication (the band) and is told there was some weed earlier but it all got smoked. Our phone skills come in handy as we talk to ring-ins. Amy can&#8217;t get one guy off the phone and continues her conversation on air. Lots of fun.<br/>
Our show tonight is at The Hemlock. Prepare for the gig stealing peanuts from the table next door and drinking wine in the ally with Royal Baths kids.</p>
<p>This became both our favourite show of the tour. The first band So So Glows didn&#8217;t hit the spot for us and looked liked they&#8217;d emerged from The Peach Pit <em>90210</em> style. But the next band Royal Baths totally blew us away. They played with absolute power and dark beauty. Inspirational stuff. Instead of scaring the shit out of us as we were playing next, they gave us a kick up the ass and we played a fierce set. Sweat soaked, torn vocal shrieks and all. Sick balls.</p>
<p>Feeling all wired after our set, we escaped out into the alleyway and missed the first half of The Mantles show. We only caught the last few songs, including the excellent ?Don&#8217;t Lie?. They were pretty unhappy with their set, but we were real impressed with the tunes. The owner of the venue plies us with shots and Jeremy from Royal Baths graffitis our name all over the band room.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Davis</h2>
<p><strong>Day 19:</strong></p>
<p>Today we play our last show for the tour at Opertaion Restore Maximum Freedom Festival, run by college radio station KDVS. The festival is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by corn fields and a road house. Luckily the trip from San Fran gives us time to recoup from the night before.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016931/336x448-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There are a whole swag of bands playing today, including the Ganglians, Psychic Realities, Wounded Lion, Mattress and The Fresh and Onlys. There&#8217;s a really nice feeling in the air, everyone&#8217;s set up on picnic blankets and exercising their right to maximum freedom. In passing, Hayley mentions to the stage manager how nice it would be to play on the grass instead of up on stage. We&#8217;re eating a quintessential roadhouse meal when the manager runs up to us and tells us they&#8217;ve swapped the line-up around so we can play on the grass and we&#8217;re on now. We&#8217;re thrown into a bit of a panic as we didn&#8217;t realise they&#8217;d take the comment seriously and try and set-up still shoving onion rings in our mouth. Last set &#8211; not the most memorable except for us only getting halfway through the last song before a major stuff up makes the last half unsalvageable. Super Wild Horses, always the consummate professionals! Deciding not to stay the night, we bum a lift back to the city with Young Prisms, a bunch of great people and their adopted dog. There are six of us and two bands? gear in the car (plus the dog). The driver is really stoned and we are massively relieved when we make it back alive. They drop us off on their street, the very same one that features in the TV series <em>Full House*. We run through the park, elated and laugh at the house with a notice on the wall stating, ?This is NOT the *Full House</em> house.? It so obviously is. We head to El Rio to watch Royal Baths again and then back to Jeremy Bath&#8217;s house, set high on a San Franciscan hill with a rooftop greenhouse that was to become our bedroom for the night. It&#8217;s a million-dollar view that will be forever etched in our memories.</p>
<p><strong>Day 20:</strong></p>
<p>Along with the Royal Baths, we walk to Golden Gate Park where the Not Strictly Bluegrass Festival is happening. It&#8217;s a free event attracting more than 650,000 people over three days. We arrive just in time to see Patti Smith. She plays a mind blowing set and all the old San Fran hippies are out in force singing along. It&#8217;s amazing when you get to see such charismatic front-people take to the stage in before a massive crowd. We unfortunately miss Elvis Costello, who played the day before, but catch Emmylou Harris from a great vantage point in the bush on a hill.</p>
<p>Feeling beat, we eat some food and go back to our hotel to pack. Watch <em>Get Him To The Greek</em>. Start feeling a bit sad that it&#8217;s all coming to an end. Nostalgia kicks in. Then sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Day 21:</strong></p>
<p>Hayley buys a beautiful old Harmony Guitar and it&#8217;s a great way to end the tour &#8211; with the purchase of something that will bring life to our next batch of songs.</p>
<p>At the airport we split: Amy on a flight home via LA, and Hayley off to Hawaii to bask in the sun. We hug each other goodbye and promise we&#8217;ll come back again soon.</p>
