                <h3>With their second album, Total Control challenge as many expectations as they exceed. ?Typical System? plays like the Gilgamesh of outsider Australian music, writes <strong>MAX EASTON</strong>.
</h3>

The cover of Total Control&#8217;s second LP, <em>Typical System</em>, features an image of one of the Pope&#8217;s doves in the process of being caught and killed by a wild crow. In this shot, a seagull also appears, flying absurdly in the opposite direction. The photo is then defaced by scribbling at the edges and a typeface that&#8217;s on par in offensiveness with Comic Sans or Papyrus. The cover has as many symbolic impressions as it does seemingly bad ideas, but <a href="http://www.messandnoise.com/images/3022922/600&#215;600-c.jpeg">that&#8217;s</a> Total Control. After all, the record itself includes their most ambitious pop song to date (?Flesh War?), a littering of ludicrous bridges and a pseudo-lounge track called ?Liberal Party?. With their second album, Total Control challenge just as many expectations as they exceed.</p>
<p>Vocalist Dan Stewart has stated previously that Total Control is a deeper lyrical vessel for him &#8211; a place to emote without the confines of a theme &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean he derails into verbosity. Like the rapid-fire criticisms he delivers through layers of spittle as frontman of <a href="/releases/2001169">Straightjacket Nation</a>, repetition and sloganeering takes the lyrical fore. Many of these lines are repeated like mantras, hypnotically looping around the progressively darkening jams with increasing motivation. Lines like ?You and your words? seem to gradually meld into ?You at your worst? on ?Liberal Party?; ?At the breaking of the day? stirs from a nothing introductory passage to an arresting time-setter on ?Flesh War?; and the repeated affirmations of ?Safety Net? gradually sinks in until becoming meaningful. The songs exist in a melodramatic world of anxiety and aggression, one where scenarios are obsessed over to lend significance to the miniscule.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142250662&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><em>Typical System* is full of intricately crafted details plied by any one of their six members. The synths and drum machine of Stewart find company with Zephyr Pavey&#8217;s bass and the three guitars of Mikey Young, Al Montfort and David West, all wrapped around the manic drums of James Vinciguerra. It&#8217;s a more inflated roster than the one that crafted the landmark first record *<a href="/releases/2000921">Henge Beat</a></em>, but their second is sleeker and more refined, even when it thrashes into disarray. Where the jam on ?Black Spring? hangs by a thread from complete collapse, ?Safety Net? and ?Flesh War? feel immaculately controlled. It feels so good to listen to because the band have found expertise in assembling their many elements to manipulate mood, whether through overwrought shifts or tentative interjections.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The perceived evolution is from a synth-punk sensibility into a world of finely layered pop songs.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The perceived evolution of Total Control is from a synth-punk sensibility into a world of finely layered pop songs. With the band beginning as offshoots from Straightjacket Nation (Dan Stewart, Al Montfort) and Eddy Current Suppression Ring (Mikey Young), its roster has now seen side projects that include the chic dance tracks of <a href="/search/?q=Lace+Curtain">Lace Curtain</a> (Young, West, Vinciguerra) and considered guitar-pop of <a href="/search/?q=rat+columns">Rat Columns</a> (West). Where the ruggedness on their first record was relentless, their second reflects the lightness of the band members? more recent projects. But even if it was an increasingly collaborative atmosphere that has entered the recording of this LP, it&#8217;s not like you couldn&#8217;t have seen this coming. Interim releases like the <em><a href="/releases/2000737">Paranoid Video</a></em> 7? and the alternate-version single of <a href="/news/4514895">?Carpet Rash?</a> have hinted at measured electronic purges (the latter even featured <a href="https://soundcloud.com/homeloanrecords/b1-total-control-carpet-club">club mixes</a> by Perth&#8217;s Michael Ozone on the B-side.) This has always been on the cards, but with powerhouse moments like ?Systematic Fuck?, the record tends to average out everything they&#8217;re capable of. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142250709&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>That&#8217;s where <em>Typical System* succeeds most strongly. This is as much a piece of standout musicianship as it is an ode to everything that&#8217;s happening around them. All the bands that make up their contemporaries (many of whom they&#8217;re a part of themselves) are reflected somehow within this record. The synth bands, guitar acts, the punks and dance troupes all feel present in this record somehow, highlighting the depths to which Total Control have influenced the microcosm of music that exists around them. *Typical System</em> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> of outsider Australian music, and it&#8217;s a record so powerful that it can be accepted not just by the niche audiences it has always fuelled, but in a context broad enough to reach both the national broadcaster and mainstream international audiences. Enlighteningly, Total Control gave nothing up to get there.</p>
<p><em>Typical System* is an impressive record. It thrives constantly throughout its duration, and the band&#8217;s ambitions to create good songs are felt powerfully throughout. As shotgun as its approach can sometimes seem, it&#8217;s not just spat out in a flurry of ideas; rather, it paints with broad strokes across the entirety of the band members? skillset. But little else could be expected from the band that created *Henge Beat</em>, easily one of the best local records of the decade. That its sequel can almost match that in its seamlessness and manipulation of mood should be of no surprise to anyone. </p>
