                <h3><strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> talks to Max Kohane (aka Max Crumbs) about learning his craft, finding inspiration on the road, collaborating and how Brain Children bandmate Mikey Young is too self-conscious to sing.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3029219/440x589-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Known formerly as Crumbs, Max Crumbs is the production outlet of Melbourne&#8217;s tireless Max Kohane. Trailing a long list of former bands, Kohane still juggles genres as drummer for grindcore champs Agents of Abhorrence and his experimental duo Pivixki with Anthony Pateras, as half of the pop-damaged electronic duo Brain Children with Eddy Current Suppression Ring&#8217;s Mikey Young and as singer of the lesser-known grindcore trio Internal Rot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his debut Max Crumbs album <em>Maidenhair* on Sensory Projects develops the splintered production of his earlier *<a href="/releases/2000542">Pieces &amp; Portions</a></em> EPs into something more spacious, psychedelic and swirled with sunny pop brightness. It&#8217;s still head-nodding and wavering, though, in keeping with Kohane&#8217;s association with Melbourne&#8217;s <a href="/articles/4407534">//This Thing// Collective</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You were originally planning to compile your two <em>Pieces &amp; Portions</em> EPs for Sensory Projects but decided to just make a new record. Why?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m still learning how to do it all. I&#8217;m still learning to use my machinery the way I want to. And I&#8217;m still learning how to, I guess, make a proper record not relying on anyone else. Just myself. So I thought it would be a bit of a cop-out, in a sense. I was really happy someone wanted to release it, but I thought I could do better.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3029222/400x534-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Was it partly because those EPs were already out as free downloads?</strong><br/>
That was big part of it too. I thought it&#8217;d be a bit weird having someone be charged for a record that&#8217;s been out there for download for a year or so. [<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;d be a bit cheeky. But it was mainly about quality control: those ones are free and hopefully I could make something someone [would pay] for. Plus it&#8217;s more fun to have a goal, y&#8217;know? Get the record done and say you&#8217;ve got a record, instead of two downloadable EPs.</p>
<p><strong>Did the record take a long time compared to the EPs?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it took forever. [<em>Laughs</em>] [Sensory Projects owner] Steve [Phillips] was really patient with me. I thought I&#8217;d get him something finished within about a five-month period, because I&#8217;d done the EPs really quickly and I thought it was gonna be this swift thing where I&#8217;d just concentrate after coming home from tour. But it didn&#8217;t turn out like that at all. It probably took me a year-and-a-half. I was about a year or a year-and-a-half late [compared] to what I told Steve.</p>
<p><strong>Why did it take so long? Did you have trouble self-editing?</strong><br/>
Yeah, that was a bit of it. I definitely was getting overcritical and I was throwing out beats left right and centre just because it wasn&#8217;t good enough. I got a bit heady with it all, but also I was pretty busy with my other music so I wasn&#8217;t really around to just concentrate in a room with my toys.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re still doing Agents of Abhorrence. Is Brain Children still happening too?</strong>  </p>
<p>Yeah, me and Mikey <a href="/news/3634193">Young] still make music together. It&#8217;s just one of those things that comes and goes. After we did that [Brain Children] [record</a>, we had a lot of unreleased stuff just sitting around, which is still sitting around. We hope to get a record out this year, but I think it&#8217;s more an excuse to hang out and trade sounds and play music with each other. We&#8217;re DJing more together than anything.</p>
<p><strong>And <a href="/releases/2000740">Pivixki</a>?</strong><br/>
Yeah, Pivixki as well. That was pretty busy up until earlier this year. That was the main thing I was doing last year, during the process of making the Crumbs record. I was traveling a lot and just spending a lot of time doing that with Anthony [Pateras].</p>
<p><strong>Is that what you were touring for?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I toured with Agents last year a bit, and I did two different tours with Pivixki last year, one through Europe and one through America and Canada. Another band I was singing in, called Internal Rot, did [that] tour as well.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3029221/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>I was going to ask you about singing, because some of the people in Melbourne doing similar production stuff sing as well as all the production.</strong><br/>
That band&#8217;s name is Internal Rot, so you can kind of picture what it sounds like. I guess I&#8217;m not really ?singing.? [<em>Laughs</em>] On a few of the earlier Crumbs songs I sing. There&#8217;s no singing on the album, but I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m not that comfortable with it. I sang on all the Brain Children songs on the EP, because Mikey and I couldn&#8217;t really find anyone to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Mikey didn&#8217;t want to sing?</strong><br/>
Oh, god no. He would never sing. He was singing on some of the songs, and then in the mix he would drag himself right down practically so you couldn&#8217;t hear. He&#8217;s very paranoid in that regard. Some call it ?humble?, but I think he&#8217;s just paranoid. [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p><strong>I was going to ask too if the touring you did informed this record, whether thematically or just hearing from new sounds in different places.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Being away or traveling or touring &#8211; wherever it takes you &#8211; helps a lot in the sense that whenever I&#8217;m away, the first thing I&#8217;ll do is go to a record store. Or see who&#8217;s playing and find out what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s a good way to find new sounds, rather than continually visiting the same spots in Melbourne. I had more time on my [recent] tours than I usually had, so I ended up going to a lot of places specifically trying to find bits and pieces for the record.</p>
<p>But the more tours I do, the more I realise how much I love Melbourne. So it&#8217;s all about me coming back to Melbourne: come back to my place in Carlton, sit in a room for a really long time and make a record, even though I actually didn&#8217;t have time to do that for most of that year. I felt like I was getting little bits and pieces &#8211; little treats &#8211; and bringing them back home.</p>
<p><strong>When you go to record stores, are you getting things for sampling or just things that might inspire your work?</strong><br/>
A bit of everything. I like so much music. When I&#8217;m really looking for stuff to sample, I&#8217;ve got like a little point mechanism. If I pull out a record that&#8217;s got a good cover and it&#8217;s produced in an era that I like the recording style of or something like that, I skip through it looking for three or four points that make it a great record for me to sample rather than the actual music being amazing. It could be just a snare hit or something weird. But both are pretty essential. I often find random stuff I&#8217;ve been looking for for a long time.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Speaking of record stores, I saw you play on <a href="/galleries/4459043">Record Store Day</a> at Polyester in Melbourne. Do you do many live performances as Crumbs?</strong><br/>
No, I haven&#8217;t yet. I&#8217;ve done probably two or three now, including that one. So it&#8217;s definitely something I haven&#8217;t yet mastered and don&#8217;t know which avenues to take, as far as making that a much more impressive thing to watch. Or sound.</p>
<p><strong>It sounded great, but when it&#8217;s just one person doing stuff like that?</strong><br/>
Yeah, exactly. That&#8217;s why I was hoping people would keep shopping while I played. [Laughs] So they wouldn&#8217;t need to look and just go, ?Ah, yeah.? I&#8217;ve got to work on it a lot. It also helps to have a dark room and a big sound system for that kind of thing. But it was never my goal to make it a live thing, because I do live things in other [bands]. I&#8217;ve felt in the last couple months not that I have to, but that it could be something I could play out live and show people my music a bit more. But it definitely needs a lot more work.</p>
<p><strong>And you&#8217;re playing this Saturday [May 5] in Melbourne?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve got the launch. It was organised really quickly because the record just came out but I&#8217;m going on tour in a couple weeks and I just needed to do something. Friends of mine, like Galapagoose and Dylan [Michel, aka Wooshie] and Andras Fox, are all releasing records around the same time and they&#8217;re all part of that //This Thing// project. We just needed to pull something together.</p>
<p><strong>You said you&#8217;re touring after the launch. Is that as Crumbs?</strong><br/>
No, that&#8217;s Agents. An American tour. So I&#8217;ll be nicking off for a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m still learning to use my machinery the way I want to. And I&#8217;m still learning how to, I guess, make a proper record not relying on anyone else.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your relationship with //This Thing//? How much do you hang out with those guys and compare notes?</strong><br/>
I mean, a lot of those guys &#8211; everyone comes from a different place in that scene, and Dylan comes from a bit of a punk and hardcore background as well. I knew him through a friend of mine when he first moved over [from Perth]. He was pretty instrumental in bouncing ideas off and trying to establish something we could grow together. He introduced me to a lot of amazing artists. Most of the roster&#8217;s pretty amazing in my eyes. I guess I get to look at what they&#8217;re doing and see how I could relate it to myself, because I never really had that contact. It was always me alone, for a number of years, just with the MPC. Most of my friends don&#8217;t listen to that kind of music, or just think it&#8217;s elevator music. [<em>Laughs</em>] Not as immediate and great as their music. I guess that&#8217;s been instrumental for me.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering how much you see your background in heavier music come out in Crumbs. There&#8217;s a bit of ?Choked on Yoga Mat? that I felt was more menacing.</strong><br/>
Um, I kind of don&#8217;t remember what that song was. [<em>Laughs</em>] I&#8217;d have to listen to it. I name my songs randomly and when someone relates to one, I kind of forget what songs they are. But that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been intentional. To me, this is probably the lightest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. But it doesn&#8217;t sound as good to me if it&#8217;s not raw and loud. Every time I do something, I try to at least push it in that regard. So most of the stuff is probably a bit rawer in that sense.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned song titles, and there&#8217;s some pretty funny ones on there, like ?Booger Dam? and ?Nougat Marathon?. Do you take pleasure in finding these colourful names?</strong><br/>
I guess so. It&#8217;s just a bit of fun for me, at the end of all the ?umming? and ?ahing? and being really serious about music. It doesn&#8217;t really matter too much, because it&#8217;s an instrumental record. I&#8217;m skeptical of overthought, processed kind of words. For ?Nougat Marathon?, I remember being in the back of a tour van with a shitload of nougat in front of me. And I was starving. <em>Maidenhair</em> is probably the only one that correlates back to [something bigger], ?cause I made the record in my old house. It was basically the tiny kitchen with my studio set up next door to it. I guess I tried to get a bit of that house involved. ?Missing LJA? is dedicated to Liam Andrews from My Disco, who I lived with for a really long time and is an old friend of mine. I lived with him until he left the country; he&#8217;s living over in London. The rest of it was pretty much just a stupid piss-take, I guess.</p>

<strong>But what does the word ?Maidenhair? mean?</strong><br/>
Just the actual maidenhair plant that I have hovering over me when I make music.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, I didn&#8217;t realise it was a plant.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Most of them look a bit different to each other, but they&#8217;re really sweet-looking plants. There are lush green ones that you can have indoors. They&#8217;re really nice. [<em>Laughs</em>] Google ?em. They&#8217;re good.</p>
<p><strong>You used to do production for <a href="/articles/4462757">Catcall</a>. Do you still want to do things like that?</strong><br/>
Yeah. Catcall, I heard some of the bedroom things she had been doing. And she was just a mutual friend of mine from Sydney that played in some punk bands that I played with as well. I&#8217;m always open to collaborating with people. Anyone, really. I find that if I rely upon myself too much, it gets really boring and I get stuck on things.</p>
<p><strong>I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a decision you made to focus more on your own thing.</strong><br/>
No, I have approached a lot of people about collaborating. I&#8217;m open to it, whether it be a rapper or a singer. Brain Children started singing because I couldn&#8217;t really find anybody else. It&#8217;s definitely not a choice. Most of the solo stuff ends up being like that because no one writes back to me. [<em>Laughs</em>] I&#8217;m confident enough to play music in front of people and play drums and be in a band and do all that stuff, but when it comes to a studio project I&#8217;ve got to come from a different angle [where] nobody really knows me and I don&#8217;t really know those people either. Because I haven&#8217;t spent my life establishing those connections. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a bit fun for me like that, like a brave new world to conquer.</p>
