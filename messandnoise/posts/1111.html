<h2>?Oblast?  </h2>
<p>Written right after the completion of <a href="http://amateurchildbirth.bandcamp.com/album/brighter-futures-dialysis">2010?s] <em>[Brighter Futures Dialysis</a></em>, this should&#8217;ve been included there but time didn&#8217;t permit. Instead it segues the two albums, so if you&#8217;re a masochist you could listen to them both in succession and everything will slot together like a really shithouse jigsaw puzzle. The original mythology involved a young turk living in the Brisbane suburb of Annerley, medicated for schizophrenia with delusions of governmental persecution &#8211; seeing unmarked helicopters in the skies around his home, assassins in his letterbox, the usual.</p>
<p>The coda ?no we are not accepting demos at this time? is pretty out of date; people probably don&#8217;t make demos anymore but I can easily imagine some military hardman in argyle fatigues at the Matador Records mailbox scrutinising everything that comes in, refusing to let the postman deliver unsolicited packages with a stern ?Nein demos! Nein musik!? and the world becomes a better place for them.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Pripyat?  </h2>
<p>I stayed up late one night reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat">Pripyat</a>, looking at photos of Pripyat, and decided to write a few songs about Pripyat and this was the first one, the rest of an album followed. I spent more time than it deserved ruminating over the correct spelling; Wikipedia editors have sweated tears and cried blood into their Talk pages over this very same dilemma. Western Australia has its own Pripyat at Wittenoom, but Midnight Oil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue<em>Sky</em>Mine">beat me to that</a>. </p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1854451905/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=2/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://disembraining.bandcamp.com/album/pripyat">PRIPYAT by Amateur Childbirth</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Heaven&#8217;s Gate?  </h2>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=AqSZhwu1Rwo">videos</a> of Marshall Applewhite, speaking directly to the camera with his great big face resembling some kind of strangulated pumpkin, and his dough eyes which blink about once every 10 minutes. These, plus the movie <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If<em>Footmen</em>Tire<em>You,</em>What<em>Will</em>Horses_Do%3F">If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?</a></em>, provided a launching pad of ludicrous, comically dangerous ideas on which to base more writing. The closing loop of this song is an attempt to recreate a cyclic, choral hypnosis heard on songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ZDgCnLcxdNU">?Lonely Hearts Get What They Deserve?</a> and countless others, but sang by a choir of cult devotees at an intervention.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1854451905/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=3/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://disembraining.bandcamp.com/album/pripyat">PRIPYAT by Amateur Childbirth</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Out?  </h2>
<p>The suburb of Chelmer was soaked by flooding in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=K1GzqxFeiNo">2011</a>, and there are still these artefacts around, empty and semi-destroyed buildings like the TAFE campus where the video for this song was filmed. The state government are trying to sell it but I think there&#8217;s legal tape because it basically sits in a stormwater funnel. A few years prior, a man was cut out and airlifted from a pylon in the Indooroopilly Bridge because he was morbidly obese and couldn&#8217;t use the stairs. In the 1996 Grafton flood, a youth became homeless when his house became an island by rising water. He stole a car to sleep in, only to lock his house keys inside it.</p>
<p>A song about evacuation, being forcibly removed from your comfort zone and being agoraphobic when the announcement came on April 27 to leave Chernobyl. This originally had two parts, a second song tacked on the end about Inuits bathing in urine. But we couldn&#8217;t get it to work; instrumentally it just sounded wrong. We ditched the drums, added all types of squawking synthesizers, a distorted bass and a slide guitar, but we were just adding clutter to hide the simple fact the song sucked. The decision was made to amputate, and I still have a soft spot for it so it&#8217;ll probably appear at some stage.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Decommissioned Antibiotics?  </h2>
<p>In an abandoned corner of a Soviet state, a recently elected government official who wanted to destroy the reputation of a previous official by dreaming up imaginary debts &#8211; convincing everyone it&#8217;s perfectly normal for their government to be run like a business and generate a profit/surplus &#8211; stumbles across a cache of unused medical supplies in an old warehouse. The box is radioactive and covered in asbestos dust, but is exported anyway and used to save wasted dollars. A panoramic shot of the titular abandoned township, recounting tales of domestic abuse and the pets who wandered back to reclaim it once the people had cleared out.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1854451905/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=5/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://disembraining.bandcamp.com/album/pripyat">PRIPYAT by Amateur Childbirth</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Raincoat?  </h2>
<p>A throwaway track about electroconvulsive therapy, about being held against your will in an institution, hiding medications under your mattress, about the physical abuse of health care workers, about fictionalised accounts of serious places, much like this song &#8211; all set to a couple of dumb chords on a guitar and organ.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1854451905/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=6/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://disembraining.bandcamp.com/album/pripyat">PRIPYAT by Amateur Childbirth</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Toothache of Poison Rain?  </h2>
<p>In its original form, played on my worst acoustic guitar and slowed right down, I wanted this to sound like Mad Nanna. Pretty sure I didn&#8217;t succeed, but I&#8217;d been listening to <em><a href="/releases/2001041">I Made Blood Better</a></em>, especially songs like ?Deck Song?, which has this rolling pulse through it. I wrote the riff off the cuff, featuring the same two chords used in almost all my songs, and it all came on pretty quickly which I was pretty happy about because it meant I finally had 11 complete songs, my personal goal for album length. Paul [Slater]?s drumming is at its most subdued, and he made this song into something collaborative and better than I originally imagined.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1854451905/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=7/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://disembraining.bandcamp.com/album/pripyat">PRIPYAT by Amateur Childbirth</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Menopause in Reverse?  </h2>
<p>This song relates what follows devastation and burning rubble, The End Times, a Book of Revelation scenario. In the opening of the film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A<em>Thief</em>in<em>the</em>Night_(film">A Thief in the Night</a>)</em>, there&#8217;s a really novice performance of Larry Norman&#8217;s ?I Wish We&#8217;d All Been Ready? by a youth church band. The entire thing is ominous, with the drummer banging out a funeral march with gong mallets, enough to make you believe the kids are celebrating the apocalypse. I wanted to capture that naive sense of evil. Josh [Watson] came upstairs and effortlessly struck out the violin parts in record time &#8211; he did it on the second take because he didn&#8217;t like the first attempt &#8211; before offering mixing advice and then disappearing downstairs again. My favourite moment during recording was [engineer] Joel [Stern]?s reaction to the line about anal irrigation being ?fucking ridiculous.?</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Post-War Homes?  </h2>
<p>Probably the most derivative, four-chord exercise on the whole album and one of my favourites. We coloured in the song with a Moog, in an attempt to give the bridge segments a suitable astral quality, a soundtrack to being airlifted from your human cocoons to hitch a ride in the bowels of a comet into the nethersphere. More Applewhite.</p>

<h2>?Forever the Collapsing Sky?  </h2>
<p>I really thought I was breaking new ground by writing a song on organ instead of guitar, and then when we went to record it, this old wood-panelled Casiotone which has been in my family since the ?80s suddenly went pop and a cloud of smoke flew out of it. It hasn&#8217;t worked since and it sits in the garage awaiting repair. Joel and I carried it like a corpse on a stretcher out to the back veranda because it filled his house with this carcinogenic, burning stench. We settled instead for this tiny Yamaha keyboard which has a lot of excellent, thin brass sounds but which buzzes constantly unless you push and hold the cable in while you play. Paul had a lot of difficulty hearing me whisper and strum without a pick as he drummed, which resulted in an unintentionally out-of-step drum track.</p>

<h2>?Beneath Bathory&#8217;s Thighs?  </h2>
<p>Originally a song with a longer, more pretentious title written for the first album, which never came out because it was three times faster than it appears here, and it came toward the end of those sessions when I was out of breath and enthusiasm. I slowed it right down, intending to turn it into a power ballad and adding piano before I realised I didn&#8217;t have access to one. Instead Joel added a fuzzy, billowing effect to the organ and I changed the words to invoke a scenario involving Countess Bathory being conquered by virgins and children.</p>
