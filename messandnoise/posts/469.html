                <h3>As The Annandale&#8217;s 10th birthday bash enters its final week, <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> talks to publican Dan Rule about its colourful history and the challenges faced as it enters its second decade.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3012315/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
While it&#8217;s been open since the ?30s, one can hardly begrudge The Annandale for celebrating its 10th birthday this month. By the late 1990s, the pub had succumbed to Sydney&#8217;s inner-city pokies rash, but has since been resurrected under the stewardship of brothers Matt and Dan Rule.</p>
<p>The pair brought live music back to The Dale in 2000, and while the experiment has largely worked &#8211; it&#8217;s outlasted several venues including the sadly defunct Hopetoun in Surry Hills &#8211; they&#8217;ve still encountered a few difficulties along the way. The pub&#8217;s location on the corner of a busy six-lane highway and a quiet residential street in Sydney&#8217;s inner-west has meant they&#8217;ve had to battle Leichhardt Municipal Council over noise compliance and late trading for the past eight years. The last roll of the dice was a development application for the expansion of its beer garden and restaurant, which council mercifully passed in April. Had it not been approved, The Annandale might not have survived in its current form, as Dan Rule told <em>M+N</em> in a candid, hour-long interview in late June.</p>
<p><strong>I guess the 10th Birthday Week is a bit of a misnomer, because the pub&#8217;s been going since the ?30s. Do you know much about its history?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s funny. Someone came in with an old photo recently and, of course, the pub looked exactly the same. It looked a bit better then, actually. [<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s a funny one. We tried to trace back the history. We&#8217;re on the corner of Parramatta Road and Nelson Street and it started down on Nelson Street &#8211; well, that&#8217;s what the original licence said anyway. There was an owner before us. I was speaking to Richard, the owner of the Bridge Hotel. He started 25 years ago and he said that The Annandale had just started doing live music before him &#8211; It&#8217;s got a long history.</p>
<p><strong>When did you get involved?</strong><br/>
We first got there in ?99, and we put live music back on in 2000. The guy before us, who had taken the music off, didn&#8217;t have much experience, so we were called in to help him run the venue by the main creditor at the time. He was going to sell it and we saw an opportunity. We started tinkering with live music a bit, and we saw that it had a place at The Annandale. We put in an offer to buy one half, and about a year-and-a-half later, in about 2001 or 2002, we bought the other half off him. We started the music back there in early 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have any booking experience?</strong><br/>
Nah, we came in as hotel managers &#8211; People thought we bought the hotel for the love of live music, but to be honest with you, it was an opportunity to get into a hotel. We&#8217;d been working in the hotel industry for 15-20 years between. We saw an opportunity to buy an inner-city hotel. The good thing about us was that we weren&#8217;t picky about the bands that we booked. We were putting on any type of music that we could because we need to get people into the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Was it a thriving venue in those early days?</strong><br/>
No. Live music&#8217;s tough. I&#8217;ve still got nine poker machines. Punters don&#8217;t play poker machines. I&#8217;ve got mates that own hotels and they take $40,000-$60,000 out of their machines a week. I don&#8217;t even take $500 out of my machines a week. For me to take $40,000 out of the bar, which I don&#8217;t do, I&#8217;d have to put 40 staff on. Live music&#8217;s a tough way to make a gig. We get a very small percentage on the door &#8211; You&#8217;re putting three hours of entertainment on a night, and if people don&#8217;t come for those three hours, you&#8217;re up shit creek.</p>
<p><strong>Was it a challenge turning things around when you took over?</strong><br/>
Yeah, but any gig is a challenge. You have to build up a reputation and a following. It&#8217;s still a challenge to this day now. I had probably one of my worst weeks ever last week. We had some great music on last week, and they just didn&#8217;t come. I had The Gin Club in town, I had The Break (the guys from Midnight Oil) playing on Sunday, I had Deep Sea Arcade, and it was one of my worst weeks ever. It&#8217;s still tough. Just because you have 10 sell-outs this week, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s gonna happen next week.</p>
<p><strong>Has it been getting worse over the years?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s tougher. There&#8217;s more competition &#8211; whether within the live music, or other scenes &#8211; You&#8217;ve got so many festivals, where you can see all the bands that play here in one day for $100. People like The Strokes aren&#8217;t going to play at my pub. Five-thousand people on a Wednesday, who want to see live music, will go and see The Strokes or The Pixies when the Splendour sideshow rolls through town. It&#8217;s tough in that sense, but you&#8217;ve got to keep battling away and hopefully get some good acts in. </p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s a bit hard to explain to neighbours how you&#8217;re keeping noise levels down when you&#8217;ve got a band climbing up a lighting pole on Parramatta Road  banging a drum.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a really interesting point. Has the proliferation of Australian festivals cannibalised the pubs?</strong><br/>
Definitely. There&#8217;s not doubt about it. In January, when you&#8217;re just starting to fire up, for a live music venue it&#8217;s a killer. The Big Day Out does two days in Sydney and I don&#8217;t get one of their sideshows. It&#8217;s not their fault, that&#8217;s just how it works. You take 100,000 people out of the mix in two nights in Sydney, plus all the sideshows &#8211; You&#8217;ve just got to come up with different ways [to make money], I guess. We want to develop the pub into something more like a Corner Hotel in Melbourne, where it&#8217;s not just reliant on live music, it&#8217;s more a destination pub where you can go for a drink and some good food, but downstairs you have a great bandroom. That&#8217;s what The Corner&#8217;s got, and that&#8217;s what we want to try and do too.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the status of the development application?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s been passed. That was passed about two months ago, so now we&#8217;re negotiating with the bank. It&#8217;s dependant on the bank now. It&#8217;s quite a big development &#8211; It&#8217;s exciting. It takes the pressure off live music &#8211; and to have a bigger stronger business around it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of live venues seem to be diversifying their businesses to stay afloat.</strong><br/>
Well, that&#8217;s it. People love going to see a pub gig, but it kills me when they get there for one hour and have one schooner. That&#8217;s just the culture. I&#8217;ve done everything to try and change it, but it&#8217;s very hard. And with the focus on alcohol-related violence, once someone has five or six drinks and the coppers walk in and say, ?Oh, you&#8217;re serving a drunk guy?, it makes it very hard. The guy might not actually be drunk, he might just be having a good time. You have to cater for all your markets, like you said.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/another-rock-hotel-faces-heartbreak/2009/10/08/1254701103676.html">article</a> in the <em>SMH</em> [in which Matt Rule was critical of Leichhardt Municipal Council] had anything to do with the development application being pushed through?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] It didn&#8217;t hurt! I don&#8217;t want to get council offside &#8211; I&#8217;ve finally got a Green mayor that wants to listen after spending 10 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars battling councils in the past. It [the article] certainly gave them a bit of a push, because unless that development was passed, The Annandale wasn&#8217;t going to survive in its current form.</p>
<p><strong>So you are making headway with council?</strong><br/>
Yeah. We have to stick to the rules. We thought we always had stuck to the rules, but there were one or two neighbours that thought otherwise, and that&#8217;s just how the law plays it. You have to prove you&#8217;re innocent, instead of being innocent until you&#8217;re proven guilty. It&#8217;s very very hard on hotels. You have one or two neighbours that put in unproven complaints and you have to prove that you haven&#8217;t done anything wrong. It can be very frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Has the pub&#8217;s location worked for or against you?</strong><br/>
Although we&#8217;re on Parramatta Road &#8211; a six-line highway, probably one of the busiest in Australia &#8211; we&#8217;re on a residential street also [Nelson Street]. People leaving a live venue, they don&#8217;t realise. They&#8217;ve had a good night, they&#8217;ve had their ears blasted. They go outside, they might&#8217;ve had a couple drinks, and they&#8217;re a bit loud. It makes it hard, but we&#8217;ve got to educate our crowd. We have a lot of security on, for a lot of money, who don&#8217;t do very much except tell people to keep quiet out the front. That&#8217;s the way the laws are made &#8211; Something like The Hopetoun, where you&#8217;d have a door person on, a lighting guy on, a sound guy on, a bar person on and security on, for 30 people, you don&#8217;t make that much on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Have you been facing the same sorts of licensing issues as the pubs down in Melbourne?</strong><br/>
Not so much. It depends on your council here. It makes it hard when pubs are allotted with known trouble spots that are basically nightclubs. When you put drugs, women and a lot of testosterone in the same room, there&#8217;s going to be trouble. It doesn&#8217;t happen as much with live music, because people are there to see the bands. When [live venues] have to follow the same rules as nightclubs, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right. And from what I read into it, that&#8217;s what happened with The Tote, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It&#8217;s very arbitrary. If you have live music you attract ?high risk? conditions including extra security.</strong><br/>
It doesn&#8217;t make it viable. We haven&#8217;t been put into that situation yet, but in saying that I have to have one security guard for every 100 people in the room. I have strict security requirements on my licence, which makes it hard, but that&#8217;s how the licence is.</p>
<p><strong>How late are you licensed too?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got a 1am licence. We had a 3am licence and they took it off us. We had to fight to get it to 1am in court. Again, that was a couple of residents complaining. Most of the time we never used the 3am licence, but sometimes you want to try and create something. But is it worth the $200,000 you have to fight it in court for? We couldn&#8217;t justify it.</p>
<p><strong>The saddest thing is that it&#8217;s been a pub on a relatively busy strip since the 1930s. I&#8217;m sure the neighbours didn&#8217;t move in before then.</strong><br/>
Yeah, people have been saying that us bringing back live music has caused trouble in the area, which is false &#8211; We have two bus stops here. We&#8217;ve got people coming in from town &#8211; who have had a skinful at work on a Friday night and they&#8217;re walking down the street with beer bottles. Sometimes you get blamed for all the rubbish and all the things on the street when it&#8217;s not even your rubbish. But that&#8217;s the beauty of owing an inner-city venue, I guess. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Have you noticed an increase in violent incidents?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve been at The Annandale for 10 years and we just don&#8217;t have violence here. It&#8217;s not a place that breeds it. We see people drunk and we try and cut them off early. A lot of people that go to gigs want to see the band. They don&#8217;t want to play up. As for other inner-city places, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve worked at a lot of pubs that have been tough. Unfortunately, [alcohol and violence] go hand in hand, but you have to control the situation. Some people can handle their drinks and some people can&#8217;t. With closed-circuit television everywhere, everything is picked up. We&#8217;ve had cameras put up two years ago. I couldn&#8217;t afford them, but the police made me put them in &#8211; I think since they&#8217;ve got rid of smoking [in pubs], there&#8217;s a really big push against the alcohol industry and alcohol-related violence. It&#8217;s just what the media is going to focus on until all hotels have lockouts until 12am.</p>
<p><strong>Has the <a href="/news/3783572">removal</a> of the POPE [Place of Public Entertainment] licence improved the situation at all?</strong><br/>
We didn&#8217;t really notice it. It&#8217;s an interesting one. For us, it didn&#8217;t really change that much, because we already had the Place of Public Entertainment licence. But you&#8217;ve seen a few small bars pop up in Sydney now, mainly trendy ones. I think maybe Raval is doing a bit more live music now, and there are maybe a couple more. They said that it would open the door for more piano bars with jazz musicians, things like that, but I haven&#8217;t seen it. But if people want to do live music, hopefully it&#8217;ll make it easier for them to get a licence.</p>
<p><strong>With The Hopetoun&#8217;s closure, has The Annandale become a focal point in Sydney?</strong><br/>
The [Oxford] Art Factory is going really strong. It&#8217;s on Oxford Street, they&#8217;ve got a captive audience there. You&#8217;ve still got Spectrum as well. You&#8217;ve got The Metro and The Enmore, which are great venues, and little guys like The Excelsior. But I suppose we&#8217;re one of the more well-known venues in Sydney &#8211; One of the hardest things for me is that if I ever sold The Annandale, I could never own it again. You&#8217;ve only got one crack at this. If I sold it, I could never own such an iconic hotel again &#8211; there&#8217;s only one Annandale in Sydney.</p>
<p><strong>You could always buy The Hoey.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] I&#8217;d love to see The Hoey up and going again. It was one of my favourite little venues. It was like a twin to us, and I was friends with all the staff from there. It was a real shame that it closed down. It&#8217;s very hard for bands coming from Melbourne and Brisbane. It must be very frustrating. We used to live above The Annandale &#8211; we moved out about three years ago because my son was in school &#8211; and you&#8217;d see how hard it was for bands. The Hoey was the perfect stepping stone. Bands from Melbourne would come up and get a buzz about them by playing in The Hoey. Sometimes you could look at what was happening at The Hoey three months before and I could just book it at The Annandale three months after. I haven&#8217;t really got that now. There&#8217;s no really great 200-capacity venue in Sydney. It&#8217;s a very sad situation.</p>
<p><strong>Have you absorbed some of The Hoey&#8217;s business?</strong><br/>
No, I don&#8217;t think so. We do music Wednesdays to Sundays. They&#8217;re just hard nights, mainly in the winter and on Wednesdays and Thursdays. People in Sydney have just got to get off their arses, or maybe Sydney just has to become cheaper to live in &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what the answer is after 10 years &#8211; But I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s really filled the void that The Hoey&#8217;s left.</p>
<p><strong>I have to ask why people in Sydney haven&#8217;t been more vocal about its closure. We saw people take to the streets in Melbourne when The Tote shut down.</strong><br/>
It was a different situation. There was more to the story, unfortunately. If there was a story to be had about The Hoey and it was closed down for those reasons, you would&#8217;ve seen a lot more go on. If The Annandale were to close down due to silly council regulations, you&#8217;d see people up in arms. But it didn&#8217;t happen like it did with The Tote. It really didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps you would&#8217;ve seen people out in the street if your development application wasn&#8217;t approved and it led to the pub&#8217;s demise?</strong><br/>
But all that would&#8217;ve happened because there&#8217;s not enough people going to see live music, and that&#8217;s the whole thing &#8211; The reason the development is being done is because you have to be a much more rounded hotel or people have to go to gigs every night of the week, come down and have a fed, and support the hotel more. That&#8217;s just a matter of me being a better businessman.</p>
<p><strong>Will the redevelopment increase capacity?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;ll make the restaurant larger. It&#8217;s just like how people go to The Corner not just to see bands &#8211; Basically you&#8217;re a rented space, and if you&#8217;re only rented three a night, you just can&#8217;t pay your rate. You just have to become more multifunctional &#8211; I&#8217;d love to be able to say that the reason the hotel sometimes doesn&#8217;t work was because of council &#8211; and that was the case a few years ago when we fought them in court &#8211; but we just have to keep selling out, putting on good bands and do this development. I&#8217;ve got a 16-year-old son that I&#8217;d love to pass it on to, because I want to keep going down there and seeing bands.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the redevelopment.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;ll be a wraparound beer garden. We have a small, 70-80 feet beer garden out the back. It&#8217;ll be expanded to a 200-person beer garden. The main room where the music on will stay pretty much the same &#8211; The pub will hopefully become a bit more local friendly, not just driven by the three nights that we have live music.</p>
<p><strong>How heavy are you relying on this redevelopment?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s the evolution of our business. We&#8217;ve been working on this for the past four or five years. That&#8217;s always been our dream: to expand it and get it to a model where it&#8217;s running really efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Are you amazed at how iconic the pub&#8217;s become in just 10 years?</strong><br/>
Like you said, the music was here before us, but I&#8217;m very proud of what we&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s the thing about The Annandale, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just me and Matt. All the artists are great, It all comes together really well: the stage is the right height and there&#8217;s no sightline in the room. It&#8217;s iconic, but I think there&#8217;s a lot of good people in the music industry that tell a lot of good stories.</p>

<strong>Any shows that have stuck out over the years?</strong><br/>
Bonnie Prince Billie was an amazing show. The Mark of Cain, when John Stanier was playing with them &#8211; I&#8217;ve really enjoyed Eddy Current&#8217;s last few shows here. They&#8217;re just really nice guys and I look forward to seeing them here again &#8211; Hot Snakes, Silversun Pickups, Dandy Warhols, Gerling, seeing The Drones coming through, starting with a handful of people and selling out two nights in a row. Seeing those really good shows really reinforces why you do it. The bad ones make you a bit sad, but it&#8217;s all part of the roundabout I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of bad shows, were you there for that infamous Vines performance [frontman Craig Nicholls trashed the stage and insulted the audience at a Triple M-sponsored gig]?</strong><br/>
I was actually &#8211; It was certainly a rollercoaster of a night. It was one of the real punk moments of my 10 years here, because you just didn&#8217;t know what Craig was going to do. It&#8217;s like when you watch Eddy Current, you just don&#8217;t know what Brendan&#8217;s going to do. There&#8217;s a lot of footage on that, and we&#8217;ve re-watched it, and The Vines actually played brilliantly that night &#8211; I suppose that was an iconic moment for the pub, but there have been so many great shows. Rocket from the Crypt and International Noise Conspiracy were other good ones.</p>
<p><strong>Didn&#8217;t [Israeli punk band] Monotonix recently cause a few headaches as well?</strong><br/>
My brother was at that one. [<em>Laughs*] It caused a bit of drama, but I think we got away with it. The band were out there on Parramatta Road playing their instruments. It&#8217;s a bit hard to explain to neighbours how you&#8217;re keeping noise levels down when you&#8217;ve got a band climbing up a lighting pole on Parramatta Road banging a drum. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Have you had a hand in picking the bands for the birthday shows?</strong><br/>
We put in our input. There were a lot of people that couldn&#8217;t do it because of touring schedules or putting out records &#8211; Jimmy Barnes, since he got up on the stage with Dallas Crane and did a launch here about five years ago, has always been one of our biggest supporters. It&#8217;s very very nice that he&#8217;s coming down to play: he&#8217;s an icon of Australian music. But I can&#8217;t complain about anyone on the bill. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it &#8211; my liver isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Who couldn&#8217;t you get?</strong><br/>
We asked Eddy Current, but they were overseas. You Am I were another one, but they&#8217;re working on another album. Magic Dirt too, but they have their issues, obviously. There&#8217;s so much talent out there that we could&#8217;ve done it over a couple months.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a shame about You Am I because they&#8217;re almost synonymous with the pub.</strong><br/>
Well, You Am I basically closed The Annandale on its last show [in 1999] and Tim said he&#8217;d never walk back into the hotel with its current owners. They came back and played about five years later. We did three nights with them in November last year, and I have no doubt they&#8217;ll come back and play. That&#8217;s who we had in mind to headline, but we had some other good headliners anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What do you envision for the next 10 years?</strong><br/>
I really want to get this development through so we can be financially secure &#8211; My plan is to get the building moving as quickly as possible; really securing it and tying it down. I&#8217;d just love to keep it going. There&#8217;s not too much I&#8217;d change about the bandroom. I don&#8217;t want to knock it down and make a 1000-seat room or anything. I want to keep it at a nice little capacity. If I can just secure it financially for the next 10 years, so we&#8217;re in a position to hand it on to some people who share our outlook on live music, I&#8217;d be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Have you enjoyed watching it on [ABC2 series] <em>I Rock</em> over the past few weeks?</strong><br/>
I haven&#8217;t watched much of it, because Monday night is a family night, and I haven&#8217;t got digital TV. That&#8217;s how backward I am. [<em>Laughs</em>] I have watched a couple episodes and it&#8217;s really funny seeing the old girl up on camera all the time.</p>
