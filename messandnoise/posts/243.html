                <h3>With PBS? annual Radio Festival in full swing, broadcast manager Gary Seven talks to &#8216;M+N&#8217; about the station&#8217;s financial position, the difficulty of fundraising in tough economic times and why it&#8217;s more important than ever to support community radio.

<strong>What&#8217;s planned for the Radio Festival?</strong><br/>
This year, the theme for Radio Festival is ?30 Years On &#8211; More Important Than Ever?, so it&#8217;s a celebration of 30 years of great music and 30 years of independent radio. We have over $50,000 in prizes to give away and every member who signs up gets a free CD, not to mention great music on PBS all year round.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the thinking behind the ?More Important Than Ever? tagline?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really amazing that a station like PBS that plays so many different kinds of music (blues, jazz, world, folk, hip-hop, metal, soul, punk, indie, reggae, electronic, country, Aussie, just to name a few) has been going for 30 years. It&#8217;s not just a radio station playing music, but also part of the cultural fabric of Melbourne as it keep us informed on upcoming live music, cultural events. Our regular nights, such as Soul a Go Go, Riff Raff and Square Deal, serve to connect people through music.</p>
<p><strong>You worked at Triple R for years before taking the position at PBS. Is there a difference in outlook/culture between the two stations?</strong><br/>
I think there are more similarities between PBS and RRR than differences. Both stations are independent (owned by the community, members and subscribers) and both stations have very passionate and informed announcers. Perhaps the only difference is that PBS plays more music as it is purely a music-based station.</p>
<p><strong>Is PBS experiencing the same financial problems as your peers at FBi?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not sure what happened at FBi Radio in Sydney but I heard they might be closing their doors which is a real shame for Sydney listeners.</p>
<p>There is isn&#8217;t a lot of money in the community radio sector as we don&#8217;t use ?big business?-type sponsors and most stations don&#8217;t receive any government funding, so you need very careful planning, as does any business. PBS spends a lot of time making sure that we are always planning ahead as much as we can.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on FBi&#8217;s ?<a href="http://www.messandnoise.com/news/3606515">Ask Richard</a>? campaign? Would PBS ever have to resort to something like this?</strong><br/>
I haven&#8217;t seen that campaign. So, sorry, don&#8217;t know about that.</p>
<p><strong>Is PBS in a healthy financial position?</strong><br/>
A lot of businesses are struggling across may industries at the moment but I think things are going along as well as can be expected during the crazy global financial meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>How important is an event like Radio Festival to PBS? coffers? And where does the money go?</strong><br/>
Our ongoing costs are covered by fundraising events like the Radio Festival which is on now. The money raised simply goes to cover ongoing costs: simple things such as paper, pens, phone, power etc. So it&#8217;s a very important time of the year for PBS.</p>
<p><strong>In light of the current economic crisis, is it becoming increasingly difficult to fundraise?</strong><br/>
We are always amazed at the passion and generosity of our listener/members at PBS who subscribe to the station and help keep us on air. Personally, I think PBS listeners love their music and are kind enough to support a station that plays the music they love ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>For those not familiar with the ins and outs of community radio, what does the broadcast manager do?</strong><br/>
The broadcast manager helps to manage the on-air part of PBS. So looking after all of the shows that are on air at present and looking for the great shows of the future. It&#8217;s sometimes challenging, but tonnes of fun at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any type of music you won&#8217;t play at PBS?</strong><br/>
We look to support ?under-represented? music, so Top 40-type stuff is not our bag.</p>
<p><strong>Is local content still a priority? And is there a minimum percentage you adhere to?</strong><br/>
Of course local music is a priority. PBS is one of the last stations where you can drop off a demo and perhaps end up on air or with an interview without a lot of red tape. Many of our announcers are at local gigs and shows across a range of genres (jazz, indie, metal, electronic, etc.), so they are always on the lookout for new local music.</p>
<p><strong>With increased competition from podcasts and digital radio, is the future of community radio safe?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not sure why there is a perception that radio will die out when it all becomes digital. I was reading that many experts predicted that TV would kill off radio in the ?50s and they were way off the mark as we know. Digital radio will make it easier for people all over the globe to listen to PBS &#8211; and that has to be a positive.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, give us a pitch: why should we support Radio Fest?</strong><br/>
If you like to support original and exciting local music and music from all over the world &#8211; free of big business and corporate advertising &#8211; then you should support PBS. Cheesy as it may sound, PBS is run by the people, for the people and owned by the community, so it&#8217;s your station. Get on board.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>PBS? Radio Festival runs from May 18-31.</p>
