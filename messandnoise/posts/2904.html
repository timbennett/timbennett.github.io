                <h3>With their second album, Brisbane band Hits pretty much save rock ?n? roll, writes <strong>PATRICK EMERY</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3038849/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
?Don&#8217;t you think that there&#8217;s hardly new music that really <em>hits</em> you these days like it once did?? Delivered by a friend who&#8217;d borne passionate witness to some of the best Australian rock ?n? roll bands from the ?80s onwards, it was a rhetorical observation on the quality of the latest bands to appear on the local music scene &#8211; hiding behind the flimsy facade of sincere inquiry.</p>
<p>The terseness of my response probably took him by surprise: like the whimsical commentary of a stuffy colonialist observing the exotic customs of the indigenous population, such utterances are a reflection of the observer&#8217;s psychological and sociological assumptions, rather than any robust objective assessment. ?Nothing will ever have the same impact it did when you were 18, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t any good.?</p>
<p>A few years later I was in the company of a punk rocker whose many years of service against the jive put him on the very non-punk side of 50. ?Do you feel like you&#8217;re 50?? asked someone less than half his age. The response came with a mischievous grin. ?It depends on the context,? he replied. ?If I don&#8217;t want to feel I&#8217;m over 50, why should I??</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Hits. The day before last year&#8217;s <a href="/news/4586124">Powder Monkeys tribute show</a> I received a message on my mobile from someone whose name I knew, but I&#8217;d never met. ?Make sure you see Hits tomorrow night &#8211; you&#8217;ll absolutely love them!? &#8211; or words to that effect. I knew the name &#8211; a few weeks later I discovered Hits? <a href="/releases/2000636">first album</a> buried in my record collection, its relative anonymity violently at odds with the quality of the album &#8211; yet hadn&#8217;t afforded it much attention. Upon arriving at The Tote early that evening, the first three people I encountered conveyed the same emphatic message: ?Make sure you see Hits. You don&#8217;t want to miss them tonight.?  </p>
<blockquote><p>?We watched Hits deliver a set that was everything and more than had been foreshadowed.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ensconced at the rear of Cobra we watched Hits deliver a set that, fortunately, was everything and more than had been foreshadowed. Observed through the sepia-toned glasses of old rock ?n? roll fartdom, Hits was just another rock band doing what rock ?n? roll bands have been doing. But if you couldn&#8217;t see just how good Hits were that night &#8211; and, presumably, just about every other night they play (you can&#8217;t have the highs without the odd low) &#8211; you&#8217;re waving the white flag and surrendering to the insipid beige-clad forces of gratuitous nostalgia.  </p>
<p>Hits are from Brisbane, if that makes any difference &#8211; which it probably does, but maybe not as much as it once did. <em>Hikikomori</em> is Hits? second album, delivered against a backdrop of parochial and extra-territorial expectation. And, by jeezus, it delivers.</p>
<p>The opening song, ?Bullet Train?, is the shot across the bows: it&#8217;s a pub-rock track like so many before it, and presumably so many after it. It&#8217;s got the swagger of Rose Tattoo at the Bondi Lifesaver in 1978, the booze-fuelled bravado of Beasts of Bourbon at the Phoenician Club in 1991 and the cocksure arrogance of the Powder Monkeys at the Punters Club in 1994. When the religious right rallies against the salacious evil of rock ?n? roll, this is what they&#8217;re talking about.  </p>
<p>?Jeezus F Christ? is the speed rock follow-up: with Rob Younger in the producer&#8217;s chair, the New Christs comparisons are obvious and transcend the blasphemous titular aspect. Lead singer Dick Richards sings like a man condemned, but unable to concede the integrity of his romantic cause, whatever its dangerous consequences. And if that&#8217;s not the most brutal interplay of lead and grinding rhythm in recent memory (courtesy of Tamara Dawn Bell and Stacey Coleman), then who really gives a fuck what is?</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/p621iDD7UEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>?Bitter and Twisted? is the dirty blues track to take the edge off. It&#8217;s the morning after the night before, the sun is coming up and someone&#8217;s thrown <em>Funhouse</em> on the turntable to usher in another day. Then it&#8217;s a hop and a skip into hitherto unknown pop territory: ?The Church Song? is where The Hitmen tried to take the Radio Birdman legacy until events conspired against their quest.</p>
<p>?Disappointed? is the ballad of the wretched, the marginalised and the completely and utterly fucked up. You&#8217;re in the gutter staring into the darkness of the human existence trying to ascertain meaning in a society that celebrates superficiality over substance. You can hear the spirit of X in there and for a moment &#8211; six minutes, in fact &#8211; you&#8217;re up against the wall with every other one-percenter fighting against the strictures of the dominant culture.</p>
<p>?G-Banger? is sex on a rock ?n? roll stick. Chunky guitar riffs, loosely formed consonants and the rhythmic potency of the suburban rock scene of yore. You&#8217;re young, tough and apparently bulletproof, and fuck everyone else &#8211; literally, figuratively and metaphorically.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Maybe it&#8217;s just a brutal attack on the senses.?</p></blockquote>
<p>?Up in the Air? lives and breathes the ?50s rock ?n? roll tradition that lies just beneath the colour and glamour of the New York Dolls. ?Loose Cannon? opens with a ceremonial &#8211; if gratuitous &#8211; ?fuck? and it&#8217;s a short step into Celibate Rifles territory with wild vengeance. ?Loose cannons goes off? is the indulgent vocal refrain: the metaphor is barely subtle, and a reminder of the volatility upon the ideal rock ?n? roll type is built.</p>
<p>?Shadowplay? is linear rock, writ large, loud and dangerous: you could take the song apart into its constituent parts and find a basic formula and still never quite understand how it all hangs together in such a bruising whole. But do you really need to understand when it&#8217;s all there to hear and sonically imbibe?</p>
<p>?Drink Too Much? might be a confession conveyed in the third person; or maybe it&#8217;s a well-considered series of accusations designed to reduce the recipient to a state of psychological jelly. Or maybe it&#8217;s just a brutal attack on the senses when Tamara Bell whips out a Mick Taylor guitar solo and plays havoc with your already battered senses.</p>
<blockquote><p>?If anyone claims rock ?n? roll has done its dash, they haven&#8217;t heard Hits.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The album concludes with ?Lost in the Somme?. When the Anzac celebrations get into full swing next year we&#8217;ll be bombarded with hagiographic tales of Aussie endeavour, bravery and rugged fortitude on the beaches of Gallipoli: odds are that we won&#8217;t hear the more statistically more disturbing tales of human slaughter in northern France in the succeeding years of the Great War, when tens of thousands of Australian soldiers died in some of modern history&#8217;s most futile and tragic battles. Dick Richards? great-grandfather died in the Somme; it&#8217;s not too much of a stretch of the imagination to align the thunderous attack of this track with the relentless artillery bombardment of the battles of Pozieres and Fromelles.</p>
<p>There have been other rock ?n? roll records as good as <em>Hikikomori</em>, and there will be other albums in the future that are just as good, and maybe, just maybe, even better. But if anyone ever claims that rock ?n? roll has done its dash, that nothing will ever be genuinely exciting again, they haven&#8217;t heard Hits. This is a band &#8211; and an album &#8211; for the ages.</p>
