?Can I ask you a question??  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m standing next to the ?Strongbow Boat?, (an actual boat, painted in Strongbow colours. A savvy marketing ploy to encourage Gen Y kids to keep buying it. Did you know it&#8217;s the fastest selling drink in the CUB roster? Apparently Gen Y kids are too young to associate Strongbow with being the drink of middle-aged women at Slapz nightclub.)  </p>
<p>?Sure.? I say, not wanting to be asked a question.  </p>
<p>?I just want to clear this up, my friends and I have been arguing about it and I thought it&#8217;d be best to hear it straight from you.?<br/>
Oh boy.  </p>
<p>?Are you making fun of hipsters in an ironic way by being a musician who writes songs about them or are you actually more concerned with writing from your own perspective as you&#8217;re more of a hipster yourself??  </p>
<p>Ash Grunwald isn&#8217;t getting asked things like this. The toughest questions he faced backstage was, ?When are you touring next?? and ?Can I touch your dreads?? (From me.) </p>
<p>After 10 minutes of defending myself in an articulate monotone, I could see that this guy was trying to be a fan, in the most complicated, backhanded Australian indie snob way possible.<br/>
?Do you think I annoy people because I don&#8217;t put myself in one category and they can&#8217;t quite tell what I&#8217;m doing?? I ask, seriously.<br/>
?Yeah I do,? he says.<br/>
?Good,? I reply. Sipping my cold bottle of fizzy moselle blended with dingo&#8217;s lipstick with an after kick of boob sweat.</p>
<p>My eyes automatically land on ?19-year-old girl in impossibly tiny shorts #843? and I slam my hormones into reverse, taking several other emotions with them. The distant sounds of Paul Kelly blend with the inane three chord rock across from me creating the equivalent of trying to read <em>Lolita* while listening to an audio book of *Zoo</em> magazine. God I hate festivals.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>I&#8217;m at the Virgin Blue gate with Public Enemy. Flava Flav has his clock on. The band are huddled around Boost trying to decide which drink they want. </p>
<p>?I want something with Mango,? says Chuck D in the most serious voice you can imagine. Our entirely separate life paths, emanating from the cultural poles of New York and Burnie, cross briefly as I walk up the aisle to take my seat. Chuck D is coming the other way. The only explanation for this is he hasn&#8217;t heeded the, ?Rows 13 And Beyond It&#8217;s Time To Split? sign. Chuck D doesn&#8217;t take orders from anyone. The guy&#8217;ll get on the plane by crawling up the escape slide if he feels like it. Adorned head to toe in his own merchandise, he eyes me off. I stop and crab walk myself into a seat. The blackest man alive and the whitest man alive having a wordless face off in the generic corridor of the bourgeois. There&#8217;s only one thing to say when you&#8217;re face to face with an American icon you&#8217;ve followed very lightly over the years. Nothing.</p>
<p>On stage, Public Enemy are much funnier than anything I&#8217;ve come up with.<br/>
?TASMANIAAAA!? said in a low, ominous voice.<br/>
?Are you ready for public ENEMEEEEE.?<br/>
Cheer.<br/>
?Then make some god-damn fucking NOISE.?<br/>
Louder cheer.<br/>
And so forth. This is all well and good until 30 minutes later a track is introduced with.<br/>
?C&#8217;MONNN Are you ready for public ENEMEEEEE????<br/>
Less cheer. I think we&#8217;ve established that Public Enemy are performing and we are all conscious. </p>
<p>The set of thin ?n? nasty ?90s beats are peppered with violent self-promotion. ?Public Enemy Number One? mashes with frequent plugs for Chuck D&#8217;s twitter and at one stage I spy Professor X waving around his own can of street fragrance. Nothing could stop the Flava train who was reminding me of Tracy Jordan.</p>
<p>?On behalf of myself Flava Flav?? (Mental note &#8211; start referring to self in third person. Beddy Phil wants a banana. Beddy Phil doesn&#8217;t feel like washing up) Chuck D, Professor Griff, Terminator X we want to thank you Tasmania for supporting us over the years, without you there would be no Public Enemy.? If the two blokes next to me with singlets, beer guts and kitchen wall clocks hanging round their necks were anything to go by, Flav was right.<br/>
?And second of all, I want to thank you for supporting me in my second job, television. You&#8217;ve helped make Flava Flav the number one reality TV star in the past decade.?<br/>
Less cheer.<br/>
Apparently Public Enemy have said in press releases they don&#8217;t endorse <em>Flavor of Love</em>, a show where he searches for a wife and has a wedding in a big church full of alter boiiiiiiiiiiiiii&#8217;s.<br/>
It&#8217;s too good.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>Meanwhile, back at Woodford, I&#8217;m watching a surly UK clown balance a world globe on his head while standing one legged on a tightrope as a metaphor for the amount spent on arms globally, and the 300,000 killed annually by small arms fire. It&#8217;s dense. The juggling of clowning and politics is the most impressive part of the act. We&#8217;re trying to appreciate his cause, but it&#8217;s heavy-handed politics delivered to an un-clown-savvy bunch with an underlying tone of bitterness and lack of regard for the audience. There&#8217;s a volunteer with a big gut on stage dinging a bell every minute (to represent casualties) and another massive dude holding a bubble blowing gun (to represent bubbles). It&#8217;s sweaty and tired and uncomfortable. The clown is MC-ing before me later in the evening, and pulls out a trick involving some frozen peas in a jar. He puts the jar in a billiards triangle, ties rope around it and slings it round his head until the peas mash together and the glass fills with water.</p>
<p>?World peas, we all want it.? He says, laughing savagely into the mic and outstaying his welcome. Peas/peace gag &#8211; it&#8217;s all pretty harmless, until the jar flies off into the audience.<br/>
?That hasn&#8217;t happened in 10 years,? he says wearily, wandering into the crowd to retrieve the pieces. I find him backstage after.<br/>
?Hey, I really liked your set before.?<br/>
I am being genuine, I appreciated the combination of depressing statistics and clown tricks, even if it didn&#8217;t really work. He says nothing. His dark, beady eyes shine through gaudy makeup. He smiles at me, precisely, in the most chilling manner. It is readable through the makeup, and at first seems genuine and friendly, but at the heart of the smile, too angular and practiced, are a pair of screaming eyes, full of tremendous darkness. It is a look that says, ?Go. All is broken. A shadow approaches.?</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>It&#8217;s 12am and I&#8217;ve been lying paralysed on a damp camp bed for three hours, not sleeping. The bed is on a lean, so that the bedding is all bunched up and soggy near my feet. My girl snoozes away on the camp bed next to me. My head is a fetid porridge of thoughts and the sticky nebulous of noise pollution coming from two separate stages. Music has dissolved in the rain, reduced to clumps of snare and globs of bass. Mushy vocals soar and splatter into the trees, dripping down like echo confetti. This is audio torture. I am being held captive in my own situation, out of obligation. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3018873/427x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I have to get up at 4am to catch a 7am flight to make a 12pm car ride to a 3pm performance. As the triple decker ambience sandwich squelches through my ears I cop a fourth layer of mouldy nonsense. A gaggle of teens are yelling the national anthem ironically. I break. I am a seething whirlwind of arms and legs and glasses, trying to find my clothes and put them on in the dark along with my wallet and keys. Yes, tent keys, by that I mean my Blundstones, which I&#8217;m going to use to kick the thing in when I come back sozzled on chai whiskey and liquorice cigs. I&#8217;ve been in odd situations, but there&#8217;s nothing like trying to clomp off while remaining careful not to slip on the liquid mud track, assessing the risk of ones heart combusting with rage should a soggy bottom be added to the cocktail of calamity.</p>
<p>I pound through the labyrinth of tent ropes, vans, umbrellas and torches to the glorious amphitheatre stage where You Am I are playing. Even though they&#8217;ve been responsible for the swirling sound menagerie plaguing my brain for the last couple of hours, I&#8217;m grateful it&#8217;s them. There is something comforting about their presence, like an old friend. In this era of marketing conscious, Pro Tools polished indie acts, You Am I are still a raw drop of hot blood in the Australian rock melting pot. Tim is onstage wearing a watermelon red velvet jacket, white singlet and black jeans. Note to self: Dress like Tim Rogers. Fashion appreciation is my highest badge of honour, and Tim makes a very short list, along with Jarvis Cocker. Two men who resemble cool art teachers and dress like timelessly stylish vagabonds. I&#8217;m worried about Tim&#8217;s voice. It sounds a little thin, and I hope he hasn&#8217;t blown it out. He calls the audience ?beautiful fuckers? and advises the guys not to kiss the girls until they say ?yes? five times. I think the last song is called ?Starting Over?, which I&#8217;ve never heard, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>Spending time at music festivals reminds me how hard it is to write a good song. I&#8217;m a fiercely discerning critic, and my displeasure with most new music revolves around the same beef. Not enough hooks! Listen to Radiohead, The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Ariel Pink&#8217;s new album. Daft Punk. Yeah? Listen to You Am I&#8217;s ?Damage? and then listen to electro whimsy/mopey indie rock stuff. Difference? Those songs go on for five minutes and the chorus hardly makes any impact, the lyrics are hard to decipher and they seem to be using the same four chords as the song before. Hey music, GET INTERESTING! You are entertainment and we want to be entertained. No wonder alcohol is your main serving suggestion.</p>
<p>The last song goes for 10 minutes and ends with Tim screaming ?just start over again?. It&#8217;s epic. It&#8217;s one of those ?let&#8217;s play a song for 10 minutes that at first you think goes for too long and then you tune out and forget it&#8217;s even playing and then you tune back in and then it peaks and you realise that it&#8217;s actually really dramatic and moving and awesome.? I wonder if it&#8217;s about You Am I starting over again after their Falls Festival meltdown, which I witnessed in 2006. Tim prefaced the song with, ?You might be muddy and hot and saturated, but you&#8217;ve just got to ring out your Kings of Leon T-shirts and get back out there.? We both have Kings of Leon references. I am cheered. I trudge off to a bar to sit by myself and scowl and drink one Kilkenny beer.  </p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be seven dollars? says the girl.<br/>
I give her the money.<br/>
&#8220;Oh I can&#8217;t handle money, you&#8217;ll have to buy a drink token first.?<br/>
&#8220;Where do I get them?? I ask.<br/>
&#8220;Over there.? She says, pointing to the girl next to her.<br/>
I walk over to the girl.<br/>
&#8220;Can I have one seven dollar token.?<br/>
&#8220;That&#8217;ll be seven dollars.?<br/>
I give her seven dollars, and am handed a token. I step over to the first girl and give her the token. She gives me the drink. I sit down at a table. Soon, a young girl comes up.<br/>
&#8220;Excuse me, my cousin wants to know if you&#8217;re The Bedroom Philosopher.?<br/>
&#8220;No, I get that a lot.?<br/>
&#8220;Oh.?<br/>
&#8220;Who is he?? This is a trick I sometimes use to conduct real-time, anonymous market research on how I&#8217;m faring with the kids.<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.?<br/>
&#8220;Is he any good??<br/>
&#8220;Nah.?<br/>
&#8220;Right.?<br/>
(Did she really just say that?)<br/>
&#8220;What kind of stuff does he play??<br/>
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not sure. I haven&#8217;t heard him actually.?<br/>
Huh? I&#8217;m very tired.<br/>
This interview is over.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>It&#8217;s the final day of my week long campaign and I&#8217;m snorkelling. I&#8217;ve managed to gad off with a pal who lives in nearby Gracetown. I&#8217;m face down, submerged in beautiful cool waters, breathing underwater and casually trawling my gaze over blurry seaweed. A swim in the ocean is the reset button for the soul. After that it&#8217;s the Margaret River ice creamery, chocolate factory, and a game of ?Hey Cow!? The game is played by yelling ?Hey Cow!? out the window and seeing how many cows turn to look at you. You get a point for each cow. I get four.</p>
<p>Back at the festival the comedians are bundled into a van and taken to the airport for an 11pm Qantas red eye flight back home. I&#8217;m much more relaxed after my swim and enjoy being part of a joke fiesta. I accidentally start a Flava Flav game.</p>
<p>?What does Flava Flav have in his coffee? Soyyyyyyyyy<br/>
?What&#8217;s Flava Flav&#8217;s favourite ice cream? Boyyyyyyysenberry  </p>
<p>?What&#8217;s Flava Flav&#8217;s favourite town? Woyyyyyy Woyyyyyyyy. And so on. You must feel for the Marina &amp; The Diamonds sound guy who&#8217;s in the van with us for three hours. We are a panel show he can&#8217;t turn off. </p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m killing my Marion Bay Falls gig. The audience are loving it. Someone even yells out, ?We love you Beddy Phil.? (My girl later reveals it was her).?</p></blockquote>
<p>At the airport Sam Simmons gets a tip off that the Virgin terminal has better food. This means Red Rooster. There&#8217;s nothing more glamorous than four men picking at chicken while a cleaner vacuums behind them.<br/>
?I call this putting things in the bin awkwardly,? says Sam, wandering off. Just as he reaches the bins he trips dramatically and bashes himself into tables and chairs. The surly blokes next to the bin stare at him. We are in fits. He returns with a Lime Big M.</p>
<p>?The taste of my childhood. Have the rest I only wanted a sip.? The bright green box sits exotically in the middle of our table. It glows magically against the drab greys and off-whites of the airport. (Whimsical Wes Anderson scene number two.) I take a sip. It tastes like spearmint choc-wedges, mown grass, trampolines, football on the radio, sunshine and comfort.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m killing my Marion Bay Falls gig. The audience are loving it. Someone even yells out, ?We love you Beddy Phil.? (My girl later reveals it was her).  </p>
<p>Ah, what a noble and harebrained art this is. This conduction of mirth. Powered by the scorching and swollen gland of stress, hope and expectation, quietly jammed somewhere between the heart and lungs, oozing a bright, thick serum that spikes the bloodstream, drawing past memories and present spirit together like a rampant magnet &#8211; binding intellect, hurt and frivolity to form the tantalising, ephemeral chemical of wit.</p>
<p>I begin the two note riff to ?Northcote?. Some of the crowd cheer.<br/>
?How many indie kids does it take to change a lightbulb? One, but I liked the old lightbulb better.?<br/>
Healthy laughter.<br/>
?Keeping lightbulb jokes relevant since 1980,? I adlib, before launching into the familiar, ?Hello, oh hey, Joel?, that I&#8217;m not as sick of playing as I was with, ?I&#8217;m so post modern.? The rest of the crowd realise what&#8217;s on the white boy jukebox and start clapping. I can hear a girl up the front speaking along to the lyrics, which almost puts me off. ?That girl speaking along is making my schizophrenia flare up,? I add. Tiny planets align. I get to the chorus and a thousand odd kids sing along. ?Ffffffflick through indie.? This is the first time any crowd has sung along with one of my choruses before. This is a good way to spend the last day of 2010. My happiness is a comet that shines so brightly, the light creeps through the horizons of my mind, touching the nearby days of my past and future, dissolving bleary pictures into an oily canvas that paints streaks of yellow and white along my synaesthesic highway. My hope compass. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost worth it.</p>
