                <h3>On their maiden US tour with Casiotone for the Painfully Alone (aka Owen Ashworth), Otouto&#8217;s <strong>MARTHA<em>* and **HAZEL BROWN** and *</em>KISHORE RYAN</strong> eat their way through the Midwest, and play some shows along the way.
</h3>
<h2>Week One</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014609/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Hazel:</strong> We had our first show last night at the Sub-T in Wicker Park, Chicago, and it went well, thank god. So I&#8217;m sitting up in Owen&#8217;s third floor apartment feeling relieved.</p>
<p>The lead up to the show was mentally and physically strenuous, having to learn 11 songs in four days, with the pressure of playing in Owen&#8217;s (current) hometown. When we arrived, we realised that Owen was under the mistaken impression that I played bass and that Kishore might be able to drum a little with his broken arm. Alas, no. I&#8217;ve never played bass in my life &#8211; and I have tiny hands &#8211; and Kishore&#8217;s arm is still very much ?just for show?. Oh, and Martha has pretty much no knowledge of music theory when it comes to keys. So we started rehearsing like mad.</p>
<p>Luckily, we had a great basement to rehearse in, hosted and generously loaned to us by Armando, who is seriously wonderful. Armando set up the PA for us and offered us pretty much everything we needed &#8211; bottles of water, punch, the last blue Gatorade &#8211; and he also set our levels. We rehearsed at Armando&#8217;s place for about six hours everyday, stopping only for a quick burrito and horchata (amazing rice milk drink that we&#8217;d never had before) at Ricardo&#8217;s around the corner.</p>
<p>Owen punctuated these rehearsals with trips to incredible supermarkets, or ?grocery stores?. I know it sounds a bit weird, to tour the supermarkets, but you&#8217;ll only think this way if you haven&#8217;t been to Trader Joe&#8217;s (chocolate covered edamame, sunflower seed butter) or Whole Foods (porridge bar, I&#8217;ll say no more).</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3014611/640x420-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>So the days were long and we practiced more than we ever have before, but we got through the first gig and the people were very kind to Otouto and cheered a lot.</p>
<p>In Martha&#8217;s bedroom, before we left for the States, we had all awkwardly admitted how shit-scared we were to go on this tour. And the scariest thing about it is the amount of gear we have to haul. I&#8217;m pretty sure no one will recognise us when we get back. Kishore can&#8217;t lift anything because he has a broken arm, and we have SO much gear to lift in and out of the car every night for 33 nights. Martha and I will surely be ridiculously buff by the end.</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Kishore:</strong> &#8220;What can I get you, baby?&#8221; the waitress wanted to know. The menu at Roscoe&#8217;s House of Chicken ?N Waffles was a couple of pages long. I scanned it quickly. Some of the meals came with extras like scrambled eggs, but essentially there were different cuts of chicken with varying amounts of waffles. All of the meals came with whipped butter and maple syrup.</p>
<p>Despite only having met him the night before, my American buddy had taken the day off work to show me around Los Angeles, right away giving me an optimistic outlook on American people. His name was Joe.  </p>
<p>Even though Joe had lived in LA for years, he had never eaten at Roscoe&#8217;s before. He had once been to a party at Snoop Dogg&#8217;s house, which was catered by Roscoe&#8217;s, but had arrived too late and missed out on the food. A bit self-conscious about my accent and trying not to mumble, I ordered a breast and a waffle. Joe ordered a couple of wings, a couple of waffles and a beer. Afterwards it was time for a nap.</p>
<p>A couple of nights later I met up with Martha and Hazel in Chicago. Our first few days there consisted mainly of rehearsing Casiotone tracks and eating vegetarian burritos. However, I did find the time to go see Bill Orcutt playing an in-store at Reckless Records.</p>
<p>The former guitarist of noise-rock band Harry Pussy now plays an old acoustic. The low E string was tuned really low and a couple of the strings were missing. His set was kind of derivative of the blues but the violence of his playing made it really modern. At times he sung under his breath, following the guitar lines. It was over in half-an-hour. Outside, I jumped in a cab to rehearsal. That night was our first show and the next day we set off through the Midwest.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014612/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Martha:</strong> I have eaten and seen wonderful things since arriving in America. Owen kindly took us to the baseball on Tuesday night, and after having the rules explained three times I started to really enjoy it.</p>
<p>We sat in a line about halfway up the rows and rows of plastic seats wearing 2XL Chicago Cubs tees (we bullied Kish into getting one) with giant salted pretzels, corn chips with plastic cheese sauce (called ?nachos??) and big cups of Bud Lite that cost $6.75 USD. I caused quite a bit of stress as the man with the beer bucket around his neck found it challenging to understand that I was 21.</p>
<p>We caught the train home, getting off at Jackson.</p>
<p>There was this amazing hum reverberating off the walls of the long subway, with three boys in baggy jeans, sunglasses, and flat top caps singing three-part harmonies to an old gospel song at the far end. They sang like children in young men&#8217;s bodies. A choir of three, with beautifully smooth vocals, clicking and clapping to the beat with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>After explaining that Hazel and I weren&#8217;t twins (again) they let me film as they introduced themselves, and sung a Boyz II Men song with one of them doing an amazing solo over the top. That&#8217;s been the highlight of the tour for me so far.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re on the road now &#8211; in a 15-seater with eight keyboards, drums a million samplers a guitar and a bass. I am seeing amazing things everyday. I haven&#8217;t yet cried from homesickness but I swear I nearly exploded at the sound of those three boys in the subway.</p>
<h2>Week Two</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014613/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Hazel:</strong> The first two weeks of this tour involved the most driving and we&#8217;ve now completed seven or eight days. (It&#8217;s hard to keep track of time and I&#8217;m struggling to write in the right tense!)</p>
<p>To our surprise, Owen has done the vast majority of driving &#8211; he says he likes it &#8211; so we&#8217;ve been looking out the windows for hours on end. On the drive from Nebraska through Colorado to Washington, the highway was lined with enormous, towering mountains, sometimes round and green and sometimes purple, red and brown; rough and covered in ridges that make lots of jagged shadows.</p>
<p>Our first road trip &#8211; from Chicago through Iowa and Nebraska &#8211; was still my favourite. I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes away from the endless fields of corn. Depending on their age, the crops were either bright green or bright gold. When watching closely as they rushed past the window, I could see the immaculate rows flip by like a pack of cards. I was reminded of Arthur Russell&#8217;s <em>Love is Overtaking Me</em>, and like the dorky fan-girl that I am, I found myself trying to imagine what it&#8217;d be like growing up in Iowa, with the corn and the college kids.</p>

<p>Our show in Iowa was all-ages. It was held in a little underground room used later in the night for stand-up comedy. We played in the corner and the PA was pretty tiny. I experienced quite a few pretty scary electric shocks. I held the mic stand and couldn&#8217;t let go for a few seconds, as my arms, hands and cheeks shook, then I just went bright red with shock and tried not to cry. It was hard to concentrate when this happened mid-set! MB and I are also experiencing a bit of lip shock: lots of little shocks as our lips touch the mic when we sing. It feels like razor blades. Owen said its because we&#8217;re from Australia and we have the wrong voltage in us, or something dumb along those lines.</p>
<p>Five or six shows later we arrived in Victoria, British Columbia in Canada. Kish, MB and I sat in the car, writing in notebooks while it rained outside. We were parked in the driveway of the house where we were set to play in a couple of hours. We could&#8217;ve been inside taking part in the conversations about one girl&#8217;s pot-addicted pet parrot, but arh &#8230; yeah. There were snacks in the car, and it was warm and dry. We&#8217;re developed a strange love of our car. Maybe because, for the time being, it feels like home.</p>
<p>We stayed in Victoria for two nights with a lovely woman named Megan, whose housemate kindly gave MB and I her bed. I spent our first proper day off in two weeks in that bed, trying to kick this damned cough, and reading a cookbook called <em>Picnics For Lovers*. Owen stayed home to rest his ribs. He had tripped over his bag in the dark (&#8220;ate shit&#8221;, as he put it) and hurt his ribs pretty badly. He and I watched *High Fidelity</em> while the others explored downtown.</p>

<strong>Martha:</strong> So we&#8217;ve been on the road for a while now. With 13 shows under our belt, and some crazy food in our bellies. We&#8217;ve so far played in Chicago, Iowa City, Lincoln, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, Seattle, Vancouver, Victoria Island, Portland and Oakland.</p>
<p>I had my first little breakdown in Salt Lake City &#8211; after terrible altitude sickness from Denver I was so ill and Salt Lake City is one town that felt so far from home. It&#8217;s the Mormon capital of America, each street numbered depending on its distance from the main temple and is basically ruled by the church. It would have been so amazingly interesting if we didn&#8217;t arrive on a Sunday when the whole town was deserted, and I wasn&#8217;t spewing my guts out in a venue filled with amazingly pure, good looking blue-eyed tanned teenagers who were whispering about what drugs I could be on.</p>
<p>Things improved in Seattle, however. I felt more comfortable surrounded by the little cobbled streets that were filled with little espresso bars, DIY music events, and boutiques. It reminded me of Melbourne.<br/>
The manager for the show made us some delicious chocolate-and-cream-cheese cupcakes to eat backstage, and we met some lovely people who told me to do star jumps to get my energy back up &#8211; it worked and we played a nice show to a really responsive audience.</p>
<p>Like every other night on this tour we asked around about a spare floor to crash, and ended up at a member of the supporting band&#8217;s house. It has been so lovely ?couch surfing? on this tour. We have met such amazing people who have given up their floor space, spare blankets, and couches without question &#8211; we&#8217;ve also woken up to some pretty amazing cooked breakfasts as well! This house was no exception, apart from a really horrible sleazy housemate who made Haze and I pretty uncomfortable. Luckily, Hazel&#8217;s quick unforgivable tongue shut him down pretty quickly. I was given licorice tea for my throat and we were greeted with freshly brewed &#8220;French Press&#8221; coffee in the morning.</p>

Things only improved with our trip to Vancouver the next day, where we played with No Kids, a band that Haze and I have great respect for. It was a great feeling to play along side artists that have really influenced the way I think about songwriting, and that I find really inspiring.</p>
<p>We stayed with Nick, the lead singer. Julia, the adorable and lovely keys player, slept over too so that we could all hang out. We got a DOUBLE BED EACH, and awoke to a hot brekkie of steam fried (?!) eggs with chili, vintage white cheddar cheese, and steamed kale. It&#8217;s sort of like a sea lettuce, I think.</p>
<p>These little stopovers at people&#8217;s houses have really made this tour something special. I have been so surprised by the amazing generosity that strangers have shown us and how supportive the audiences have been in each city. People here seem so willing to listen and embrace new things.</p>
<p>After three weeks here in the US, I finally feel like I have a rhythm. The truck now feels like a home, and I find myself most comfortable in the front seat, watching the land rush past, or falling asleep to the hum and vibrations of a running engine. It&#8217;s been a hard run, a different venue every night, and seven hours or more of driving every day, but I finally feel used to the rush, and excited by what we are going to see next.</p>
<p>Note: French Press is just plunger coffee by the way &#8211; the coffee here is SO BAD that they see plunger coffee as a delicacy!</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Kishore:</strong> Nibbling from packets of flavored chickpeas and soybeans, we gazed out the window. Initially, I wanted to know about every little thing I saw. What&#8217;s this bridge called? What do people mean when they say ?college town?? Why is that car wash place called Jiffy Lube? The patient Owen attempted to answer my questions as best he could.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the drive from Chicago to the West Coast is a bit of a blur, cornfields morphing into desert. However, there was one thing that stuck in my mind: McFoster&#8217;s Natural Kind Caf? is located in Omaha, Nebraska. We stopped there for lunch.</p>
<p>I asked Owen about Omaha. Had he ever played there? Where there any famous bands from there? &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I played a gig here once and it was OK. The only musician that comes to mind from Omaha is that Bright Eyes guy, Conor Oberst.&#8221;</p>
<p>At McFoster&#8217;s we ate curried greens with blackened tempeh, salads with purple edible flowers and sweet potato fries with banana ketchup. Surprisingly, the ketchup was not yellow, but red, just like regular ketchup. To drink we ordered date shakes and lime smoothies and for dessert we shared a chocolate tofu cheesecake. Funnily enough, as we climbed back in our van we noticed Conor Oberst arriving. So there you have it: Snoop Dogg eats chicken waffles and Bright Eyes eats banana ketchup. (I should mention that apart from eating we were also playing shows every night.)</p>

<p>The desert morphed into mountains and we found ourselves in Salt Lake City, Utah. At this point Martha was sick and as a result, my saucepan, which I usually use as percussion, was sitting on her amp just in case she needed to throw up again. Hazel made sure everyone was aware of all this by announcing it into the microphone.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it was a funny show. But somehow something else was different, something about the audience. Even before Hazel made the announcement about the vomit saucepan, I noticed a young man in the front row grinning and laughing. What was he laughing at?</p>
<p>Earlier, as we drove into Salt Lake City I felt as though we were entering somewhere that was separate to America. Somewhere a bit cut off from the world. Salt Lake City was founded and is largely populated by Mormons. I kind of wondered if our little show in the basement of Slow Train Records might be a bit of an intrusion on their Mormon utopia.</p>
<p>After the show I ended up talking with the laughing guy. As it turned out, he loved the music. He must of just been laughing and smiling because he was enjoying himself. In general the audience seemed less jaded than an average audience, maybe a little naive, but in an endearing way.</p>
