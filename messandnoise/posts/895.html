                <h3>On his inaugural tour of China, Bluebottle Kiss? <strong>JAMIE HUTCHINGS</strong> and his drummer brother Scott travel on bullet trains, perform in alleyways, encounter bras in Beijing and drive kids to drink in Shanghai.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032330/475x375-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We have an uneventful flight with China Eastern, though I do make the unwise decision of viewing <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>. How a sketch of a 10 or so page short story can be stretched into a three-hour Hollywood epic is beyond me, but I&#8217;m pretty sure F Scott Fitzgerald would be reduced to stabbing his left eye repeatedly with a lead pencil if he saw this. Lucky for him he&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p>Rhys greets us at Shanghai Airport. He&#8217;s a Bendigo native who has been here a few years playing drums and screaming in a band called Pairs and generally making stuff happen. He&#8217;s a go-getting DIY enthusiast without all the coolsie woolsie self-righteous blather that that description often conjures up. He&#8217;s also firing and I am fizzing after the red eye flight. Scott&#8217;s skill for banter helps snuff the first meeting&#8217;s awkwardness. The train from the airport into the city takes seven minutes, but covers a distance that roughly would equate to that of Sydney to Campbelltown. At one stage we look up to discover we are traveling at 430 kilometres per hour.</p>

<p/>
<p>After Rhys gets us to the hotel, Scott and I stumble into a gigantic shopping mall and hit one of the restaurants. Understandably there are some communication problems between the staff and us. Scott orders something edible while I order something inedible. Ordering on your own here can be a bit of a luck dip. We start to make our way back to the hotel when two young girls in the mall, who insist we take them for a drink, gently accost us. One of them compliments me on the colour of my eyes. I know that on last look both of them looked like they&#8217;d been bathing in tomato juice so we figure it&#8217;s best to follow Rhys&#8217;s advice and not talk to anyone in the mall who speaks English. A typhoon called Haiku is on its way and is at blue status heading to red and later results in the evacuation of more than one million people. We figure it&#8217;s bedtime. Sigh. Double bed. Top and tail again.</p>
<p>The rain is at full pelt in the morning, but Rhys faithfully meets us and gets us to the station. It&#8217;s A-1 impressive and really without mini saints like him everything in my music world would sit around bathing in its own stink. He&#8217;s a new figure to add to my champ list.</p>
<p>My luggage is really starting to drown me. At one stage I have to crawl under a turnstile with my backpack. I feel like a turtle competing in an episode of <em>It&#8217;s a Knockout</em>. Quality television. I must document, despite the possibility of offending those of Chinese heritage, some of the local tics on display. One of these I will describe as ?oyster farming?. Later, Scott and I also come up with the alternative title of ?riding the mucus merry-go-round?. Many of us (myself a number one candidate) often feel the strong urge to redistribute certain viscous fluids around our throats or opposing nasal cavities. At the risk of public disturbance, however, we suppress these whims (however urgent). Not here! The problem that arises in pursuing this course is its apparent insatiability. You scratch that itch but it never really bleeds. At least the young gent behind us on the train to Wuhan seemed to.</p>
<p>The landscape outside the train window from Shanghai starts bleakly. Decrepit suburbia and scuzzy greenery beneath the typhoon rain. Eventually it gives out to a more rural landscape, lush bushland and farms. Quaint houses beneath gigantic concrete bridges.</p>
<p>We eventually arrive in Wuhan, the location of our first show. Our driver has patiently waited for us with his cardboard ?Hutchings? sign. For a newcomer Wuhan is an insane looking city. There&#8217;s something very <em>Bladerunner</em> about it all. Sci-fi-like bombed-out looking skyscrapers scratch the haze with scaffolding on top to boot. We cross a low bridge over a river that harbours two-lane traffic, mothers with babies in prams, helmetless cyclists, even the odd fisherman trying his luck. There are no railings. The drivers here make Italians look like pensioners from Woy Woy, but everyone just rolls with it.</p>
<p>Here lies one of the many contradictions inherent in China. One minute you&#8217;re bracing yourself for a head on collision with a shirtless man on a bicycle transporting the carcass of a dead pig and the next you&#8217;re on an air conditioned bullet train going 400 kilometres an hour. One minute your bowels are freezing over at the sight of the queue for the squat toilet, the next the seat is heated and practically does it for you. It&#8217;s nuts.</p>
<p>The usual confusion takes over for a while; wrong hotel, the driver speaking and then writing to us in Chinese to no avail, but all is resolved and we head to the venue after meeting up with the sound guy.  </p>
<p>The venue is called Vox. It&#8217;s a big dark grungy place and from what I can tell it&#8217;s probably one of the major alternative venues in town. The engineer sound checks us with an iPad. Just walking around and tweaking stuff. Impressive. One of the attractive features about all of the venues in China is that they&#8217;re equipped with their own backline. Unheard of! There are two Marshall stacks, an SVT bass head and a five piece drum kit. I plug my acoustic guitar into one of the Marshall stacks. Why not?</p>
<p>We go nextdoor for some sustenance, but all I end up with in the end is a light beer and we have to get on stage. Our timing is typically off with it being a Wednesday night and student holidays. Many of the kids are back home, but we still get around 60 punters, most of them uni age and many of them patiently clinging to the railing at the front of the stage. Scott and I haven&#8217;t played together in this format for a couple of years, however it clicks pretty quickly. After touring France with a four-piece band, it&#8217;s absorbing to pair things back to the more rhythmic and skeletal beginnings of these tunes. </p>
<p>Tom ?Ratcage? Matessi of ?This Town Touring?, who is booking most of these shows, reckons the Chinese are pretty slow on the CD-buying front. Western music and illegal downloading have pretty much grown up side-by-side over here so he&#8217;s warned us in advance that we should feel pretty lucky if we sell one CD. We sell two. A triumph!</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3032331/400x475-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
A couple of punters are keen to know a bit more about us and end up taking us across the road where, with their assistance, I proceed to make my first wise food decision. We chat back and forth with them about how they found out about the show (the interweb) and ask them what kind of music they like. There are two guys who have never met the others and two girls who are friends. One of the guys pipes up with ?Linkin Park?. The two girls concur that, yes indeed, Linkin Park are a quality act. The fourth member of the group, Jack, who tags along with us late in the piece, is a little more sophisticated and reveals his tastes as including such luminaries as Kenny G and Grover Washington Jr. Dinner costs us around eight dollars in total for the both of us.</p>
<p>I wake up at 4am and lie there til six.  We have a 10-hour train trip to Beijing ahead of us. The suspense is killing me. We meet our happy driver in the lobby and set off to the train station. The sky is a constant grey and the humidity carries some real weight. The railway station like most major railways in China is gargantuan and highly organised despite the chaos of the roads outside.</p>
<p>During our 10 hours of joy on the train I go from feeling as fresh as a daisy to a nodding off piece of compost. It&#8217;s pretty hard going. Still there&#8217;s plenty of good cheer on the train. A large group of 60-something men feast on chicken feet, beer and all types of mystery meat that is spread out on their laps and on the floor. One of them yells, ?Hello!? as I walk past. We&#8217;re the only westerners on the train and we look suitably absurd with our guitars and massive backpacks. Particularly mine which is held together by that (you guessed it) weapon of world peace &#8211; gaffa tape.</p>
<p>In a culinary sense the Chinese are extremely adventurous. Up for anything. One of the girls last night bemoaned my missed opportunity of trying the local delicacy &#8211; duck&#8217;s neck. I know that the Australian diet is as dull as dishwater but I have to ask &#8211; what do they do with the rest of the animal? The breast, thighs, etc.? It seems to be all about necks, feet, hearts, gizzards, etc. here. Waste not, want not I guess.</p>
<p>We meet up with a Kiwi girl called Jo at Beijing train station who has been assigned to get us into town. There are no taxis in sight so Jo negotiates with a black cab. With the fee settled we find ourselves wandering out of the train station in pursuit of him for about 300 metres before we stumble across his car. It&#8217;s a rusted up hatchback about the size of a large dog and his girlfriend has already bagsed the front seat.  Before long we&#8217;re hurtling along the footpath narrowly avoiding any pedestrian fatalities and weaving through the traffic.</p>
<p>The cabbies seem to relish an almost stunt car driver approach here. Their spatial awareness is second to none. It later occurs, after speaking to an expatriate of Chinese heritage, that cars for the everyman are a fairly recent phenomenon. Locals have only have only had access to them for around 20 years or so which helps explain the unique approach to negotiating traffic here. </p>
<p>Jo leads us past a square where we observe a large group of senior citizens involved in a choreographed dancing display. Here we meet Tom ?Ratcage? Mattessi. We at no stage address Tom by this name, however, it has been urgently impressed upon us by Rhys that he be referred to by this title for our purposes here. Given that Rhys goes on to being fond of repeating perverse anecdotes concerning hometown Bendigo heroes with names such as<br/>
?Spewtank? and so forth, I believe we&#8217;ll just settle here for Tom.</p>
<p>Tom (or ?Ratcage?) is a straight talking guy from Melbourne who flits between English and Chinese with ease. He informs us that he and his girlfriend Fang Li will be kindly lending us their flat while they bunk across the road at a friend&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>When we were in France it was passed onto me by a couple of the folks that ran the Binic Festival that they viewed me as their ?lucky charm?. When this was overheard by my siblings and Bruno they of course collapsed into hysterics. I was quietly chuffed. However, I did feel like a hapless explorer who had stumbled across a tropical paradise where the natives viewed him as some kind of god only to be destroyed by a contagious fatal disease said explorer has unwittingly brought along with him.  </p>
<p>Scott believes I have some bizarre magnetic force field which surrounds me and turns everything in its path to dust. This generally applies to guitar pedals and other electronic equipment, but nothing is really beyond its reach. For instance, when Tom opens his flat his key instantly breaks in half in the lock. Later that night he loses his camera and later again when Scott sleeps on the coach beneath the air conditioner he wakes to find he is virtually at sea after the air conditioner springs a leak burying half his wardrobe beneath an inch of water. He is forced to spend the next day traipsing about town in his pyjama pants. </p>
<blockquote><p>?Sylvester Stallone, looking like a surly pizza chef, is blowing everyone and anything that squeaks to smithereens on a silent TV above us.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom is also a fine assistant in the art of making wise food decisions. After soundcheck we join him and Jo at a cheap-as-chips restaurant down the road where everything is gold class. The beans in particular, which I later discover, were cooked in pork fat. Hmmm. We play in a tiny lounge-style bar called ?Jianghu?. Unlike Wuhan, where we felt we were playing on another planet, there are quite a few westerners in attendance. It&#8217;s probably my favourite show of the run as it&#8217;s perfectly set up for what we&#8217;re doing and I really feel like Scott and I are pretty much picking up where we left off with this approach. Whatever format I play once the chemistry kicks in there&#8217;s a similar absorption for me.</p>
<p>We have a fine time and have a drink afterwards with a few of the expats and try and get our head around China a little more. Fang Li reckons the low breast cancer rate among women in China is due to the late introduction of cars while Tom reckons China is moving too fast for its own good. It does strike me while here that there&#8217;s an almost awkward adolescence to the country in that its industry is going at breakneck speed while there&#8217;s a certain type of anarchy afoot attached to these growing pains. </p>
<p>The next day Tom has organised for us to do a live acoustic performance for a Chinese music website in one of the local hutongs. A hutong is basically a back alley and when the film crew choose one, we spot a bicycle with a metal cart which Scott clambers onto and begins to use as a makeshift drum kit. There&#8217;s traffic no matter where you are in Beijing so there&#8217;s a constant stream of pedestrians and cyclists throughout the performance. Some curious. Some oblivious.  Like most shows. Scott has the privilege of modelling his pyjama pants for the performance due to last night&#8217;s air conditioning debacle. One curious older gentleman who watches has a walking stick which when unfolded converts itself into a stool. A fine invention.</p>

<p/>
<p>Later that night we play at a venue called The Hot Cat Club. En route Tom shares some of the frustrations typical of bringing bands in from all over the world into a place like China. He has sworn off bands from a certain western country after a six-piece multi-unit shifting hard rock act who travel with an 11-person entourage greet him with a query relating to the location of the nearest Starbucks. Apparently they then proceeded to spend around six hours a day from thereon in hovering over their individual Wi-Fi connected laptops. He was told not to communicate with the singer due to his chronic shyness and when suggesting a refreshing beverage or some sightseeing after the show he was told in no uncertain terms: ?Tom, we&#8217;re here to work.? Professionalism! It&#8217;s overrated.</p>
<p>Communicating with the sound guy at Hot Cat proves to be a comedy of errors. My acoustic initially only sounds marginally better than a fence paling, which is no doubt not helped by the fact this poor instrument is being held together by gaffa tape. For an expensive guitar my Martin has the constitution of a mosquito. With some on the ball interpreting from Tom and Black (Steve from the opening act) things turn around and by the end of the show we and the sound guy are besties. The main support act consists of some really sweet guys from midwest America and a young Chinese guy who spent a couple of years in Kensington, Sydney. They play folky bluegrass kind of stuff and are a great bunch. The show is a bit of a washout attendance wise, but those who turn up are pretty tuned in which helps sync things a little better.</p>
<p>The next day we have to get up at 8am to meet Tom and take the train to Shanghai. I wake up at around 3.30am and can&#8217;t seem to nod off again. I take a couple of sleeping pills and at 8am when Scott wakes me I feel like a jelly blubber being prodded with a stick. Scott has fallen in love with a local dumpling outlet Tom turned us onto. They&#8217;re delicious and they cost around 20 cents Australian each. Three of these babies and you&#8217;re as full as a goog. </p>
<p>The train from Beijing to Shanghai averages around 275 km/hr. Farmland flies by. Sylvester Stallone, looking like a surly pizza chef, is blowing everyone and anything that squeaks to smithereens on a silent TV above us.  As far as I hear, TV censorship is pretty tight over here so it&#8217;s curious how every passenger on board can happily lose themselves in this monotonous violence without a qualm. At one stage one of the baddies in said film gets set on fire. The camera does a slow motion pan over to one of the heroes who in a valiant display of pure righteous indignation is suddenly inspired to rush over and king hit the burning bad guy in the head. Isn&#8217;t being fried alive enough? Nope. And then this piece of genius starts all over again. From the top.</p>
<p>We meet Rhys (?The Chiefly One? as Scott addresses him) at Shanghai Library train station. We check into another hotel and cab it to an industrial/student part of town called Yangou Qu where we are playing a venue called Live Bar. It&#8217;s a small split-level rock club with loads of gear we help ourselves to onstage. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032333/475x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Rhys is keen to hit Dominos Pizza next door for dinner swearing to us that it&#8217;s far superior to the wet cardboard and cheese style combos they serve up back in Oz. Scott makes an executive decision and we again dine local with Rhys ordering away in Chinese. Despite my desperate efforts to conceal it, Rhys finally picks up on my total lack of ability with chopsticks. I then reveal my total lack of ability on a number of fronts and he kindly diagnoses me with dyspraxia. Up until this point I have never heard of this ailment though on further inspection I discover some telling signs. Apart from the Bronte sisters apparently having this there are very few selling points. I in turn decide after some research that Rhys has coprolalia. Scott and I make enquiries as to how he keeps his prolific swearage under control while working as an administrator and teacher at an esteemed local school. Rhys informs us that as soon as he dons a suit and tie his coprolalia dissipates.</p>
<p>Outside the venue a traditional Chinese musical is being performed at ear splitting volume. Both the heavily made up leading man and woman have affected mega high pitched voices which I am informed require lifelong training from childhood on. Scott and I are fascinated by the small orchestra who provide the live backing music at the front of the stage. We manage to view the orchestra from behind. It is made up of three traditional Chinese stringed instruments playing dizzyingly dissonant and complex oriental melodies but it&#8217;s the percussion that&#8217;s hardest to follow. </p>
<p>The average age of the musicians would be around 70 years old and they appear to be led by one of the percussionists who is stationed towards the back hitting sticks on a type of traditional Chinese drum that looks vaguely like a bongo. What appear to be random hits are clearly from his concentrated gaze and cues carefully planned. Further to the back again a man and a woman occasionally provide an outburst of explosive cymbal smashing where the note seems to bend on impact. Unlike the more traditional western take on percussion, these bursts of sound seem to be triggered by specific melodies and often the leading percussionist signals for them to tone it down or bring it up.</p>
<p>Scott and I explore the building the venue is located in by climbing up an endless spiral of concrete stairs to a grand view of Shanghai on the roof. While looking for the elevator we spy a sticker on one of the unit doors depicting Uncle Sam in his traditional pointing pose. It reads, ?Uncle Sam Wants You to Stop Smoking?, and that reminds me of another curio in regard to China. You can pretty much smoke wherever you want in China with the exception of trains and planes. At one stage I do see a non-smoking sign in a restaurant, but beneath a shirtless man puffs away merrily. </p>
<blockquote><p>?One minute your bowels are freezing over at the sight of the queue for the squat toilet, the next the seat is heated and practically does it for you.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Chinese men are not a vain lot. The shirtless look is understandable with the humidity but it&#8217;s a far cry from the popular shorn, tattooed, buffed to infinity look of home. What is unique is what is referred to by an ex-pat as ?The Beijing Bra?, though I see this look in every city we frequent. This look involves a t-shirted and very sweaty male rolling his shirt vertically over his belly to exhibit a kind of male midriff. It&#8217;s a fashion I haven&#8217;t witnessed since Boy George&#8217;s one time rival, Marilyn, gave the male midriff a good crack back in the ?80s.</p>
<p>Rhys, ?The Chiefly One?, has done well on the promo front with the local kids slowly filtering in and despite Live Bar being a bit out of the way there are a few westerners that have cabbed it in as well.  </p>
<p>Rhys opens with a solo set. It kind of sounds like Robert Forster if he&#8217;d grown up listening to Fugazi instead of Jonathan Richman. A lot of screaming and quite a lot of fun. Next up are Reykjavictim which consists of a young Canadian guy with a keyboard velcroed to his guitar singing in fluent Chinese over programmed beats and Rhys on drums.  He has a lot of triggers, leads, etc. I imagine you would need some kind of engineering degree to work his set up. I talk to him later and discover that yes, he indeed does have some kind of engineering degree. After Reykjavicitim a local chap named Wei Wu Chun plays. He sounds like a Chinese Thom Yorke and has a pedal that does harmonies for him. </p>
<p>The crowd is pretty rowdy now. When the Chinese are having a fine time they love to get vocal and the crowd&#8217;s vocals at this point are at an all time high. I fear we will be drowned out. </p>
<p>I chat to a local journalist called Kat who is from the Philippines and she tells me that Mark Kozelek toured here recently and spent most of the gig chucking tantys in response to the hub of noise the crowd made during his show, so I decide to ditch any ?quiet please? lecturing. Things stay loud, but refreshingly, it&#8217;s a different kind of loud to the Aussie ?let&#8217;s yell over the top of the sad sack in the corner? type of impertinence. It&#8217;s sort of celebratory and encouraging. I&#8217;m generally hesitant about laying on the cheese too thick but when we close with ?After the Flood? Scott and I hand out whatever bits of percussive junk are lying around and the kids eat it up laying down a dilapidated racket.</p>
<p>In China the bars don&#8217;t appear to close until everyone leaves of their own free will. Even if there&#8217;s just one comatose guy in the corner, the staff will patiently wait until he escorts himself to the door. Subsequently we&#8217;re here for a while.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3032332/450x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In the AM we meet up with The Chiefly One and his wife Kenji. We go to a part of town called Tianzifang and have breakfast at a place called Kommune. I make the mistake of ordering what appears to be a flat white on the menu. It&#8217;s delivered in a bottle. Rhys consumes twice his own weight in bacon. We browse around the hutongs, spy a toilet-themed ice-cream shop and try not to lose Scott who is generally around 50 metres behind photographing, interacting with locals and practicing his unique habit of loudly humming bass lines.</p>
<p>Rhys has organised a casual gig at a venue called The Melting Pot not far from our hotel. The owner/MC/sound/everything person is a Taiwanese lady in a very tiny dress called Ruby. The guitar mic seems to be set to ?feedback in a totally horrendous fashion? throughout the entire soundcheck. We suggest that perhaps it is turned up to 11 on her desk and to relax it a little, but it&#8217;s another sound person impasse so we try a few alternatives before a decision is reached to abandon the little sonic cul de sac we&#8217;re in and ?see how it goes?.</p>
<p>I do an interview with a gentleman named Kay Fan for a magazine called <em>Hit Music</em>.  The magazine has The Jesus and Mary Chain on the cover and inside is a fold-out poster of them which looks like it was taken around 1987. We are sitting outside the venue below two speakers which intermittently blare big band swing at a deafening volume. My dad would be in heaven. Kay Fan and I lip read which is a challenge given our opposing heritages. We play without incident and hand the audience members bits of percussion which they happily amuse themselves with. We force Rhys to play bongos which he appears to quite enjoy. </p>
<p>We meet up with a friend of my manager called Alexis. Like Rhys, Alexis is a teacher only she&#8217;s from the States and as well as buying my box set after the show, she treats us to lunch at Di Shui Dong on Maoming Lu. That old southern hospitality. Scott orders something gelatinous-looking which we do our best to ignore. Alexis and Rhys make good food decisions for me.</p>
<p>We then head down to Cellar Door Wines. Earlier in the week I had been unexpectedly copied in an email from chief CEO of Non Zero Records/IT industry guru/destroyer of worlds Nick Carr. A former Chinese employee of his now runs a wine bar and Nick put a shout out to him to have a crack at putting on a solo show for me in his new establishment. Rhys in his inimitable style takes up the slack. After some negotiation Andy the owner agrees. We discover it&#8217;s more bottle-o than wine bar. There is no PA so Rhys drags a Karaoke amplifier from beneath his bed, purchases a fake sm58 and a $2 mic stand and we&#8217;re away. As expected it&#8217;s a little ugly sounding. Andy, however, is a gracious host and while his establishment is a little brightly lit, he has done a fine job of letting his clientele know and I play to around 30 men, women and children. This includes a boy of around seven years of age who swills wine around his glass like a true connoisseur. Andy has also created a Jamie Hutchings drinks list for the night. When will I be famous? Now.</p>

<p/>
<p>I sell more CDs at this show than any other perhaps due to the more well heeled demographic which frequent Andy&#8217;s bottle-o. My last customer buys the box set. She is very complimentary and then ads that the show would have been perfect if I&#8217;d topped it off with a cover of &#8216;Hotel California&#8217;. </p>
<p>I decide to head outside away from the riff raff where I join Scott and an old friend of ours called Shannon who has popped in. Shannon and his wife moved to China several years ago and we have seen very little of them since. The softly spoken Shannon leads a substantial conversation in which we cover topics such as the Chinese political system, adoption, business and God before Rhys skilfully takes charge and detours the discussion into a blow-by-blow account of his hernia operation including an agonizing description of a tube being inserted into his member. We call it a night.</p>
<p>On Monday morning Rhys gives us a whirlwind tour of Shanghai. We visit a musty basement which houses the world&#8217;s biggest Mao-era exhibition of propaganda posters and a shopping centre which houses the largest collection of $2 shops in the known world. Rhys valiantly tries to assist Scott in his search for the perfect pair of mirrored aviators, but comes up empty. Scott eats more slime. We visit an old slaughterhouse which has a top floor made of glass which makes my feet dizzy. We end up drinking on the 87th floor of the Shanghai World Financial Centre. It houses free telescopes and the world&#8217;s most interactive amenities.</p>
<p>Then we catch the 430-kilometre-per-hour train to the airport again and fly home.</p>
