<p>New York! Some things would fall apart in New York and some things would be among the best experiences of our lives. The ?red-eye? flight from LA via Atlanta to New York had something to do with our unravelling, as did the dramatic climate difference! My ?Muscle Beach? singlet was not going to get a showing in NYC. Two weeks of mirage-brain intensity may also have played a role &#8211; just maybe. Sickness set in, maybe scurvy, maybe common colds; we&#8217;ll never know. </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039187/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Our first night in NYC was one of the most surreal of the tour. We met and rehearsed with Sal Principato of downtown, no-wave legendary group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Liquid">Liquid Liquid</a>. I am <em>trying</em> to keep this tour diary succinct so I will not gush on, but I can tell you that hearing Liquid Liquid for the first time over 10 years ago was a formative experience that led to me creating NO ZU. Sal is an energetic, generous and fun-loving man. He quickly and very naturally became part of the ever-expanding ZU Family and a good friend. The rehearsal was great and, like that crazy Monterrey festival show, I&#8217;m glad I took some photos. He would go on to play percussion (and sing his post-LL band <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/623503-Fist-Of-Facts">Fist of Facts</a>? song ?Wah-Wah? with us) at our next three shows in New York.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039188/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Our first show in NYC was at a new venue, Trans Pecos. At a pre-show dinner Andrew ordered a soup (for one) that came served with a ladle. America, if a soup needs to be served with a ladle, isn&#8217;t it a little big?</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039189/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Maria Minerva played before us. She presented a performance of relentless beats and a plethora of seemingly opposing forces; a calmly manic prescience, melodic and tuneful shouting/screams and an aggressive/vulnerable persona.  She&#8217;s captivating and it was really great to play with her. Later she joined us to sing during our last track, ?Fa Foma Fi?.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039190/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>It was a small crowd getting down to our set, but the vibe was right and we felt right at home. The drums and percussion reverberated endlessly in the cement box of a space. There was an abrasive attack to the sound <em>and</em> feeling of our first show with Sal. It was all beaming smiles and fast heart-rates and then a chronic, sciatic back problem of mine flared up worse than it ever has during a show and I could barely stand. Having to lay down, samba-whistle-in-mouth, after each song, Daphne was left to explain my strange behaviour. </p>
<p>The rest of the ZUs spent the next half-week exploring the city and I spent a few days wondering if I would have to cancel the rest tour, barely able to move and holed up in our Bushwick den.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039192/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Somewhere between encounters with an acupuncturist, some scented candles, panpipes, too much kale, several NBA games, Wholefoods, some Vangelis music and Central Park, I became mysteriously and unexplainably healed. Must have been Vangelis.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039194/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The band and I were now ready to go into Adrian T&#8217;s school&#8217;s studio from 1am-8am to record a spontaneous groove live with Sal P. Given the ridiculous time of night/day (and all of those panpipes and chia pods), it&#8217;s understandable that the result was a rather zonked, cosmic-journey type of opiate groove. </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039193/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The sun was up, but as we waited for a maxi-cab it was minus 11 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to Bushwick, and back to Hood Luv in particular.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039195/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>One of the final <em>mirage-brain</em> moments came the next night at our show at Baby&#8217;s All Right &#8211; when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chance">James Chance</a> (a.k.a. James White or, to the tax department, James Siegfried) walked in to the bandroom/walkway &#8211; with his longtime partner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=f2kfcnifWYg">Judy Taylor</a> (with whom I had a good boogie later). James and I had been emailing back and forth for a couple of months and I wasn&#8217;t sure if the show would work out. It did and it&#8217;s too much for the brain to handle. His all-singing, James Brown-shuffling, sax-shronking DJ/karaoke set was like some kind of dream conceptual-art performance. But you don&#8217;t need to use your brain to get it &#8211; you just need to move your body, and we did so without hesitation.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039196/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039198/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We played very late &#8211; too late. A last-minute team-up with Siberia Records to put the show on had helped to bring people early, but to play at 2:30am on a school night was a stretch. We played fine. I&#8217;m just really glad that I had the chance to see James play and <em>contort himself</em> with that free-sax.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039199/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Our second-last show and the final one with Sal was another last-minute situation. It was a show secured at The Cake Shop just days before by Sal when another venue cancelled on us &#8211; for the second time. A Facebook status from the booker of the original venue on the same night was an interesting choice. I&#8217;m so happy it all worked out, because that last show with Sal on the Lower East Side felt like it was his place and his people, and it was special. </p>
<p>The simplistic PA setup struggled with our seven-piece, but that didn&#8217;t matter in that cavernous, narrow basement space. A combination of the previous night&#8217;s not-so-great show, the fact the five-week tour was close to ending and that it was Sal&#8217;s final night with us appeared to bring with it an urgent/sentimental bent. Also, when you have a crowd that lovingly/charmingly/New York-ally gives you the finger when you take their photo (see final photo below) and you&#8217;re sharing the bill with a band who that you love and connect with (<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16648-hidden-fees-so-what">Hidden Fees</a> &#8211; see photo just below), everybody relaxes into the performance and the groove gets deeper. Deep, deep in a Manhattan basement and it was good. </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039200/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We played Fist of Fact&#8217;s ?Wah-Wah? the best we had that night and Sal later enthusiastically encouraged me to have ZU continue to play it in our set &#8211; a <em>mirage-brain</em> big finale.  </p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3039201/600x455-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>One last show remained for the tour. My camera battery had finally died and so, unfortunately, I can&#8217;t show pictures from my camera from it. It didn&#8217;t occur to me that I would be presenting the pictures like this, so finding a battery the next day wasn&#8217;t a priority. In fact, the whole next day was dedicated to finding (expensive) medical treatment for Daphne (vocals) who, over the last few days had developed a flu to the extent that she was by now suffering from pneumonia-like symptoms! Hers wasn&#8217;t just a common cold, it seems. </p>
<p>We had to embrace the constantly-mutating/evolving (maybe devolving) nature of NO ZU and play that night without her. A macho, muscle-funk ZU set (with me singing Daphne&#8217;s parts) it would be. We were closing the launch of <a href="/news/4641227">Shorts</a> (part-expat group with <em>our</em> Adrian T on guitar and frontman Michael Caterer, formerly of Love Connection) debut 7? at a loft party in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Only a party where somebody actually lives can bring with it such a relaxed yet debaucherous atmosphere, and it felt like such a comfortable and real ending for the tour &#8211; amongst friends and friends of friends. Sweat poured and the set was a wild meltdown of heat-beat &#8211; so fun and amongst a great moving sea of friendly bodies. </p>
