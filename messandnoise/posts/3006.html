                <h3>Whether as a solo artist, a gun-for-hire or as a member of several tumultuous outfits, Spencer P Jones has carved out a career by doing things his own way. He speaks candidly to <strong>RUTH MCIVER<em>* about 30 eventful years in the biz. Photos by *</em>ROBERT CARBONE</strong>.

<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006652/440x660-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Spencer P Jones answers my phone request for an interview with manic enthusiasm, unfurls a string of jokes and threatens to rock up to the <a href="/articles/3655846">?new?</a> Birmingham Hotel in a pith helmet, leaving me a lasting first impression akin to a rock&#8217;n?roll Genghis Khan. He arrives an hour-and-a-half late for our meeting, more soberly attired in a black peaked leather cap and with a reserved, apologetic manner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to determine if Jones is such an old hand at playing the eccentric, incorrigible rock star on stage that he has inadvertently adopted this persona in real life. In conversation, however, he does drop the facade with a kind of wearied candidness that belies a genuine disregard for public opinion. You might even say he wears his heart, a little worse for wear, on his sleeve. A born conversationalist and a skilled storyteller, Jones is clearly in his element in the pub, be it on or off stage. Naturally comedic, with a droll, bone-dry sense of humour, he intersperses his stories with physical impressions and amusing accents for effect.</p>
<p>Despite his reputation for excess, Jones has a remarkable memory for the finer details of the dealings, dalliances and debaucheries that have shaped his 30-odd-year musical career. When I quiz him about ?Thanks?, a song that reads like a personal resume of drug and alcohol abuse, he responds verbatim as he did in an earlier interview I&#8217;d read. ?If I did all the amount of drugs that everyone thinks I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;d have been dead a long time ago,? he exclaims. The song, says Jones, is a joke, a cautionary tale, but he ?hilariously? insists he&#8217;s done every drug listed, and uses a recent anecdote to verify his claim. </p>
<p>?I went to the doctor and he said, ?Have you taken any drugs in the last week?? And I said, ?Yes?. He goes, ?What have you had? Have you had marijuana?? And I said, ?Yes?. And he goes, ?What else have you had?? I hadn&#8217;t had speed in like two years and I just happened to have some days ago and a line of coke on Friday and temazepam and I started thinking, ?This is like my song, the irony of it, and I&#8217;m telling my GP.??</p>
<p>He does have days off, he maintains, and a six-year-old son he hasn&#8217;t seen a lot of late, so he wants to be on top of his game. Jones also likes to have a good time on stage and has an ongoing deal with the crowd: a song request in exchange for a shot of tequila.</p>
<p>Raised on a farm in Te Awamutu, New Zealand, which he jokingly refers to as the ?Memphis? of the North Island (the famous Finn brothers hail from there too), Spencer&#8217;s paternal side were funeral directors turned farmers. He recalls seeing corpses before the age of seven and narrowly escaped being shipped off to embalming school. After his father broke his back, the family relocated to Auckland where they ran a small newsagency. Jones would often raid the music magazines on the shelf and religiously listened to local radio. </p>
<p>Despite being the most musically inclined of the family, Jones was the last in a line of siblings who ?hopelessly? failed piano lessons. He was dismissed as a lost cause before his talents could surface. It was Spencer&#8217;s elder brother who died tragically in August 1970, who championed his cause. That same year, on Jones? 14th birthday, his parents bought him his first guitar, which he still owns today. Entirely self taught, he was intent on uncovering the roots of the music he admired &#8211; initially it was The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison, but later it was Dylan, Hendrix and whatever else he found in his older brother&#8217;s stack of records.</p>
<p>Jones? point of references are reflexively musical, which is not surprising considering his CV. There&#8217;s seemingly one degree of separation between himself and nearly every major recording artist in the Australian and American underground music scene from the late ?70s onwards. The ?P? in his name is a story unto itself, which stretches back to when he signed a record deal with the Beasts of Bourbon. Polydor had also signed a black Scottish soul singer named Spencer Jones at the time, so he often received letters from APRA asking if he was the songwriter of ballads such as, ?I Want You Darling? or ?Baby, You&#8217;re Beautiful?. ?[They&#8217;re] all the kind of song titles that I&#8217;d never write in a million years,? he chuckles. He became Spencer P Jones to ensure that ?that guy didn&#8217;t get any of my royalty cheques?. </p>
<blockquote><p>?I found a lot of great things came from letting go of what I thought my beliefs were at any given time and jumping in the deep end. It&#8217;s been very rewarding and I&#8217;ve grown as an artist. If I only I had the same success with relationships.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jones cackles when I recite just a few of the artists he has collaborated with live or as a session musician over the years: Paul Kelly, Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, Tex Perkins, Chris Bailey, Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Billy Ficca, Conway Savage, Brian Ritchie and Kid Congo Powers to name a mere few. ?You could say that I&#8217;ve lived a charmed life,? he wryly states. He goes on to explain how he never actively pursued opportunities that came to him: ?I&#8217;d get phone calls from people going, ?Hey, can you do this?? &#8211; I found it difficult to say no to everything in my life and I found myself overcommitted all the time. I found a lot of great things came from letting go of what I thought my beliefs were at any given time and jumping in the deep end. It&#8217;s been very rewarding and I&#8217;ve grown as an artist. If I only I had the same success with relationships.?</p>
<p>It was his knack for being in the right place at the right time that lead Jones to Sydney in 1976, en route to London to become a ?rock star?. (He eventually arrived in London 20 years after the fact, where he played to full houses and a readymade fanbase, as he points out triumphantly.) It was through his association with North 2 Alaskans &#8211; a comedy cabaret act who mixed rock&#8217;n?roll with psychedelia &#8211; that lead Jones to found legendary country-punk outfit The Johnnys. In an early interview with <em>The Alternative Gig Guide</em>, Jones first coined the phrase ?country punk cow-punk, Nashville new wave?. He predicted that this was the future of music; a kind of country with a new, fresh punk energy, devoid of the ?schmaltzy? redneck qualities and racism associated with traditional country and western. ?And I was right,? he crows.</p>
<p>Jones is perhaps most famous for his notoriously volatile and intermittent relationship with The Beasts of Bourbon, who he walked out on during the band&#8217;s 2008 European tour. He has typically perfect recall of his providential meeting with an 18-year-old Tex Perkins at the Dolphin Hotel in Sydney circa 1983. Perkins, he explains, had come down from Brisbane with his band The Dum-Dums the week before. When they couldn&#8217;t fulfill a booking, The Beasts &#8211; Jones and Perkins, along with Kim Salmon (guitar), James Baker (drums) and Boris Sudjovic (bass) &#8211; were formed. ?He [Tex] didn&#8217;t really have any form at that stage and I&#8217;d already been playing in Melbourne since ?78,? Jones recalls. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006651/440x576-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
He considers himself ?the last man standing? from the original lineup and cites Perkins? ?intolerance? as the reason for the breakdown in their relationship and ultimately the band&#8217;s demise. While Jones was keen to record a follow-up to 2007?s <em>Little Animals</em>, he claims Perkins was more interested in being a celebrity. ?Playing with me and Brian [Hooper, bassist] and Tony [Pola, drummer] &#8211; it&#8217;s like an ordeal for him that he has to put with for his own credibility,? Jones says.</p>
<p>The relationship was made all the more strained and claustrophobic when the band toured Europe by bus. The straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, he says, was when Perkins began mixing the Ladyboyz album on his laptop. Jones perceived the project &#8211; a sort of tongue-in-cheek soft-rock cover band &#8211; as artistically regressive. ?I walked out on the tour because I didn&#8217;t want to hear the Ladyboyz every fucking morning,? he explains. </p>
<p>When asked about the likelihood of a Beasts reunion &#8211; the band has recently re-released their first three albums as a <a href="/releases/2000405">box set</a> &#8211; Jones frankly admits that ?it ain&#8217;t over until the fat lady sings?, albeit with a disclaimer. ?He [Perkins] would have to ring me up and apologise for being such an arsehole.?</p>
<p>We move on from the contentious topic of The Beasts after a few more drinks and cigarette breaks into a discussion about being a singer-songwriter, a solo artist, a collaborator and a general gun-for-hire. Jones says the current line-up of Spencer P Jones and The Escape Committee &#8211; drummer Dave Nicholls (Love Addicts), guitarist John Nolan (Bored, Powdermonkeys) and bassist Helen Cattanach (Moler) &#8211; is the right combination of people and personalities. He describes his 12-year musical relationship with Cattanach as a rare case of personal and professional symbiosis. ?[She is] like a sister,? he enthuses, she&#8217;s always there for me. She always hits the right note, the right chord and therefore she&#8217;s always welcome.?</p>
<p>When I ask Jones about what he&#8217;s like to play with, he&#8217;s characteristically blunt. He reckons he&#8217;s difficult to read and may ?freak people out? with his body language. He also has an instinctive, organic and somewhat punk-rock approach to recording. ?I&#8217;m not going to work on something for five days till it sounds perfect,? he explains. ?I&#8217;ll work on it for five takes or scrap it altogether.? As for his live approach, it has to be spontaneous, flawed and improvised. A broken string is something he won&#8217;t consider stopping the show for. ?Some people I&#8217;ve worked with are like, ?Oh man, that&#8217;s really out of tune. Why didn&#8217;t you do something?? I&#8217;m like, ?Remove that dour look from your face and put on a smile. We can really turn this into something here.?? He does, however, conceded that ?a lot of people don&#8217;t subscribe to my theory about how rock&#8217;n?roll should be presented or indeed in how to entertain people?.</p>
