                <h3>Who better to tell us about the five bands from Hobart you should be listening to than M+N <a href="/icons/3898678">icon</a> <strong>JULIAN TEAKLE</strong>. A true champion of the city&#8217;s underground scene, Teakle is a member of The Frustrations, The Native Cats and The Bad Luck Charms; a presenter at Edge Radio; and last year released the second volume of ?Community?, his compilation of current local acts.
</h3>
<p>Singling out five acts that have been catching my attention in Hobart recently has been hard, but also great because it allows me to reflect on how much great music can go on in this town. There&#8217;s been a noticeable influx of newer faces and younger heads at shows this year, including all that bubbles underneath (house gigs, collaborations etc.) when people get inspired by new experiences and opportunities. The access to decent affordable recording gear these days means a lot more stuff gets documented than it used to in Tasmania. For someone who has experienced Hobart&#8217;s music scene (mostly) ebb and (sometimes) flow over the years I feel pretty optimistic about the scene now and the future of music here. As long as everyone doesn&#8217;t move to Thornbury next year?</p>
<p/>
<h2>M.O.1.O</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3030154/640x425-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>I&#8217;m not usually the best person to ask about the heavier music scenes but M.O.1.O are one of those bands that defy the genre ghetto with the strength of their songs and sounds. It really struck me watching the audience at the <em>Community 2</em> compilation launch while M.O.1.O played how encompassing their sound is. There was the tornado dervish of hair of several metal heads head banging alongside indie rockers and noiseniks, frugging together in unified heaviosity. Kind of a potent visual representation of how small the Hobart music scene can be with its sometimes intertwining of underground music genres.</p>
<p>M.O.1.O&#8217;s Matt Warren (drums/vocals) and Aaron Metcalf (guitar) are veterans of the local noise/metal scene, both most noticeably in ?90s art-metallers Bodies Drawn Backwards, and Matt has been a very active performer both solo and collaboratively in countless experimental/noise projects and was behind Damo Suzuki two visits to Hobart. All these activities seem to inform M.O.1.O&#8217;s sound: the Killing Joke/Black Sabbath grooves, the Krautrocky drive and space, sprinkled with the more esoteric end of Earache Records output and informed by a dark psychedelic undertone that wouldn&#8217;t be far out of place on the soundtrack to some ?70s Italian horror film. They are currently working on an album that will be out on Los Angeles-based record label Sonoptik later this year.</p>

<h2>Treehouse</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3030155/640x383-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>About two or three years ago there was influx of new, interesting bands coming from Hobart&#8217;s Eastern Shore suburbs. A much younger crew than what was playing in inner-city Hobart at the time, they were getting their P-plates and playing house shows in places like Howrah and Bellerive. They eventually started crossing the Tasman Bridge, getting shows in the few music venues in the inner-city. Treehouse were among this crew and impressed me very early on. Their sound initially had a somewhat lighter vibe like the Clean or Television but has progressed to powerful, melodic and punkish sound kind of reminiscent of Sebadoh during the <em>III* and *Smash Your Head On The Punk Rock</em> era &#8211; their emotive (NOT EMO), wrenching molten nods to their hardcore youth.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Treehouse have grown into quite a potent live act; a truly wonderful composite of its parts, a total freakin? unit. Nobody slacks off in this trio and everyone services their splendid songs. I&#8217;m pretty intrigued to see what these guys will do in the future and how they&#8217;ll evolve over time. Check out their Bandcamp <a href="http://treetheband.bandcamp.com/">page</a>, it&#8217;s good shit!</p>

<h2>Drunk Elk</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3030156/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Drunk Elk have been playing around Hobart for a couple of years, making a very seamless shift for the original synth/bass/vocals line-up with the replacement of the synth with Ben Mason&#8217;s darkly chiming guitar. I swear sometimes Ben uses icicles for guitar picks and if you&#8217;d experienced a Hobart winter this would kind of make sense. Matched with Dave Askew&#8217;s morose, compelling crooning and Simon Krause&#8217;s tunefully anchored bass playing, Drunk Elk have become one of the most starkly gripping bands to come out of Hobart in years, both on disc and live.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotta admit I find it hard sometimes to watch this brilliant and bleak band, the title of their album, <em>Under Neon Lights</em>, summing up the singular harshness of their sound. They bum me out but in such beautiful way. They are probably better known outside of Hobart, which is fucken shame, but have been picking up well deserved kudos from influential mainland and international underground music types and putting out records overseas. Power to&#8217;em.</p>

<h2>Naked</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3030157/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Naked started out as home recording project for local punk beatnik Kieran Sullivan and he started sharing his music through the internet. I kind of ignored them for a while because I thought the name was shit, sounding like some ?sensual? goth-lite pop band that would&#8217;ve signed to a major label&#8217;s fake indie imprint in 1993. Keiran gave me a copy of the <em>Black Teeth* album and although I still thought the name was kind of crap the songs were great. I was impressed with these heaving, churning lo-fi tunes augmented with kitchen implement-style percussion so I grabbed a song for the *Community 2</em> compilation.</p>
<p>Around this time Kieran was putting together a band to play his creations live &#8211; Rob Fisher on guitar, Will Mann on drums and Jordy Marson on bass. A lot more punkish in their delivery of the original songs, their shows can sometimes dissolve into hilarious, chaotic and sometimes (literally) naked confusion. But mostly Kieran remains a charismatic, entertaining frontman while Jordy, Rob and Will bring a real zing to the songs in a live setting with their playing. Of course I should disclose that I released a tape by Naked recently but only to prepare you for future paparazzi shots of me and the band swimming with Jay-Z and Beyonce in Ibizia, stemming from the sales of this awesome cassette!</p>

<h2>Dogtower</h2>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3030158/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>Dogtower sound very much like a Hobart band to me, akin something you might have seen at house show in 1982, 1997 or 2012 &#8211; people still coming to terms with their instruments but taking to the music with drive and passion, playing like nothing else mattered. Like all the stupid boy punk from the ?90s/?00s never happened. Dogtower are an anomaly for me, in terms of Hobart bands because I don&#8217;t know any of them, which is strange, especially when you know how small the Hobart scene is. But it proves that this small town can still smack you out what you think you know, and then make it all shiny and exciting and new very quickly. Especially when a bunch of people who moved here to study get it together to make such a glorious noise.</p>
<p>Sonically the band remind of the scrappy DIY sounds of acts like the Mekons in their <em>Never Been In A Riot</em> phase or super early era Wire. And in some strange linking in my aging brain to local 1990s bands like HMAS, Honeypet and Terracehead, who I&#8217;m pretty sure none of the Dogtower folk would have heard of. So I guess saying something about the local water might have some credence but it&#8217;s likely more what a town like Hobart can nurture. Dogtower have no recordings yet but have toured on the mainland. Some of the lyrics I can discern from the several times I have seen them seem to have a slight political bent, in a fun but not overtly dogmatic way. They are a hoot live and I can already hear some proto-classics brewing among their setlist. Somebody needs to put out a 7? by these people.</p>
