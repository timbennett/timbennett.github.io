<h2>?First Born Son?</h2>
<p>This tune is essentially about a white-sick chile taking it easy on the holiday-taking tablets and having a wild time while at same time not having worrying about the day-to-day drudgery of its every-week family life at home in caravan world. Otherwise perhaps it&#8217;s a song about all the sweet smelling things that may make the chile go ?burp? from the end of the child that doesn&#8217;t look like it will ever talk, other than to say, ?Windy.?</p>
<h2>?Bear?</h2>
<p>That tune is defo related to the issues that face a man once he realises the full size of his freedomz. Not knowing how to deal with all of his freedomz exactly, the man realises that freedom is really a function of his hair lengths and so he does all the things that he thinks a basic ?freedom creature? may wish to do. The song is basically all about all the ?freedym wind? and all the pleasures that such a wind has been known to bring (dancing) with it (and all the pyne).</p>
<h2>?Wow?</h2>
<p>Which tune that you know can rightly express the feelings that you get when you feel a certain ?wowness? enter your sphere of self dowt? Yessum, its got to be this tuen. At times a disappointing look at the life you couldn&#8217;t imagine having, as well as a depressing examination of the failures of the tests that your mummy mentioned that you should avoid taking for as you enter the servitude of the life that modern industry needs you to feel that you deserve. A bitter, dark chocolate like, this one is bound to be a hit with all the small kids under the age of seven billion (male).</p>
<h2>?Jungle?</h2>
<p>This song from the outset is keen and we wrote it to &#8211; to get your middle puffing like a smoking dead dog and this number doesn&#8217;t file to fill your emptiness with a jelly so red, that the soft luggage bag that is your soft shell rejoices when it has been scented with the sauce that pours down your chins as you hit play on that shiny machiner machine. Sure, its not as big a tune as ?Toto? was for that band, but given its modest sucko-centric illusions of pop greatness, it&#8217;s a song that is bound to set your taint vibrating at a frequency so itchy that only a farm could offer up a sweeter odour.</p>
<h2>?Cop?</h2>
<p>A song this is, no doubt. No way. More an answer than a song, this tune deals with the questions that a child will face when she growed up to be a big scary stupid idiot man. Too much of too little can cause big pain and men are knowed so well to make a fool&#8217;s meal of even the simplest of concepts so here it is: the costume that you&#8217;ve been lining up to rent for the party where the invitation simply read: ?Come as an idiot.? It may reveal to you it may make you turn inside out with embarrassment when Tucker B&#8217;s peels back the brown, rashy reality from the bottom of your deep wonderous deepness-hood. Get f<strong>*</strong>d.</p>
<h2>?No Lazy Death?</h2>
<p>This is a song about being a SPEED HAWK. A SPEED HAWK is the type of dood who is prone to serious amphetamine misuse and abuse. They end up being overly concerned with what everybody they know is doing and whether or not they are doing it right. Their life is consumed by this. At the same time, for reasons unknown, they do not pay attention to anything that may be happening to themselves.  What is happening is usually total self-annihilation. This one was very easy for us to write (WE ARE WATCHING YOU).</p>
<h2>?Mothers?</h2>
<p>On each record we offer up a paean to our Lord PlayLord. We do this modestly. We know that Lord PlayLord loves children (babies mostly), outrageous parties, threats of violence and bone crushing rock riffs.  With Mothers we tried to get all this within the one song.</p>
<p>Upon release of the record we received a fax from Lord PlayLord&#8217;s offshore-office-home with a simple line drawing (in a very SHAKEY hand) of a penis. From previous fax correspondence, we know this to mean: YES!</p>
<h2>?Pompous?</h2>
<p>Pompous is essentially a ?TOUGH GUY SURVEILLANCE? song. For those readers lucky enough to have not met the Tucker B&#8217;s, allow me to fill you up. The Tuckers, apart from being a fantasy rock outfit ?par excellence?, also offer their services as a TOUGH GUY SURVEILLANCE outfit. This means that for a small fee you can hire the Tucker B&#8217;s to WATCH anyone of your choosing, on your behalf. They promise to do no more than simply watch the person that you have instructed them to watch. Between them, they undertake to watch this person 24 hours a day for as long as you would like them to. They do not do anything other than watch them &#8211; no recording, no notes, no talking and certainly no reporting back to you regarding what they did or didn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>?Pompous? is a song about a particular piece of TOUGH GUY SURVEILLANCE that went horribly wrong. One of the Tucker B&#8217;s threw away the rulebook (!) and threatened to steal (WAH!) a television and some children because they became TOO CLOSE to the individual they were supposed to be WATCHING. Pompous is a song dripping in SHAME.</p>
<h2>?Burd Surgeon?</h2>
<p>At one stage during the making of this record, all of the Tucker B&#8217;s lived very close to each other. This meant that every Sunday morning, we could (((((ACID-WALK))))). Mr. Mattfhew Blockmon [aka drummer, Matt Blackman] would arrive very early every Sunday morning with a handful of blotters and the Tucker B&#8217;s would go for a little walk. We would look for little dead birds in the streets of Erskineville, singing the ?Burd Surgeon? ?doo doop? refrain whenever we saw one. By the end of that summer we were Acid Lords and Burd Surgeons all rolled into one furry little package and this song was done.</p>
<h2>?Heatty?</h2>
<p>This song has no words, which is why it&#8217;s called ?Heatty?. With this little piece of puff we were attempting to recreate the party-mood often found inside a K-Mart-bought two-man tent or a beige* 1979 Toyota Corona [sic] after a good and proper dutching, complete with a healthy splattering of nangs on the floor. The closer you get to achieving this modern day enlightenment status, the closer you will be to appreciating the SHARED BAND GOALS for this song.</p>
<p>*Beige is ackshully a very pale brown colour with a tinge of yellow or pink. YUCK!</p>
