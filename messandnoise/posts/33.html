</h3>

Matt (Singing + Guitar): Chuck us a squeaker. </p>
<p>(Squeak) </p>
<p>Houston (Bass): People are gonna wanna kill us.<br/>
Reid (Drums): I say we do that for a whole hour. </p>
<p><strong>Hows the tour going?</strong></p>
<p>M: Tours goin fuggin good, mate. <br/>
R: Peabody is a really good band. <br/>
M: What bizness is it of yours, mate? </p>
<p>(Squeak) </p>
<p>M: FUCK OFF! <br/>
R: Weve been playing gigs now for about 10 years and &#8230; <br/>
M: The name Tucker Bs comes from an old woman, with a very large (squeak). <br/>
R: Yesterday was the first time the band ever sounded like a band. <br/>
M: We have a new cd coming out soon its called CHUBBY! Our influences &#8230; are people. Bouncers covered in tattoos. <br/>
R: Taxi drivers. <br/>
H: Fat people and invoices. </p>
<p><strong>Are Peabody good to travel with?</strong></p>
<p>H: Fucked. <br/>
M: Fucked. <br/>
R: Bunch of cunts. <br/>
M: All that I hear is their voice, basically. <br/>
R: Bruno just does not shut up. <br/>
M: The band is fucken good and theyre quality. <br/>
H: Theyre a great band, but as individuals theyre the most flawed fucken people Ive ever met in my life. <br/>
R: Greames got some kind of complex where he just has to be really friendly. <br/>
H: Its basically like being on holiday with a bunch of sweaty rapists. <br/>
M: Anal rapists? Have you ever been anally raped? </p>
<p>(Squeak) </p>
<p><strong>What was the show in Geelong like last night?</strong></p>
<p>M: Lets put it this way &#8230; everything has a hole (Squeak) see that? </p>
<p>(Squeak Squeak Squeak Squeak Squeak Squeak) </p>
<p>R: How good does that sound?! <br/>
H: After the gig both the drummers from both bands, the Tucker Bs and Peabody, got punched in the fucking head. <br/>
R: Im telling all the other drummers in Australia to never play in Geelong. <br/>
M: But apart from worrying about their physical conditions we had a fucken good time watching. </p>
<p><strong>Was that at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>M: Yeah, same time. Boom. Instantly. Fat lips. </p>
<p><strong>Is that because they were talking the same shit?</strong></p>
<p>M: Ahhhhh, thats a fair comment, fair comment. <br/>
R: We were smiling like happy attentive people to the rest of the world. Obviously we were targets. <br/>
M: Fair comment. <br/>
R: To some stupid bogan redneck cunt. <br/>
M: Well, Reid may have said something along the lines of Youre all cunts. <br/>
R: Gary Ablett is a fucking dickhead! </p>
<p><strong>So on this tour and with your new album about to come out, is it annoying playing new songs when they havent been released yet?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nuh, doesnt make any difference, were already playing new songs that arent even recorded. <br/>
M: When pretty much the entire audience hates ya &#8230; <br/>
H: Most things are annoying. <br/>
M: Doesnt matter if you played Love me Tender. <br/>
R: Tall, short. <br/>
M: Or your latest hit. <br/>
R: Fat, skinny. <br/>
M: You end up coming out looking like a cunt, you know what I mean? <br/>
R: They dont care, they hate you. </p>
<p><strong>So no ones liked you?</strong> </p>
<p>M: Lets just say that everything has a hole! <br/>
H: We havent actually noticed anyone liking us yet. <br/>
M: No, there have been a couple of people that said &#8230; nice things after stuff. <br/>
H: Like, Are you guys going to pack up now? <br/>
R: When you did that cover version &#8230; we could relate to it. <br/>
M: Like, Before you started playing I was really enjoying myself. <br/>
H: And, I think &#8230; I think I can still enjoy myself. <br/>
M: Now that youve finished playing. </p>
<p><strong>Where are your costumes?</strong> </p>
<p>M: Were in the middle of designing a brand new range of stage wear. That we will market as Playlord accessories and bikinis. </p>
<p>(Squeak) </p>
<p>M: For girls. <br/>
R: And Tucker boys. </p>
<p><strong>Are they going to involve lights again?</strong> </p>
<p>M: Its going to involve batteries. <br/>
R: And Darren. <br/>
M: Darren has a very large soldering iron, let me just say that. And plenty of solder. </p>
<p><strong>Since hes not here, lets make the interview about (absent guitarist) Darren.</strong> </p>
<p>H: Well, he never got any sunlight until he was seven. <br/>
M: He never knew what love was until he joined the Tucker Bs. <br/>
H: We had to explain and show Darren. <br/>
R: What love was. </p>
<p><strong>What was his reaction?</strong> </p>
<p>M: Well, his reaction was, A Starpicket. You want me to love a Starpicket? <br/>
R: Its got to start somewhere, Darren. <br/>
M: But you cant start with everything, dude. <br/>
H: So, the first two years of Darren in the band was him and his Starpicket and us just going Love it! <br/>
M: And then he thought the worst was over when Starpicket finished &#8230; and then he was confronted with Sand Paper! <br/>
H: And that was a year. Then it was like, Darren wheres your sandpaper? <br/>
M: And so &#8230; that man knows how to love now. Hes partially psychotic. <br/>
H: Hes prone to psychosis. <br/>
M: Its not that he doesnt talk because he doesnt have much to say. Hes got a lot to fucking say. But he generally writes it down. <br/>
R: And reads it out to himself. IM NOT HAPPY! <br/>
M: On the way down to Melbourne Darren wrote a fucken book. <br/>
H: Called NOT HAPPY. <br/>
R: Called RUDAS RUDAS NOT HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY CUT SHIT! WHY NEW DRUMMER question mark. </p>
<p>(Squeak Squeak Squeak Squeak) </p>
<p>H: I cant wait to get up and play our first song! <br/>
R: With the doggies. <br/>
M: Houston can I just say for the record &#8230; that Ive never smelled worse feet. <br/>
H: Im sorry. <br/>
R: Converse All-Stars are meant to be All Star and you have dirtied those &#8230; <br/>
H: Well, Im not the only one, but for some reason Im being singled out because Im the most open and honest about my problems always. Im an open book. </p>
<p><strong>When does this next album come out and why is it better than (first album, and before 2002s Bish Bosh II: The Bosh Bosh) &#8230; Arm a Drunk?</strong> </p>
<p>M: Who told you that? <br/>
R: Its not actually that good.<br/> <br/>
M: Its coming out October 3rd. And Ill tell you why its fucking better &#8230; <br/>
R: Its a retrospective. <br/>
M: The album is so chock-a-bloc full of love, that it will make you feel &#8230; <br/>
H: Modest. <br/>
M: It will make you hard. It will make you hard. It will make you stand up. <br/>
H: With modesty. <br/>
M: With modesty. <br/>
H: And just be ready to love more. <br/>
M: It will make you stand up in shame. <br/>
R: Youll pitch a tent. <br/>
M: You will look down across your valley, and you will think SHAME. <br/>
H: SHAME I NEED TO LOVE MORE! And thats why its going to be a big <br/>seller.<br/>
R: Thats why the albums called Chubby. <br/>
M: Because people are shameful. </p>
<p><strong>Its a political album &#8230;</strong> </p>
<p>H: No. <br/>
M: Its an album about commitment and shame. </p>
<p><strong>A commitment to shame.</strong> </p>
<p>M: Lets start this interview again with the basis that its all about the commitment to shame. <br/>
H: Were not ashamed of the album. <br/>
M: Just the people we have to give it to. <br/>
H: This ones better. You can hear the singing. <br/>
R: Its quite commercial. <br/>
H: We know our target market now. <br/>
M: Theres more or less thought put into it. <br/>
H: Theres more or less ideas in there. And theres more or less effort. And its more or less polished. <br/>
R: Less effort, but more polish. But the next record will be even better. </p>
<p><strong>(To Reid) Drumming-wise?</strong> </p>
<p>R: Not just drumming-wise. Everywhere. Better singing, better guitar &#8230; <br/>
M: Were talking everywhere. South America, Europe &#8230; everywhere. <br/>
R: Keyboards, dog-noises &#8230; <br/>
M: Everything&#8217;s got a hole. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
