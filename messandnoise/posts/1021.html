                <h3>The Community Chest&#8217;s debut album ?Top of the Hour? sees the Perth band draw on car accidents, bushwalking, university, a $500 synth and the drummer of Dinosaur Jr. Or so says frontman <strong>ADEM K</strong> (ex-Turnstyle), who&#8217;s in the midst of making a video for every track.

<h2>?Show Me?  </h2>
<p>This song&#8217;s journey was about as far removed from a singer/songwriter approach as possible. I will try to summarise. One day I found myself jamming with Murph from Dinosaur Jr. in our practice room. Out came the song&#8217;s main riff. At around the same time I watched the film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827">Monsters</a></em> and fantasised about Mexico and seducing a Mexican using Google Translate. I then found myself in a hotel room after a Weird Al concert and wrote the chorus with some able-bodied yet highly tequilarised souls. I then brought the song to The Community Chest and it all came together. Most of the original elements remained, including the shouted Spanish seduction and the ?Kokomo? steal ?We&#8217;ll get there fast and then we&#8217;ll take it slow.?</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Wave Rock?  </h2>
<p>This was the first song conceived and recorded and was pretty much an exercise in short, bombastic synth-rock. The middle eight originally had a guitar solo that was scrapped for the ?ba ba ba? vocals &#8211; I guess I was listening to a lot of chillwave. The day after I attended a Go Team gig, I added the handclaps in the final verse. The lyrics are nothing special &#8211; I thought I would try and quell some family bickering but changed my mind at the last second. I like the line ?In the cold, climate riot.? I had it in a notebook for years and never used it but it seemed to suit the situation and motivation.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Cyclops Extreme?  </h2>
<p> I guess this one has a blues-ish swing compared to the other songs on the record. I love the way the drums sound. This was written and recorded very quickly by pretty much just Trevor [Cotton, drums] and myself. Pete [Yuncken, synths] is an accomplished brass player and he layered the dirty horns toward the end of the sessions for the album. There is some vitriol here. I work at a university and there are a lot of people who have never left university and therefore have rarely any concept of the real world &#8211; a minor issue becomes a tsunami of Aceh proportions. So I guess Cyclops could mean ?tunnel vision? or ?one-eyed-ness?.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Car C?  </h2>
<p>I was driving toward the city. I was about 19 years old. I had David Bowie&#8217;s <em>Best Of</em> on really loud. Suffice to say I wasn&#8217;t paying attention. I rammed right up the rear end of a Hyundai Excel driven by a pretty young thing merely days after she received it as an 18th birthday gift. When I went to the police station to fill out a report, I was told to illustrate the incident in diagrammatic form. I was to be Car A, the girl in the Hyundai was Car B. I went one step further. I also added Car C, in front of Car B, turning without indicating. Now the whole accident was Car C&#8217;s fault, not mine. Strange thing was Car B&#8217;s report made no mention of Car C and this lack of collusion resulted in a whopping fine. I wrote this song with Grandaddy in mind, and I think it still retains some of that inspiration. I love the interplay between Dee [Kerimoski, vocals and percussion] and Trevor&#8217;s drums and Dee&#8217;s sweet octave harmonies. I can&#8217;t take all the credit though; it was actually an unfinished Turnstyle song from 2000.</p>

<h2>?Top of the Hour Pt. 1?</h2>
<p>A simple kiss-off to my past life, wasting a good part of the 2000s trying to be a ?60s-inspired pop star and not who I truly was. Check out my drivers license photo from 2006! 49 seconds is all it took. It&#8217;s great fun to play though.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Blassphemy?  </h2>
<p>Yes, double ?s?. The song is inspired by my friend Robert Blass. In his late 20s he led an amazing jetset lifestyle being part of an affluent Bondi family with connections. A gifted musician, he fled to Los Angeles in the late ?70s with a bunch of miscreants to form a British Invasion cover band, complete with Scouse accents. The Americans loved that stuff. He found himself dating ex-Miss Australia, invited to parties featuring famous film stars and at least one very famous and very drunk Liverpudlian drummer. When the covers work dried up he kissed goodbye to LA by throwing a handful of cannabis seeds from the Hollywood sign and flew to London. Here he worked in real estate &#8211; arranging temporary housing for actors, writers and directors. His first clients were Steven Spielberg and Philip Kaufman, writing <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> reportedly amidst a haze of coke and pot. During this haze, Blass went above and beyond &#8211; keeping Kaufman&#8217;s wife ?occupied?. But enough from me, the story&#8217;s in the song.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Same Time, Same Channel?  </h2>
<p>A couple of riffs I had for years, glued together and embellished by the band. Looking for a song that I could encourage Dee to sing , this one took the cake &#8211; it was perfect for her register and I couldn&#8217;t play the syncopated chords and sing at the same time. The song needed a lot of work in post-production as the tape machine was playing up and the kick drum became less audible as the song went along. In fact the whole recording was dulling out as it went. It took some surgery from Laurie [Sinagra, bass and production] to salvage and turn into one of the album&#8217;s highlights. Lyrically, it&#8217;s a nonsensical rant about my disdain for television and a ?couch potato? lifestyle.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Get Into the Rocket?  </h2>
<p>I felt like all I was doing for a long time was playing chord after chord after chord, so I wanted to write a song with a bit more riffage. The band really came together on this one. I love the synths through this and the vocoder vocals towards the end. Dee and I have always been fans of call-and-response and we sort of went for it on this track.  The double-time intro and bridge was once a totally separate song in the <a href="/articles/3677409">Tucker B&#8217;s</a> style. Again, not my strongest lyrics &#8211; allusions to space, fatigue, sleep, etc. &#8211; but a smooth, dreamy vibe all-round. When we do this song live we have a slowed-down Sabbath-y ending to it, but it got cut from the mix in favour of a more succinct approach. </p>

<p/>
<h2>?Stipe Crustacea Patch?</h2>
<p>I started this song on my own (I play all the instruments on it except drums) and, rightfully and selfishly so, it is my favourite. It&#8217;s not to say the band weren&#8217;t involved. The mixing session for this track, like most, featured the whole band putting in ideas. We basically remixed the song from a seven-minute drone in one key (A, if you want to play along at home). The title comes from a nickname for a synth patch I created for the song. The lead synth is actually a Casio going through filters and the very little guitar on it is played through a tiny Fender practice amp. Synth-heads will recognize the Korg MS20 bass. The song is essentially about my bushwalking/wine country adventures I regularly partake in with my son. He can be heard in the field recording towards the end of the song. Five years old and he&#8217;s already on a vinyl record.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Youngblood?  </h2>
<p>I had the riff forever. I had the structure for about eight years. I had the vocal melody for two. I tried to sing it but couldn&#8217;t. Dee could, and she could also harmonise with herself. This song would have laid dormant for another eight years if she and the band didn&#8217;t knock it out of the ballpark. I love the phased-out middle eight (Laurie&#8217;s idea) and we got to put the old Roland SH-2000 on this track, which pleased me greatly because it cost me $500. The lyrics were purely improvised when I wrote them and I like how the melody has no relation to what the instruments are doing. Oh and COWBELL!!</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Anti-Lullaby?  </h2>
<p>I found a scratchy demo of this when I was trawling for new material. Paul <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=uc2UEfWjvo8">Fanning], my song partner in Turnstyle, had no recollection of the track but it&#8217;s clearly our two voices on it. I fleshed it out and recorded it in much the same way as ?Stipe Crustacea Patch?. I hit a brick wall, showed it to the band and we then breathed some life into it. I think it&#8217;s Laurie&#8217;s favourite. Pete was very instrumental in the arrangement of this track and I love Trevor&#8217;s drums &#8211; all three of them. It&#8217;s a bitch to play though, as the Pro Tools edit window will attest to, and getting the live version down for the album launch is making me sweat more than [Inner Circle</a>.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Top of the Hour Pt. 2?  </h2>
<p>A kiss-off to the post-rock past I never had. It was actually a fast, jolly bop of a song until Laurie slowed it down and added a ton of reverb to it. The ears of pretentious post-rock beard strokers everywhere will prick at the song&#8217;s low bpms forcing them to conclude: ?It&#8217;s a slow instrumental. Man these guys are deep.? Until they hear ?Wave Rock?.</p>

<p>####?Top of the Hour? comes out <a href="http://thecommunitychest.bandcamp.com">today</a> digitally and on coloured vinyl through Gun Fever. It launches tomorrow (July 13) at The Rosemount in Perth with The Ghost Hotel, Flower Drums, Braves and The Ten Bit Band.</p>
