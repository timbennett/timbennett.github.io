                <h3><strong>STEPH KRETOWICZ</strong> tries to get to the bottom of guarded Melbourne/Sydney trio Bushwalking.

<p>Bushwalking don&#8217;t like to talk about their music. If it&#8217;s not drummer Nisa Venerosa responding to an email with ?not aloud [sic] to talk about song lyrics/titles!!!!?, it&#8217;s bassist Ela Stiles declining to reveal which songs were hers before her solo project became a three-piece:</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know. Do I have to reveal that?</em><br/>
<em>You don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to.</em><br/>
<em>OK, I won&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Karl Scullin and his deafening silence after being applied to via an email address I&#8217;m warned he probably won&#8217;t reply to. This might sound like the band &#8211; consisting members of Songs, Fabulous Diamonds and KES &#8211; are being actively difficult. More likely it&#8217;s a musical endeavour that follows far too intimate a process to be explained away through stock press responses or critical abstractions. Instead, a reserved Ela is more interested in talking about an unrelated trip to India she&#8217;s taking with Nisa, or the pros and cons of collecting the dole. But when it comes to discussing the specifics of debut LP <em><a href="/releases/2001072">First Time</a></em>, out in a limited run on Atlanta label Army of Bad Luck, then you&#8217;re on your own.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3030881/440x457-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Can you tell me a bit about how the band started?</strong><br/>
It originally started a few years ago. I met Karl in Melbourne because I was playing a show with my other band Songs. We just started talking and I wanted to record and he kind of said he&#8217;d be interested in helping me out. We just started doing stuff and Karl thought it would be good to ask Nisa if she wanted to help out. Then we recorded a few songs and decided to become a real band.</p>
<p><strong>Were you originally called Zsa Zsa before or after you became a band?</strong><br/>
We were called Zsa Zsa for a little but then we all decide that the name wasn&#8217;t right for us. We even played a few show as Zsa Zsa before we decided that we should change it.</p>
<p><strong>Who writes the lyrics?</strong><br/>
We all do.</p>
<p><strong>There were a few songs on <em>First Time*</em> that were written earlier though, right?</strong><br/>
Yeah, that&#8217;s right. A few of them were mine to begin with because I originally wanted to do a solo album but then it turned into this band. We started collaborating on the second half of the album, I guess. </p>
<p><strong>How did Josh Fauver of [US label] Army of Bad Luck end up putting you out?</strong><br/>
My other band Songs toured with Deerhunter a few years ago and we just became friends. Josh just said, ?I&#8217;d love to hear any demos that you&#8217;ve done?, because I said I wanted to do something else. So I sent him the album when it was nearly finished and he was excited to put it out. He&#8217;s been pretty amazing since then and he&#8217;s done everything for us.</p>
<p><strong>Do you hear a difference between the music you&#8217;re putting out and the other stuff on the label?</strong><br/>
I haven&#8217;t heard that much of his stuff but I think, yeah. we are quite different to the other stuff. I feel like we&#8217;re less &#8211; punky? I don&#8217;t know. That sounds dumb. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3030883/400x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>That&#8217;s totally what I meant. What about the artwork? I interpreted the blue eye shadow as some sort of reference to our generational experience. Blue eye shadow was a big thing when I was in high school.</strong><br/>
Yeah. It&#8217;s funny how people read into everything. A lot of people have been saying it&#8217;s a real teenage ?coming of age? theme, or something and then other people say it&#8217;s really sexual. You just said that about the blue eye shadow, which I didn&#8217;t think about but it&#8217;s quite funny to hear other people&#8217;s perceptions. </p>
<p><strong>I wasn&#8217;t necessarily implying it would have been conscious.</strong><br/>
No, that&#8217;s just another element. It&#8217;s good. </p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re not singing from some sort of coming of age point of view, do you then find it insulting that people are basically insinuating that you&#8217;re really juvenile?</strong><br/>
Oh, I have no doubt that we&#8217;re really juvenile but it wasn&#8217;t intentional.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re currently split between states. Are you staying in Sydney? No plans to move to Melbourne?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d love to move to Melbourne but my whole life&#8217;s here. I&#8217;ve got a really good job and all that stuff. And Songs. I can&#8217;t abandon them, just yet. [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p><strong>So I imagine you&#8217;re more productive when you&#8217;re together, as a result of being apart?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s true. We seem to make it work really well when I go down for three days, for instance. This weekend we got so many songs. We worked out a lot of stuff and made a lot of progress. </p>
<p>I think you take it for granted when you live in the same city and jam for a few hours here and there. But when you&#8217;re intensely practicing because you know you don&#8217;t have much time, it&#8217;s very productive. We don&#8217;t really leave the house very much. I think it&#8217;s a really great way of working, strangely enough. You&#8217;d think it would hinder us. I guess we can play shows to get my airfares. </p>
<p><strong>Did Karl produce the record?</strong><br/>
No. I think we all kind of produced it. Karl has lots of good ideas and he&#8217;s quite good at the recording process and mixing. But I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a funny one because it started out as something different to what it ended up. </p>
<p><strong>In what sense?</strong><br/>
Oh, well, it was my thing and was basically finished. Then Karl added some ideas, obviously, and then with Nisa drumming, it&#8217;s going to have a different sound because she&#8217;s got such a distinctive drumming style. Then we just kind of became a real band, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Were you inexperienced on bass when you started playing with Songs?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d never played bass when I started with Songs. I was 19 and I&#8217;d never played in a band. I did play guitar a little bit but I was kind of pushed onto bass [<em>laughs</em>] and I ended up really enjoying it. I still play guitar every now and then but I think I&#8217;m better at playing bass.</p>
<p><strong>I was reading that Songs interview in <em>Mountain Fold</em> and, it was either [bandmates] Jeff [Burch] or Max [Doyle] who said?</strong><br/>
Oh, Max said that I was a shit guitarist? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Well, yeah, he did say that but I wasn&#8217;t going to bring that up?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>Were you aware of his feelings about your guitar playing at that point?</strong><br/>
Oh, I wasn&#8217;t that great. I didn&#8217;t even think he was that great. He&#8217;s still not that great. This is my chance to say that Max is not amazing. [<em>Laughs</em>] He&#8217;s got his own style. </p>
<p><strong>So you would have developed your own style because you&#8217;d approached it from a naive perspective.</strong><br/>
I think I&#8217;ve always been better at singing than anything else. </p>
<p><strong>But then Nisa was also self-taught through with Fabulous Diamonds.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s the same kind of thing, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>What I was going to say about that interview was that someone [Max] made a good point, that the success of a band isn&#8217;t dependent on how well everyone plays but on their chemistry.</strong><br/>
Yeah. I think we all do what we can do in Bushwalking, which I think is a cool way to be. I don&#8217;t particularly like people who can sing, like, in the classic sense; you know, really trained singers. I hate that. I just think working it out for your self a lot of the time gives people a really individual style.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. The way I think about Bushwalking is that it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re doing something that has never been done before but it&#8217;s being delivered in a way that&#8217;s totally unique.</strong><br/>
I think that&#8217;s a good thing to aim for. It&#8217;s a good way to think, to be trying different things. Just trying to do something that&#8217;s a bit more interesting than lots of stuff that&#8217;s around.</p>
