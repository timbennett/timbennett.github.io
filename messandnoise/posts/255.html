                <h3>The Cheats? Julian Tovey and Tom Cooper met on-stage while wearing animal suits at the Flaming Lips? performance at the 2004 Big Day Out. They&#8217;ve since been guns for hire for defunct Melbourne outfits Riff Random and Shooting at Unarmed Men, and are about to release an album of their own &#8211; &#8216;Hats Off To The Cheats&#8217; &#8211; through Off The Hip. On the eve of the album&#8217;s launch, Tovey talks to <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> about detours, debuts and unexpected delays.

<strong>There&#8217;s obviously an old-school sound to the record. It even opens with, ?C&#8217;mon baby, let&#8217;s do the twist.? Was it intentional to kick off the record with such a familiar refrain?</strong><br/>
I guess in a way. That was one of our older songs, ?Do It Again.? When we first started, we just wanted to do straight-up party rock&#8217;n?roll. We were listening to a lot of Little Richard and Chuck Berry, so we [wanted to] keep it simple; just catchy, three or four chords, lots of energy. I don&#8217;t know why we choose that one to go at the start of the record. I think we just like the start of the song: the drum beat and the ?hey? chant. We didn&#8217;t give a lot of consideration to the lyrics until after, and a few people have commented on it. It wasn&#8217;t a grand statement of intent or anything.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s also a real cheekiness to the title of ?Baby Won&#8217;t You Be My Baby (Tonight)?.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I guess that&#8217;s the companion piece to ?Do It Again?. There&#8217;s a similar sort of vibe. We used to do a cover of ?Long Tall Sally? by Little Richard. We dropped that out of the set and began to miss it, and instead of doing another cover or playing it again, I thought, ?Let&#8217;s try doing something in a similar vein, just a straight-up party rock song with a very simple message and catchy chorus.? Why do a cover when we could write one of our own? And ?Tonight? is a Spinal Tap reference: ?Tonight I&#8217;m gonna rock you tonight.? (<em>Laughs</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Do you think people have forgotten just how raw those old Little Richard and Chuck Berry records are?</strong><br/>
Yeah. We love that really unhinged vibe a lot of those old records have, like people just letting rip. Obviously I don&#8217;t have the vocal chops of Little Richard, but I sort of go as far as I can with my voice. When we&#8217;re tracking the guitar and drums, we try to keep it really live. We just do three or four takes and pick the best one. So there&#8217;s mistakes on some of the solos and a few slips on the drums, but we just wanted keep that really raw edge and maintain the energy.</p>
<p><strong>?One Foot in the Grave? seems to be about the wearing nature of the rock&#8217;n?roll lifestyle. Was that inspired by your experiences in bands?</strong><br/>
Not necessarily. I guess [it was] inspired by seeing some of the older generation of rockers around Melbourne really. Not my own experience but just playing with certain guys who push themselves to the edge for their art. These guys are like 50, or in their 50s, and they&#8217;re doing all kinds of drugs and staying up really late. They still put on really good shows but you can see it&#8217;s taken its toll.</p>
<p><strong>?Worried About You? is a bit of a country detour from the rest of the album. Do you have other songs like that or is it an anomaly?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s an anomaly. We&#8217;ve got one new song we&#8217;re working on &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have lyrics yet &#8211; in the same vein. I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s gonna be our new direction or anything [<em>laughs</em>]. Songs like that are good to pop up from time to time. It breaks up the album so it&#8217;s not full-on, flat-out all the way through. And also in the [live] set, being only two of us, we&#8217;re always really busy pushing ourselves physically, so it&#8217;s nice to have a bit of a breather if we want to throw it in.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s like the requisite ballad.</strong><br/>
I mean, it&#8217;s still up tempo, but it&#8217;s definitely down a few notches from our normal setting.</p>
<p><strong>Do you try to keep the songs as short as you can? The single ?Burn It Up? is barely more than two minutes long.</strong><br/>
We do keep them short, if for no other reason than we want to move on. Once you&#8217;ve heard the chorus two or three times, unless there&#8217;s other parts, I think you&#8217;re just dragging it out a bit unnecessarily. Particularly with our sort of music, you lose the energy if you do the same bit over and over again. So we get the point across and have fun while we do it and move on to the next one.</p>
<p><strong>The Cheats have been around for a few years and yet this is your debut album. Does it feel like it&#8217;s been a long time coming?</strong><br/>
Yeah, a very long time coming. We&#8217;ve been around four years now. We started writing songs from the beginning and some have fallen by the wayside. We&#8217;ve got some more recent ones [on the album]. We did a session at the tail end of the album, which in our eyes is the only advantage of it taking so long; we had a couple of extra good tracks to throw on. </p>
<blockquote><p>?You lose the energy if you do the same bit over and over again. So we get the point across and have fun while we do it and move on to the next one.?</p></blockquote>
<p>We got kind of sidetracked with Shooting At Unarmed Men for a while. Jon Chapple was out here at the time on a short visa. That was going well and we were writing a lot of songs with him. We [wanted] to get the album with Shooting At Unarmed Men finished before he [had] to go away, and we were quite busy that summer doing a lot of gigs. And then we were unhappy with how that album [<em>Triptych</em>] turned out, so we quit the band and then didn&#8217;t really start thinking about the Cheats album until that had finished. We were recording it on mate&#8217;s rates with our friend Robbie [Adams] and then Ash [Oswald], who did the artwork, was helping us out. All these people are very talented but they&#8217;re very busy, and when they&#8217;re cutting you a break, you try not to put too many demands on their time. We just wanted to put out something we were happy with and could make within our budget, so it took as long as it did. But we&#8217;re pleased with it now.</p>
<p><strong>Why weren&#8217;t you happy with the Shooting At Unarmed Men album?</strong><br/>
Just the way it sounded and the way it was packaged over three discs. We really dug the songs on the album. We were really proud of the songs we wrote and we loved the gigs we played with the band.</p>
<p><strong>When exactly did you two leave that band?</strong><br/>
It was about two years ago. We left and he got some new guys in [Chris Drane and Patrick Walker] and then made another record since then.</p>
<p><strong>You guys had two songs featured on <em>Underbelly</em>?</strong><br/>
Yeah. We had a song on the first series twice and one song on the second series.</p>
<p><strong>How did that happen?</strong><br/>
The people who source the music do a lot of indie rock stuff and they just contacted us. We didn&#8217;t have any idea it was going to be the new big TV show or anything. So they put us in a couple fight scenes and I think one car chase. It was cool.</p>
<p><strong>Have you noticed that bringing new people to the band?</strong><br/>
?I&#8217;ve had a few people contact us on MySpace saying they heard it on <em>Underbelly</em>, but I&#8217;m not sure how much attention the average commercial TV viewer pays to a garage rock from Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a tour planned for after the album launch?</strong><br/>
Well, we&#8217;ve got a few more shows in Melbourne. We&#8217;re doing one of our Pony late shows, which are always unbelievably fun, at 2am on a Saturday [June 27]. It&#8217;s a great size room and people are always up for it at that hour. It usually gets a bit crazy, which is fun. We&#8217;re hoping to go to Sydney in August, and we&#8217;ll probably get to Queensland at some stage this year too. But that&#8217;s about as far ahead as we&#8217;ve thought.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>The Cheats will launch their debut album, <em>Hats Off To The Cheats</em>, on June 6 at Yah Yah&#8217;s in Melbourne.</p>
