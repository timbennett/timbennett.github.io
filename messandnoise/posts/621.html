<h2>?Walls?</h2>

Can you picture one of those nice Californian Bungalows in the suburbs? You know the ones &#8211; the rosebushes are perfectly manicured, and inside it&#8217;s all dark wood panelling and pink velvet curtains. I spent a year there, being forever paranoid that I&#8217;d scratch the polished floorboards while moving an amp or something, and always on my hands and knees scrubbing at some stain. Eventually the walls began inching inwards, like the house was eating me. I began to hate being inside, and when I got home from work I&#8217;d stand on the doorstep and fix the house with this defiant stare, telling it not to fuck with me. Pretty stupid.<br/>
I&#8217;d have to befriend the house sooner or later. So I did. But I knew that the minute someone I disliked walked through the door they&#8217;d burst into flames, as if the house were Drew Barrymore in <em>Firestarter</em>.</p>

<h2>?Unfamiliar Skirts?</h2>
<p>This is a nasty and vindictive song. A lady is pissed off because her lover leaves her, so she curses him. She basically tells him, ?Go on and leave, but you&#8217;ll never find happiness. You&#8217;ll search for it all over the world; you&#8217;ll search for it between the legs of all these strange women. But you&#8217;ll never find it, because I am the only one who can make you happy. And once you realise that, it will be too late.? See? Rotten to the core.</p>

<h2>?Rot On The Vine?</h2>
<p>The man has hair so long it coils around his girlfriend&#8217;s ankles to stop her leaving. He also has a head full of dark thoughts that leak out of his head and get all over everything, like ink out of a security tag when you shoplift a sweater. The girlfriend leaves him anyway because she&#8217;s shrivelling like a month-old grape.</p>
<p>During the recording I decided I hated the middle section and I tried to take it out but Simon [Grounds] flat-out refused to let me. I think it&#8217;s the only song we had any major disagreements over. He was right though, of course. We tried all sorts of things to make the part sound different: I spent several hours whacking an old Roland Hand Clapper with a drum stick, but in the end we kept it with just a shaker, and the song is better for it.</p>
<p>[Drummer] Steve Masterson really shines on this track. It&#8217;s one of the few on the album where there is no drum machine, and he gets to actually play the whole kit, God bless him. Steve&#8217;s drums at the end and Marc [Regueiro-McKelvie&#8217;s] guitar make for one of my favourite moments on the record, but it is hard to re-create live without a real drummer. Patrick Millman deserves credit for the bass line and I would have used his fills too, except I couldn&#8217;t play them.</p>

<h2>?Sad Sun?</h2>
<p>A lady gets kidnapped in a beautiful mountainous land by some friendly sloths, who make her the Sloth Queen before carrying her around and doing a weird sloth dance. At least that&#8217;s what Lucy Dyson deduced when she made the video, and I&#8217;m happy to go with that. </p>

<p/>
<p>One of the comments on <em>M+N</em> was, ?I like the old version better?, and I&#8217;m anticipating hearing this a few more times. The old version is floating around somewhere (you can find it on the <a href="/news/4104826">Clones and Clones compilation</a> for one) but it just wasn&#8217;t ever going to fit on this record. We recorded it when Teeth &amp; Tongue was operating like a four-piece rock band and it&#8217;s faster and noisier than this one; here we take it back to its original speed and mood, with the live drums just kicking in for the second half.</p>
<p>I initially wrote the song using drum samples on a clapped-out version of Nuendo, with a nylon guitar fed through a Guitar Rig octave pedal instead of a bass. That&#8217;s because at the time I lived in a warehouse in Brunswick with eight people and paper-thin walls. Everybody could hear everybody else having sex, which was awkward but we learnt to keep the noise down.</p>
<p>The song never really found its feet until Marc came along and added that epic pill-kicking-in-as-the-sun-comes-up-at-the-outdoor-doof-party guitar part, though.</p>

<h2>?Love As A Word?</h2>
<p>I really love the last Crayon Fields album <em><a href="/releases/2000417">All The Pleasures of the World</a></em> and I think I was trying to harness some of that slippery, slinky percussive vibe they&#8217;ve got going on. The song started as a kind of mediocre strummy thing and probably never would&#8217;ve made it onto the record if I hadn&#8217;t added the porn movie bass line. It&#8217;s also the only song where I let myself use daggy African percussion samples, breaking my strict 505-only rule. I&#8217;m pretty sure Geoff O&#8217;Connor would be appalled to know that he inspired a quasi-African porn homage, but there you go.</p>

<h2>?Happiness?</h2>
<p>One of my day jobs involved making sandwiches in the back room of a cafe. It was a good time to switch on Radio National and listen to <em>Life Matters</em> or the architecture program, and learn all sorts of things to make me sound more intelligent at dinner parties. One morning a guest on the program was talking about how there&#8217;s all this pressure to be happy and we think there&#8217;s something wrong with us if we&#8217;re not. The idea that happiness is elusive and overrated stuck with me for some reason. It&#8217;s a pretty happy song, like most of mine.</p>

<h2>?Vaseline On The Lens?</h2>
<p>I worked at a rehearsal studio for several years. The studio had recycling bins in all the rooms but bands would get too pissed and not use them. At the end of the night I would rummage through the rubbish, sifting through Hungry Jacks wrappers, cold chips and ciggie butts to fish out the glass bottles. Of course while I was at work I would daydream about more glamorous and more romantic things, and the scenes of these daydreams had a lovely blurry look to them.</p>
<p>We recorded the song four times over the course of two years, before this version ended up on Tambourine. I know at least two people who don&#8217;t think we nailed it but I reckon we got close. In earlier versions Marc is playing this crazy grinding guitar part at the beginning, and he took it out to make it less muddy and to give the track a slow-burn, brooding quality. Some people have told us off for that. Marc&#8217;s got some pretty sweet face-scraping guitar parts in this one though, which I think more than makes up for it.</p>

<h2>?Release Your Burden?</h2>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read the Bible yet but I intend to one day. I am imagining that in one of the stories Jesus turns up on someone&#8217;s doorstep having just fallen in the river. I think that if it happened to be your doorstep, you&#8217;d probably give him (and maybe all his disciples) a towel, regardless of whether you thought he should go on and miracle-up his own towel out of a piece of bread or a broken sandal. </p>
<p>Anyway, this song isn&#8217;t really about Jesus at all. It&#8217;s kind of about letting go of all your expectations, and kind of about giving up. But in a good way. And despite the line, ?Things will never be OK?, it isn&#8217;t as pessimistic as you&#8217;d think.</p>

<h2>?To Be Alone?</h2>
<p>But this one is pessimistic. As downer as they come, really. Put in on and weep dramatically into your cask Lambrusco and when the big, slow drums kick in for the melodramatic outro, stand silhouetted in the window so the whole of High Street can watch you playing slo-mo air guitar. </p>

<h2>?This And More?</h2>
<p>Patrick Millman [Teeth &amp; Tongue&#8217;s previous bassist] needs credit for this one. We wrote it in his dad&#8217;s spare bedroom, among framed Collingwood memorabilia and old <em>Woman&#8217;s Weekly</em> cookbooks. I ended up having to play the bass myself on the recording but I never could quite get the smooth little hammer-ons that Patto did. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never written a song about furniture before but I guess it&#8217;s as good a topic as any. This one is about people who have really nice apartments and go furniture shopping on weekends to buy lots of that 20th century Swedish furniture (or is it Danish?) that&#8217;s so big at the moment, and fill their converted warehouses with ex-industrial knick-knacks and old tram signs. Except I don&#8217;t know why I wrote about that, because when I make a million bucks from this album I&#8217;ll probably do the same.</p>
