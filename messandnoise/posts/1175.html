                <h3>Love Connection guitarist Nathan Burgess made a record with his own band, but it&#8217;s taken three years to finally see the light of day. Interview by <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>. 
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3039128/450x360-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
There&#8217;s always a gap between when a band records an album and when it&#8217;s released, but it&#8217;s not usually three years. Full Ugly, the solo-project-turned-quartet of Melbourne&#8217;s Nathan Burgess, cut <em>Spent the Afternoon</em> with Jack Farley (Beaches, Bitch Prefect) back in mid-2011, but it has only just come out via Bedroom Suck. Why the epic wait? It just took Burgess a long time to find a label, and Bedroom Suck a bit longer to clear a spot in its release schedule. (Although there&#8217;s definitely some solace to be had in the album falling under the label&#8217;s newfound <a href="/news/4638758">international deal</a> with Fire Records.)</p>
<p>The delay puts the album smack in the middle of a saturated guitar-pop scene rather than at its start <a href="/articles/4517534">a few years ago</a>. But the current abundance of jangly guitars and mild-mannered vocals in Australian indie music shouldn&#8217;t put anyone off Full Ugly: the band is steadier than most, exhaling reverb-frosted tunes full of wagging, surf-tinged melodies and plaintive, day-in-the-life lyrics. The songs come into even sharper focus live, with a certain country tug audible in the ones written since <em>Spent the Afternoon</em>, while ?Nervous? and ?Hilly Street? map more frayed emotions.</p>
<p>Burgess used to play guitar in <a href="/search/?q=love+connection">Love Connection</a> before that band&#8217;s leader, Michael Caterer, relocated to New York with bandmate and wife Kobi Simpson &#8211; and Caterer used to play in Full Ugly as well. His move overseas left Burgess to pursue Full Ugly predominately and find a new lead guitarist, eventually recruiting his housemate Nathan McFarlane to join bassist Zach Schneider (Great Outdoors, Totally Mild) and drummer <a href="/articles/4637806">Thomas Mendelovits</a> (Milk Teddy). While the album still sees Caterer playing guitar and Burgess juggling roles since filled by his bandmates, the live band has long been solid and &#8211; unsurprisingly &#8211; now has enough material for a second LP.</p>
<p>Ahead of a launch tour, Burgess started our interview by mentioning that, despite the holdups, he was fairly sure he didn&#8217;t want to self-release the album. </p>
<p><strong>Why didn&#8217;t you want to release it yourself?</strong><br/>
I just figured it&#8217;d be good if someone could put it out and get the word out more than I could. I didn&#8217;t want it to be a nothing [release]. There were many times when I thought I should just self-release it, to get it off my chest, but then just having Joe [Alexander from Bedroom Suck] all the time saying he was gonna do it [helped]. He just needed more time.</p>
<p><strong>It was up on Soundcloud for a while, wasn&#8217;t it?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I chucked it up there and didn&#8217;t really tell anyone, just so people could listen to it if they want. That was just an unmastered version, one of the first mixes we had.</p>
<p><strong>Have you been writing a lot of material since?</strong><br/>
Yeah, we&#8217;ve got pretty much a new album that we wanna record properly pretty soon. So it worked out: the new album is just gonna back up the old album straightaway, pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>Does it feel funny to still be playing these songs and still be tied to them?</strong><br/>
A little bit. I&#8217;ve never actually been sick of the songs, which is a good thing. But at practices it&#8217;s kind of like, ?Ugh, this song again?? A lot of the shows, we&#8217;ve just been playing new stuff and a couple of the old songs. It seems kind of strange going back to the old songs now because we have to launch it. It&#8217;s fun learning them again, ones we haven&#8217;t played for a year or longer.</p>
<p><strong>I really liked what you were playing at the Record Store Day gig.</strong><br/>
That was mainly new stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;m trying to rip anybody off.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Some of it sounded country-ish.</strong><br/>
Yeah, we&#8217;ve had people saying that. I don&#8217;t know, I guess I listen to heaps of Neil Young and Crazy Horse, and people see country in that. But it&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;m trying to rip anybody off. I like that sound and I do listen to country music as well.</p>
<p><strong>It was something I hadn&#8217;t noticed the previous time I saw you, so I thought maybe the new material was going more in that direction.</strong><br/>
No, no. Well, I haven&#8217;t intended to. [<em>Laughs</em>] Maybe there&#8217;s a bit more twang in the guitar I was playing. I&#8217;ve been trying to pull out some lead lines lately, which I&#8217;ve never done in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Has the band had a solid lineup for a while now?</strong><br/>
Well, Michael [Caterer] was in the band originally and then he had to move over to New York because he got a job. I was living with my friend Nathan [McFarlane] at the time and we were playing guitar together. I was like, ?You may as well join,? because he knew the songs. So he&#8217;s been in the band probably two years. It&#8217;s pretty solid. Even with the new songs in comparison to what Michael used to play, it&#8217;s not that different.</p>
<p><strong>So is it Michael playing the lead lines on the album?</strong><br/>
Yeah, in collaboration with what I made up. I showed him quite a bit. ?Cause at the start, Full Ugly was just me, pretty much, on the four-track. I showed the guys the songs and said, ?Play it like this but use your own touch.? A lot of the songs, like ?Drove Down? and ?Hanging Around?, it&#8217;s just all me.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s pretty easy with technology if you want to keep making music with Michael remotely. Have you thought about doing that?</strong><br/>
Not really. We&#8217;re not fast workers anyway, and he&#8217;s pretty busy with his own band <a href="/news/4641227">[Shorts</a>]. And he plays in Scott &amp; Charlene&#8217;s [Wedding] as well. We&#8217;ve joked about it a couple of times, but nothing so far.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I don&#8217;t think I have a beautiful voice or sing like a bird.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>You have a distinctive singing voice. Especially live, it&#8217;s pretty high. Did it take you time to get confident about singing live?</strong><br/>
Not really. I&#8217;m not that confident about my singing voice, but I just go for it. I&#8217;m not trying to impress anyone. I don&#8217;t think I have a beautiful voice or sing like a bird or whatever. [<em>Laughs</em>] I just go for it. When I&#8217;m making a song, I know now if something has to be lower or higher. It took me a while, when I heard my voice back on recordings, to get used to it. I usually just double-track it and it warms it up away.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the first band you&#8217;ve sang lead for?</strong><br/>
Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have many bands before Love Connection?</strong><br/>
No. [Just] early high-school bands. [This] has been my thing for years. I&#8217;ve always just called it Full Ugly, from like eight years ago, when I was trying to write songs.</p>
<p><strong>I hear the influence of Galaxie 500 in Full Ugly, and the beginning of ?Drove Down? reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=_Wlixo0IRlc&amp;">?Tugboat?</a>. Were they a big band for you?</strong><br/>
To be honest, I got into them after recording our album, just realising the similarities. It&#8217;s never been a big part of [my] influences.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/71705373?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=c9ff23" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Do you think much about influences in general, or do just block that out and do what you&#8217;re going to do?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t block it out. I guess I have good intuition of what I can sound like and how I deliver the songs. I just go with that and it seems to fit &#8211; nowhere [in particular], really. Whatever people wanna say it sounds like, I&#8217;m cool with that.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s that line in ?Summertime? about ?killing all the animals.? What&#8217;s that song about?</strong><br/>
In that summer when I wrote it, two or three years ago, it was one of the stinking hot days. It [was like] everything&#8217;s gonna die because it&#8217;s getting so hot. It just felt that way on that day.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of the lyrics seem to have that autobiographical slant, just observing your surroundings. Is that your general approach to writing lyrics?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I try and write stories, but everything&#8217;s just autobiographical. How I deal with a situation &#8211; or, yeah, if I&#8217;m annoyed &#8211; generally comes out clearer. I can&#8217;t really tell an interesting story other than something that&#8217;s happened to myself or how I&#8217;m feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Is the newer material much different to the older stuff?</strong><br/>
Not necessarily. I just feel like I&#8217;ve gotten better at guitar and I&#8217;m wanting to do more interesting things. As far as lyrics, it&#8217;s still the same method: trying to write about a situation or how I&#8217;m feeling. Or let somebody know [something]. Not directly, because that&#8217;s a bit strange if you do that. But it&#8217;s always personal.</p>
