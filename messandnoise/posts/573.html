                <h3><strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>* and **JON TJHIA** watched 13 bands in 10 hours at Saturday&#8217;s Laneway Festival at the Footscray Community Arts Centre in Melbourne. Photos by *</em>LEAH ROBERTSON</strong>.
</h3>
<p>DL: A night before the Laneway Festival came to Footscray for the second year running, Melbourne was blindsided by an unprecedented downpour of cyclonic rain. Homes and businesses were inundated. Train stations became Olympic-size swimming pools. People were swept off their feet in the CBD. St Kilda practically turned into Venice.</p>
<p>By the next morning, Footscray Community Arts Centre was left relatively unscathed, save for a PA left uncovered on The River Stage. It meant stage openers <strong>Rat Vs Possum</strong> were canned as organisers rushed to find a replacement system. It was a disappointing turn of events for the Melbourne four-piece, especially after their memorable performance at Meredith last year, but if it&#8217;s any consolation they&#8217;ve been promised a return slot in 2012. (Smart thinking by organisers: They may have taken over the world by then.)</p>

<p/>
<p>Over on the Moreland Street Stage, a large crowd has gathered to watch Sydney&#8217;s <strong>The Holidays</strong>. Last year&#8217;s debut album <em>Post Paradise</em> was an unmitigated success, topping many end-of-year lists and earning them $15,000 courtesy of the Australian Music Prize, but they&#8217;re still working out ways to recreate its intricacies live. Percussionist David Zucker, looking resplendent in an Area 7 t-shirt, is a nice short-term fix. He adds some much needed energy to an otherwise flat set (in fairness, the crowd gives them nothing), and at one point catches a shaker thrown to him across stage by drummer Andrew Kerridge. Excellent hand-eye coordination is always something to be celebrated.</p>
<p>As I wind my way down to the Car Park stage, <strong>Violent Soho&#8217;s</strong> pummeling post-grunge can be heard as far back as the Mini chill-out area, about 200 metres back. (Unlike Meredith, Laneway are not averse to corporate dollars.) The Mansfield four-piece are the ?heaviest? band on the bill by a long way, and they&#8217;re determined to let everyone within an earshot &#8211; and beyond &#8211; know it. Their loud-soft-loud dynamics are a nice throwback to an era when bands like this dominated festival bills, and even though the whole thing is a bit 1993, I&#8217;m partial to Luke Boerdam&#8217;s bratty attitude and acerbic sprays. They dedicate ?Muscle Junkie? to <em>M+N* (?Fuck you, fuck you/I won&#8217;t trust you?) and it takes three false starts to kick the Pixies-ish ?Jesus Stole My Girlfriend? into gear. They inexplicably end the set, like The Holidays, with the ubiquitous, ?We&#8217;ve *been</em> Violent Soho.? Are they changing their name?</p>
<p>A short stroll along the Maribyrnong for Melbourne&#8217;s <strong>World&#8217;s End Press</strong>, who are doing their best to turn the River Stage into a sweaty Berlin discotheque. For the most part it&#8217;s working: there&#8217;s a heaving throng at the front of the stage that intensifies during an extended jam of ?Faithful?. Singer John Parkinson&#8217;s delivery is impassioned and pointed (?Do you know what it means to be faithful??), and the band plays with a sense of conviction that seems perfectly suited to a festival stage. They send out their ?commiserations? to good friends Rat Vs Possum, and end the set with ?Golden Child?, a Euro house-inspired number, that sparks a dance-off between Parkinson and bassist-turned-percussionist Sashi Dharann. They&#8217;re surely our next dance crossover world-beaters, following eagerly in the path Midnight Juggernauts and Cut Copy have paved.</p>

<p/>
<p>JT: One of the delights of a music festival is the dispersed harmonic wash you hear as you round the bend or scale the hill, approaching the stage. Walking toward Laneway&#8217;s Carpark Stage, though, I could only furrow my brow as Richard Pike&#8217;s voice wailed across the bitumen expanse. <strong>&#8220;PVT?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who isn&#8217;t a fan of the Sydney gang&#8217;s vocal-oriented songs. While it&#8217;s pointless to dwell on the band&#8217;s slow metamorphosis from nerdy post-jazz collective to synth rock trio, there&#8217;s something musically amiss in PVT&#8217;s new bombast. Though incredibly energetic &#8211; who could avoid staring at inimitable drummer Lawrence Pike, for example, standing up and sitting down restlessly, nodding his head wildly as he spiders about the kit &#8211; the only people throwing shapes at this early hour are the lighting techs. Oh, and computer player Dave Miller, whose lanky frame paces the right of the stage, bouncing and twisting as he triggers, hits, cues.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the dystopic vibe of their cavernous compositions. <em>Church With No Magic</em> single &#8216;Window&#8217;, in which Richard&#8217;s vocals are the marriage of Gary Numan and The Arcade Fire&#8217;s Win Butler, is insipid and bland. It&#8217;s in their extended instrumental stretches that the band hit their stride, especially when drummer Pike is given more breathing space.</p>

<p>DL: Are <strong>Cloud Control</strong> suffering from festival fatigue? The Blue Mountains-born outfit have played over a dozen this summer, including a terrific stint at the <a href="/articles/4148293">Meredith Music Festival in Victoria</a>, but they just seem to be going through the motions in front of the afternoon&#8217;s biggest crowd at the River Stage. Their cover of Kid Cudi&#8217;s ?Pursuit of Happiness? is becoming predictable, as is the short snippet of The Butthole Surfers? ?Pepper? during ?Gold Canary?. A tour boat cruising along the Maribyrnong during a nicely reworked version of 2008 single ?Death Cloud? is part of what makes this festival so unique. It doesn&#8217;t change the fact the band need some new material &#8211; and a break.</p>

<p>JT: While I think <strong>Beach House</strong> are an incredible band, the Moreland Stage &#8211; Laneway Melbourne&#8217;s largest &#8211; is a strange place to see them.  Positioned evenly across the front of vast stage, the Baltimore trio open with &#8216;Walk In The Park&#8217;. Even in the studio their dreamy pop has always been well suited to a long echo, but the cloudy daylight and squashy crowd dilutes the intimacy that&#8217;s so central to their music.  Guitarist Alex Scally, looking crisp and beardless, perches sideways on his chair for the first couple of songs: an adolescent visage, some subconscious nod to the ?Teen Dream? they&#8217;re playing out.  </p>
<p>&#8216;Silver Soul&#8217; and &#8216;Norway&#8217; follow, but there&#8217;s too much use of backing tracks, and few can really hear Scally&#8217;s guitar adequately.  Even the epic operatics of Victoria LeGrand are muddy and distant, so I shuffle through the tight assembly to check out buzz band Warpaint instead.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3018037/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>Warpaint</strong> are really Californian.  When I first see them, I can&#8217;t help but be reminded of 4 Non Blondes &#8211; a floppy hat here, a baggy garment there, and singer-guitarist Emily Kokal&#8217;s knees-forward dancing. A drummer who sounds a bit like drum lessons. Industry.  Technique. Connections. LA.</p>
<p>The feted quartet deliver on some of their promise, particularly the ethereal quality of their vocal harmonies and spooky basslines, and the much remarked upon attractiveness of their membership (shrug). But, on the whole, they aren&#8217;t the powerful force that wrote the amazingly dark &#8216;Elephants&#8217;. Whether it&#8217;s the context is hard to guess &#8211; their charm has always lain in the delicacy of their guitar and bass. Without those, they&#8217;re merely a hype band filtered through an unflattering bassy rock festival sound system.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3018038/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Also from LA, five-piece <strong>Local Natives</strong> first caught my ear with a cover of Talking Heads&#8217; ?Warning Sign?. While bearing no particular deviation from the original, it fares surprisingly well. Perhaps because it bears no particular deviation from the original. Though I&#8217;ve never heard them before, I&#8217;m clearly in the minority &#8211; the crowd love their harmonised voices and upbeat, folk-coloured pop. They&#8217;ve attracted a lot of Twitter buzz from this Laneway tour, and it&#8217;s not hard to see why. #solid</p>
<p>While man-child <strong>Ariel Pink</strong>&#8216;s pecker bump makes a noticeable impression on the singer&#8217;s gleaming lam? tights, his band Haunted Graffiti works its lysergic magic on songs from <em>Before Today</em>, the group&#8217;s latest LP. Rendering the record&#8217;s nostalgic sound is a formidable task, and Haunted Graffiti do so without breaking a sweat &#8211; then again, their 24-carat wardrobe (notwithstanding one safari suit) probably deflects a lot of sunlight. </p>
<p>Deadened drums, druggy lounge bar keys and falsetto vox set the scene firmly in the past, while the long-haired Tim Koh, looking a true dork wizard, noodles his way through hilariously funky basslines. There&#8217;s little else to remark upon; Ariel Pink delivers. The highlight?  Closing their set with &#8220;Bright Lit Blue Skies&#8221;.  Saggy pop perfection.</p>

<p>DL: New York&#8217;s <strong>Les Savy Fav</strong> have no songs, but they have a maniacal face-painted frontman who launches himself into the crowd and later the Maribyrnong like he&#8217;s just won the Australian Open. Tim Harrington is outrageous and funny and impossible to take your eyes off &#8211; it&#8217;s just a pity he&#8217;s fronting such an unimaginatively ?angular? band.</p>

<p>JT: Equally, I may never understand the fuss about <strong>Deerhunter</strong>. Is it because Bradford Cox wears a beanie with ear bits? Is it because bassist Josh Fauver plays with a cruisy grin and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth?  Deerhunter play indie rock. From my vantage, it looks as though Fauver&#8217;s cigarette remains unlit the whole time. If that&#8217;s so, Fauver&#8217;s cigarette is like the perfect analogy for this band, whose reviewers always make them sound more interesting than they are.</p>
<p>After a swap with Holy Fuck, <strong>Blonde Redhead</strong> are lucky enough to take the Carpark Stage at twilight &#8211; giving their aura a little leg up.  Not that they need it. Possibly the most elegant band in rock, the New York trio ooze classiness (with some notable detours via Kazu Makino&#8217;s sparkly trousers and divisive dance moves). Their songs toe the line between confessional openness and aloof aesthetics, but onstage the group are a little more joyous than their wooze-gaze sound might suggest.</p>
<p>Launching into ?Falling Man?, it seems they&#8217;re about the loudest band of the day. It works for them. Playing songs from latest album <em>Penny Sparkle*, as well as a smattering of favourites from *23</em> (?Spring And By Summer Fall?), the group share their load with a touring synth player. It&#8217;s possibly thanks to him that their lofty charm is slightly less hindered by prerecorded help than during their disappointingly distant Melbourne show of 2007.</p>
<p>?Melody of Certain Three?, from an album released 11 years ago (pre-backing tracks), is a satisfyingly rough, raw inclusion. And, in the flesh, they demonstrate why recent single ?Not Getting There? is a truly memorable piece of moody, muscular synth-pop. A fantastic show.</p>

<p>A funny thing happens to Laneway once the lights go down and the big names begin to appear.  The wide-eyed, fashionably dressed &#8220;hipsters&#8221; (aka Young People That Everyone &lt;3s Bitching About) go to the alt-headliners' stages or internet messageboards or disappear completely, and a previously unseen swarm of drunken guys and dolls on pills sprout from the ground near the largest stage. Of course, because all sprouting things require liquids to grow, by the time they've emerged they're busting for a slash.

<strong>Cut Copy</strong> are one of only a few bands that got to play under cover of night, and it&#8217;s a boon for their fans, such as Legion Of Guys Taking A Leak Through Cyclone Fencing And Wearing Singlets. Though the festival miraculously avoided dire weather forecasts and the exhilaration of the preceding night&#8217;s flash flooding, I found myself edging toward higher ground as flat noodles of piss rolled slowly closer, and a voice echoed: &#8220;How you all doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the Melbourne electro-pop phenoms took the stage, it was dominated by a rectangular structure shrouded in yellow cloth. &#8220;Oooh,&#8221; we thought. What could be under it? Dan Whitford?  An incredibly huge and excellent synthesiser? An Oprah-style gift-to-all-y&#8217;all?  When the cloth came off, it was a big white door. And when the door opened, Cut Copy walked through it. SFXY!</p>
<p>?Feel The Love? brought the crowd to life, quick as sea monkeys.  Instant party: singalongs, Shoulder Riding Girls, hollering and dancing. The fact that Cut Copy never really play non-festival headline shows in Melbourne is tiresome to some, but in truth it&#8217;s probably because they&#8217;re just better at festivals. The tiered stage has the group&#8217;s six or so live members toiling in their own generous amounts of personal space as they work the crowd in a curiously detached manner, clumsily triggering samples over what seems to be a very compelling collection of backing tracks.</p>

<p>Then something amazing happens. The door, which has been sitting dormant (sorry) this whole time, turns out to be surrounded by multi-coloured lights that start to pulse as they scroll through the spectrum, and ?Lights And Music? whips the crowd into a greater frenzy (after their kind acquiescence with some less familiar <em>Zonoscope</em> material). Then something even more amazing happens. After sitting ajar for some moments (Is someone else going to come out, or was it just draughty?), the door actually spins around to reveal its true spirit. IT&#8217;S A SCREEN!</p>
<p>Current radio hit (and sneaky slow burner) ?Take Me Over?, is adequate &#8211; but can we really talk about a performance here? There is very little that the band seem to be doing on stage which makes its way out of the speakers and into our heads. The only sounds which are recognisably ?live? are the tiny mistakes from time to time. Many have commented before on the spectacle of a show like this, so it&#8217;s no surprise to anybody. But as far as a mass listening experience goes, there&#8217;s a lovable sense of distraction. And it&#8217;s not just listening. The vivid blues and simmering pinks of the lighting rig aren&#8217;t just decoration; they&#8217;re a pleasurable composition unto themselves.</p>

<p>Hats and cowbells and synths and basslines and kick drums and claps and lights and among it all, the screen door, whose narrative is slowly but surely unraveling. First it&#8217;s a mirrored blue sky with white clouds kaleidoscopically emanating from its central point, then it&#8217;s a city scene, and finally explosions with fire and black smoke. Meanwhile, we dance among one another, and some faint voice in the backs of our minds feebly warns us about the dangers of thongs and the crushed cans on the floor and tetanus.</p>
<p>But the explosions tell us not to worry so much, because everything is so deftly unreal. The guy next to the screen door swings his guitar around as he turns to the sampler to tap a new rhythm.  Band members take turns vamping a little amid the colour of the show. Somewhere in the front, young men and women are dancing together; a few are fighting, and some are falling in love. This crisp, clean and spacious sound is moving us to dance and others to clap, yell, sing, piss. We are not ourselves.</p>
