                <h3>DC Root guides us through Root!?s second album &#8216;Surface Paradise&#8217;, a self-described ?bombastic, hectoring load of old Rococo nonsense, brought to you by a band who should know better?.
</h3>
<img class="r" data-src="/images/3006310/440x389-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<h2>?Surface Paradise Parts 5, 18, 35, 36, 47 &amp; 92?</h2>
<p>Communism. <em>Yasmin&#8217;s Getting Married</em>. Yahoo Serious. Cascade Premium downsizing to 330ml. Napoleon&#8217;s Russian tour. Hitler&#8217;s Russian tour. Beta video cassettes. Cherry Coke. Michael Jackson naming an album after his ?number ones?. Beyonce naming her album after something she&#8217;d use to clean up after her ?number ones? &#8211; This track was a good idea at the time too. </p>
<h2>?Surface Paradise Part 13?</h2>
<p>For a brief time in my youth, I wanted to be a journalist. It seemed to me an aspiration as lofty as medicine or law. I figured you&#8217;d have to be really smart, and they&#8217;d only let the smartest ones get a job. Shit, what sort of a deluded loser was I? The word ?journalist? now conjures up the following: female, blonde, 20-something, beautiful, robotic intonation, nodding head. Now your gangsta&#8217;s idea of a party is incomplete without ?coke and journos?. What&#8217;s gone wrong? Where have all the ugly people gone? Has some cosmic Rudy Giuliani come along and done a zero tolerance thing on the gene pool?</p>
<h2>?My Other Bumper Sticker Is Intelligent?</h2>
<p>By and large, rock lyricists get away with murder. The majority, thanks to the fine work done by Bob Zimmerman immediately after his protest song era, think it&#8217;s OK to string words together in an enigmatic fashion, then, when questioned, ?leave it to the listener&#8217;s interpretation?. In the hands of a clever lyricist (like said Zimmo), or a couple of my favourites like Howard Devoto (?Keep your silence to yourself?) or Luke Haines (?I&#8217;d like to thank my mother for inventing rock&#8217;n?roll?), it&#8217;s a thing of beauty; an open-ended device that still says something even without saying anything. Then there&#8217;s the road trains full of mediocre also-rans who think that writing a stupid line about their stupid break-up with their stupid girlfriend, all in a code that only they understand, somehow doesn&#8217;t take an enormous liberty with a paying audience who frankly deserve better. On this song, I come into this latter category.</p>
<h2>?(Sort Of) Emo?         </h2>
<p>Not much of a title, is it? I actually made a conscious decision to steer away from puns on this album. Some reviewers, usually the ones who resent the fact that they are only slightly more clever than me, see a pun and immediately stop listening to the music. So I thought, ?OK, I won&#8217;t give them any ammunition.? But then I went and called the album <em>Surface Paradise</em>. Sigh. What was I doing? Now you don&#8217;t even need the album to review it! Sure enough, one of the first reviews &#8211; actually quite an intelligent and positive review it was, so who&#8217;s complaining? &#8211; opened with this line: ?Oh Lord, let the puns commence!? Shame really. I wanted to call this song ?OK Commuter?. Or ?My Clerical Romance?.</p>
<h2>?Thank God You&#8217;re Here?          </h2>
<p>Steve Root is our keyboard player. He is a trained keyboardist. Massively trained. Classically trained. The man could whip out a quick piano concerto with the effort it takes me to whip out reviewer-alienating puns (see ?(Sort Of) Emo?). Anyway, it must be hard being Steve Root and being in this band, because he can do anything from Shostakovich to Thelonious Monk, and here he is playing songs written by a one-finger keyboardist: me. So my songs bound between jarring key signatures like a one-year-old Labrador between tables at a barbie. I somehow write songs that sound really really simple, yet are really really complex, can&#8217;t be guessed with an intuitive knowledge of chord progressions and have arrangements that follow no discernable pattern. Take this song. Here is the arrangement:</p>
<p>13 bars country<br/>
3 bars half-time rock<br/>
26 bars country<br/>
4 bars dubstep-style breakdown<br/>
12 bars half-time rock</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s only verse one.</p>
<h2>?Famous For Being Famous For Being Famous?</h2>
<p>There is a beautiful, rare moment in this song, a shimmering, epiphanic little bit of happenstance that makes the whole goddamn thing worth buying, right at the end where the final chorus happens, where you think you&#8217;ve heard it all and then you&#8217;re lifted up on the wings of cherubim and transported out, out, away and above the smog of preconception, beyond your troubles, your low-level anxieties, your income-exceeding-debt, your ill-advised relationships, your chapters of remorse, your fumbled litany of excuses, your asymmetric disappointing physio gamy, your every weakness and regret and act of unintentional cruelty, to a place where there is silence and calm and beauty. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the bit in the song where I fucking shut up. </p>
<h2>?Orange People?</h2>
<p>One of my favourite books of all time &#8211; one that I doubt will be made available on Kindle, which, by the way, sounds eerily like ?kindling?, and, if you&#8217;ve read <em>Fahrenheit 451* you&#8217;ll know where that leads &#8211; is called *Beautiful Orange</em> and was written by David Winner. It describes the passage of my favourite football team of all time &#8211; the early ?70s Dutch national team &#8211; to their eventual, and according to Winner, psychologically inevitable demise at the hand of the inexorable West Germans in the 1974 World Cup. I love that Dutch team, not for Cruyff&#8217;s imperious, liquid grace; not for Neesken&#8217;s combination of elite skill and best practice violence; not for their rigorously cerebral pioneering of ?total football?; or their fabulously arrogant walk-sprint ball movement. No, I love them for their sideburns. </p>
<p>Where was I? Oh, sorry, look, you can sum this song up with one couplet: ?Orange People in the corporate world, climbing up the ladder/Doing coke but looking more like Fanta.?</p>
<h2>?Joe Blogs?         </h2>
<p>Well, if you don&#8217;t count the album title, I got all the way to track eight before I punned. And it turns out, my pun isn&#8217;t even original because, of course, there&#8217;s a blogger called <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/12410154061956348030">Jo Thornely</a> who blogs under the moniker ?Jo Blogs?. Initially, when I discovered this, I became my usual mean-spirited self, assuming that Jo, like 90 percent of bloggers I read, was simply adding another to the cascading wave of opinions we don&#8217;t need from people whose confidence mightily exceeds their talent. However, I read a few of her missives (MISSive &#8211; there&#8217;s a pun someone could use), and despite myself, I have to admit that Jo writes with humour and style. All power to her, then.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Someday someone&#8217;s going to come and tell me Accrington Stanley &#8211; one of my favourite sporting team names of all time &#8211; has changed its name to The Acca Arrows. It&#8217;s always pointlessly heroic and often wrong. Perth Glory? When they&#8217;re on the bottom??</p></blockquote>
<p>But I do hope, at least, that even though I was unintentionally ripping off her title, maybe I am using the pun ?Joe Blogs? in a purer sense than Jo Thornely is using it. When I hear the phrase ?Joe Bloggs? (note the extra ?G?) to me it means an identity-less person, a nobody/anybody. Like ?Mr A Citizen? it represents an average person who is part of the great unknown population. As soon as Joe Bloggs becomes known, he or she is no longer Joe Bloggs. Jo Thornely blogs, and she is famous. She is read, commented on. She is not, therefore, a ?Joe Bloggs?. But my Joe is blogging, has nothing to say, and no-one is listening. Precisely the state of existence that blogging and Facebook and twitter and ?youhavenofriends.com? and any other form of social networking would have you believe they eradicate. Blogging means any shithead can become ?famous? simply by having an opinion. But my Joe character, despite all the technological advancements at his fingertips, is still too average, too diffident, too self-conscious, to allow them to magically improve his social standing. Hmm. Jesus, I&#8217;ve crapped on here, haven&#8217;t I? Makes you wish for that bit in track six (?Famous For Being Famous For Being Famous?), really.</p>
<h2>?Everybody Loves You (Longtime)?</h2>
<p>Advertising, like insurance, dental check-ups and religion, is the evil you have to have. But what I hate even more than advertising is advertising that is designed to seem NOT like advertising. There was a period there where it was called ?integration?, which I always found interesting, because when I was a school teacher, ?integration? meant your class, hanging as it was on the knife edge of anarchy, was about to have some poor kid with serious mental issues thrown into the mix, often without an integration aide, so that at any time he might jump from his seat, run out of the room, go round to the windows at the back of the classroom and start leaning in and punching kids on the back of the head. This happened to me. So when I hear the word ?integration? I get a little chill up my spine. But no, ?integration? came to mean something else in the world of marketing. It became a buzzword, a cure-all, an ideas person&#8217;s biggest crutch, and even entered into some people&#8217;s job titles.</p>
<p>So how does this form of ?integration? work? Well, for instance, tune in to the footy on TV or read about it in the papers lately, and you&#8217;ll find someone pretty soon starts talking about the betting odds on a given match. It becomes part of a news story even. Why is that? Because a betting company has paid big bucks for the privilege. On the Saturday news &#8211; not sure what channel &#8211; there&#8217;s a segment near the end where the editor of the <em>Herald Sun* tells us about what&#8217;s in tomorrow&#8217;s headlines. Tomorrow&#8217;s headlines? No, tomorrow&#8217;s *HERALD SUN</em> headlines. Keeping us up to date on what&#8217;s happening? No, a fucking ad. </p>
<p>If McDonald&#8217;s really want to give money to charity, couldn&#8217;t they do it anonymously? Ah, I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;re all aware of this shit. Doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to go around with a bic ballpoint pen stabbing the eyes out of the people responsible.</p>

<h2>?Uncle Vom Vom?</h2>
<p>One of my many jobs was as an attendant at the Keysborough Hotel bottle shop. These days it&#8217;s probably a nicely appointed ?cellar? type arrangement, but when I was there, it was more like Calder Raceway, offering a drive-thru convention centre for the sociopathic wife-beating population of the outer south-east. I worked the bloodbath shift &#8211; Saturday nights, 4.30pm till 11pm. For every second of those six-and-a-half hours, cars were queuing up right through the bottle shop and for about another half-a-kilometre down Cheltenham Road. In every other car, a fuming, pissed, disenfranchised Centrelink stalker was waiting for you to tell him that we only had Carlton Light &#8211; or worse still, we&#8217;d just had a delivery of VB, but it wasn&#8217;t cold &#8211; which was tantamount to wearing early Spandau Ballet chic and asking him if he knew the bittersweet pain of loving a man.</p>
<p>One night, an old Kingswood pulled up, passenger side facing me. The driver was middle-aged, menacing, lidded-eyes. His passenger, sitting not two feet away but staring resolutely ahead of her, looked about 13, was dressed like a hooker and had a jaundiced pallor and truly unhappy expression. Something was odd, even in this madhouse. Had they just fought? The driver barked their order and handed me the money across the girl. For some reason when I returned with the bottles, instead of passing them through the girl&#8217;s open window, something told me to walk around the car and give them to the driver. Maybe it was a deep sense of conscience that I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to serve liquor to a minor. Anyway, it was kismet, because the second I deposited the booze in the car, he hit the pedal and they screeched out of the drive thru, and as they did, the girl projectile vomited through the window and sprayed her stomach contents like a busted fire hydrant in a neatly curving parabola all over the place where I had just been standing. </p>
<h2>?Crown Tower Blues? </h2>
<p>I dunno. It&#8217;s blues. It&#8217;s sort of ripped off. Like all other echoes of a musical past, it&#8217;s got pokies in it. Can I go now?</p>
<h2>?I Hang Out With The Guys In Jet (?S Uncle)?</h2>
<p>Shit, I&#8217;m beginning to regret putting so many tracks on this album? </p>
<h2>?Home??</h2>
<p>In this song I feel like Sam from <em>Life On Mars*. Not the US version, thank you very much, which ends on a spaceship for chrissakes. Actually, maybe that&#8217;s what I feel like. I feel like I&#8217;ve been dumped from the original version of *Life On Mars</em> onto the US spaceship. Same TV show. Same details. No fucking idea. </p>
<p>Am I just an anachronism? Probably. I was watching the Ashes the other night and you could see scores flashing up on the scoreboard at the ground, presumably of county cricket matches. And I saw ?Sussex Sharks? playing ?Lancashire Lightning?. What&#8217;s going on? Surely English county cricket is the absolute last bastion of quaint sporting tradition. Looks like it&#8217;s stumps for that as well.</p>
<p>Someday someone&#8217;s going to come and tell me Accrington Stanley &#8211; one of my favourite sporting team names of all time &#8211; has changed its name to The Acca Arrows. It&#8217;s always pointlessly heroic and often wrong. Perth Glory? When they&#8217;re on the bottom?</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be great if we could put a little more human traits into sporting team names. Sussex Schadenfreude. Essex Ethnic-Cleansers. That type of thing.</p>
<h2>?I Fought The Groove Police?       </h2>
<p>OK, OK, in these answers, increasingly, I seem to have abandoned traditional narrative for a stream-of-consciousness approach. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, It must mean I&#8217;ve got nothing to say. Why don&#8217;t I just talk about the music? Trouble is, who gives a shit? I mean, really, does anyone on these pages, other than the people who wrote these things, actually read them?</p>
<p>No. Didn&#8217;t think so. Right. It&#8217;s just me then. Good, well, better use this to advantage:</p>
<p><strong>To do list:</strong></p>
<p>Check tyres<br/>
Get milk<br/>
Need 12W globe for bathroom<br/>
Remember Dad&#8217;s birthday<br/>
Try not to pick on Short Stack<br/>
Answer next question, as if someone gives a shit</p>
<h2>?Surface Paradise Parts 25?31?</h2>
<p>Hello. Thanks for reading this, my million-strong constituency. As resident genius and iconic figure of post-modernist rock band ROOT!, I thought I&#8217;d open the doors to the fascinating world behind the scenes of our sprawling, intensely ambitious hour-long song cycle <em>Surface Paradise</em>. For instance, did you know this track references a 1941 cowboy tune by Bob Nolan? And it was the first thing written for the album? That&#8217;s correct, and I know you&#8217;re fascinated and keenly reading on. My musical collaborator Henri Root, who sometimes provides the violent denouement to my nancy-boy narratives, came up with a two-chord refrain that had a desolate, lonely, panoramic quality to it, and in his usual fashion, thought not of two chords but of a huge, anthemic, mini-operatic scale, which led to me looking for motifs within the half-songs that we had already written, and lyrical themes which I could &#8211; shit, the toast is burning!</p>
