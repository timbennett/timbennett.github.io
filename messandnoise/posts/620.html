                <h3>Melbourne&#8217;s Wagons is an Australian outlaw-country success story 10 years in the making, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>*. Henry Wagons photo by **KANE HIBBERD**, band shots by *</em>MICHAEL CHRISTIAN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020659/427x640-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Wagons? fifth album <em>Rumble, Shake and Tumble* is the feel-good story for any band that&#8217;s slugged it away for 10-plus years. The catalyst for their late career resurgence &#8211; they spent their formative years as Melbourne&#8217;s in-house outlaw-country act &#8211; was 2009?s *The Rise and Fall of Goodtown*. The album topped *M+N</em>?s <a href="/articles/3821430">Readers Poll</a> and landed the band two EG Awards for Best Album and Best Group, but it was the relentless touring that preceded it, says frontman Henry Wagons, that really got the ball rolling on their career. </p>
<p>For the first time since the band formed in 1999, Henry Wagons has now embraced life as a full-time musician, coinciding with a recent deal with US bookers High Road Touring, home to the likes of Wilco, Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris and Australian counterparts the Temper Trap, The Drones and Sarah Blasko. The partnership will see the band spend two-and-a-half months in the States later this year. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3020660/440x463-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
?When I heard those guys were interested in us, I couldn&#8217;t believe it,? says the ever humble and eminently quotable Wagons. ?Lucinda, Wilco, Ween and Drive-By Truckers, I love all those guys. The idea of being just a degree of separation from them is really exciting.?</p>
<p>Sitting in a cafe in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, Wagons? enthusiasm for pretty much everything &#8211; from the prospect of eating more hot dogs in the US to his gold horseshoe ring (?a gift from my girl?) and the deluxe doggy clean-up bags he&#8217;s just bought for his two pugs, Gordon and Peeps &#8211; is palpable and genuine.</p>
<p><strong>?Downlow? threw me a bit for a loop. It&#8217;s an interesting choice for a first single.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a natural evolution for me. I&#8217;ve always been a massive Jeff Lynne fan, particularly his production work on bad late-?80s, early-?90s Travelling Wilburys, late George Harrison. I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a song like ?I&#8217;ve Got My Mind Set On You?, or ?End Of The Line?? Turns out it was an unusual single, because I don&#8217;t think the rest of the album is particularly like it.</p>
<p><strong>It was a bit of a ruse, because I was expecting an album of Tom Petty pop-rock hits.</strong><br/>
I could never be Tom Petty. I always seem to fall back on a bastardisation of live Elvis and Johnny Cash records, and I don&#8217;t necessarily think that&#8217;s a bad thing &#8211; I didn&#8217;t choose the single. I just said to people I trust, to people putting out the record [Spunk!], ?I have no idea which song&#8217;s better or worse, tell me which one is least shit.? Everyone seemed to engage, or connect in an interesting way with that song. So we thought we&#8217;d try it out.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s definitely generated interest in the record.</strong><br/>
I think it&#8217;s divided some people. I was really summoning some strange demons when I was writing that song. When I write I generally like to make myself laugh and smile, no matter how serious the subject matter. I was genuinely getting off on how good George Thorogood some of it was sounding &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want to sound like a high budget sell-out production now , but I have a really soft spot for high budget Springsteen, <em>Born In The USA</em>. I just really wanted to have something on the record like that. I think I got it 65 percent right.</p>
<p><strong>The one that&#8217;s been mentioned a bit is ?Bittersweet? by The Hoodoo Gurus.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I heard that. It&#8217;s only a song I know quite vaguely. I think the actual riff is based around E, A and D. They&#8217;re some of the first chords you learn when you pick up the guitar. So me, the Hoodoo Gurus and every half-arsed guitar playing eight-year-old child has stumbled on that riff at some point. It&#8217;s like a monkey writing Shakespeare. You&#8217;re probably going to stumble on that riff within the first three minutes of learning the guitar. No offence to Hoodoo Gurus or the guys in Wagons. I got off on how universal and massive sounding it was; just playing something so elemental ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always said any comparison to a band that&#8217;s done well out of music is flattering to me. I don&#8217;t get offended if someone says, ?That song sounds like Springsteen.? That&#8217;s incredibly humbling. It&#8217;s not like I buy sheet music from Allen&#8217;s and go home and pick it apart. I&#8217;m just mucking around on the guitar. A whole lot of subconscious influences seep in &#8211; whether it&#8217;s Springsteen, The Hoodoo Gurus, or music for an ab workout machine combined with the <em>Different Strokes</em> theme. They all come together somehow.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s not just Willie Nelson?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s not just Willie. He was a large part of the soundtrack to our latest trip to the States. He&#8217;s pretty much played all the time in Austin. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s the people we were hanging out with.</p>
<p><strong>Is that what the song [?Willie Nelson?] is inspired by?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a Wayfaring Strangers song. Wayfaring Strangers were around when Wagons first started. At the very end of the Punters Club [in Melbourne] we played a gig with them. They were headlining and I really loved them. ?Willie Nelson? really struck a chord &#8211; We were struggling to get together a set-list together at some point, so we learned ?Willie Nelson? and we&#8217;ve been playing it ever since. We&#8217;ve adapted it and added a bridge, sort of fucked it up and eventually put it on the album.</p>
<p><strong>Is it about the fact that Willie doesn&#8217;t get the same props as the others mentioned in the track?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s one of my bugbears when people go, ?Oh man. You know what? Jane&#8217;s Addiction &#8211; they&#8217;re an underrated band.? They&#8217;re all sitting in their mansions in Los Angeles. Megadeth are so underrated. Willie Nelson may still be travelling around in a touring bus and not a private jet, but he&#8217;s set up his family with flavoured soap for generations to come. I love his reputation as an outlaw, outsider artist and I wouldn&#8217;t want him taken in and adopted any more. The size of his pedestal is perfect for him, and it&#8217;s quite high and massive.</p>
<p><strong>I think his one play for the big time, that duet with Julio Iglesias, has changed perceptions of him for better or worse.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] He does get around though. He&#8217;s a bit like Snoop Dogg &#8211; if the fee is right he&#8217;ll play on anything. He played with Jessica Simpson not that long ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I think the fact I wear glasses gives off an illusion of intelligence, sophistication and culture that&#8217;s not actually there.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Moving on, I feel that I&#8217;m speaking to you at a time when Wagons is at the height of their popularity, or heading there anyway.</strong><br/>
How weird is that? We&#8217;ve been around for a long time. I feel a kind of rebirth in a sense. For the first six years, none of us had any aspirations. I didn&#8217;t take music as seriously as perhaps I should&#8217;ve. I just loved sucking on the teats of the Melbourne scene and just having fun playing music around town &#8211; It sounds like a cliche, but it wasn&#8217;t until our manager showed some interest in us and we got a booking agent and we started being sent around places that we started &#8211; to catch on around the country. I&#8217;m actually really surprised how similar everywhere seems to be. Whether it be the States or in the UK, there&#8217;s always a local scene and a bunch of key music fans and tastemakers &#8211; I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring more of these pockets around the world. I never imagined I&#8217;d be doing this five years ago, but I&#8217;m happy to be doing so. I love burgers.</p>
<p><strong>What was the turning point, do you think?</strong><br/>
Probably our last record, <em>The Rise and Fall of Goodtown*. Or maybe it was a bit earlier. The record before that, *The Curse Of Lightening</em>, was our first record in three years. We sort of dropped out and took a long time to get it out. That&#8217;s when our management and all those extra bits and pieces came together. That&#8217;s when we started touring around Australia &#8211; and dedicating more concerted time to it. I knew that once I knew my drummer&#8217;s sock routine, how long it takes for my bass player to be in the shower and what it smells like when my guitarist takes his shoes off, I was seriously dedicated to these boys in this band in a deeper way than I ever could&#8217;ve imagined. </p>
<p>It really changed when we tried to create a national presence after the <em><a href="/releases/5791">Curse of Lightning</a>* [2007]. When *Goodtown* came out, there was a bit of a foundation for an Australia-wide listenership. Even though we played the shitty gigs that everyone talks about &#8211; it was hilarious to play a buck&#8217;s party in Hamilton, or be there on the only day it rained in the Gold Coast at a condemned venue &#8211; you never know who&#8217;s going to be there. Of the 15 people that were there in 2006, those people were more likely to listen to the record. Just getting out there prior to *Goodtown*, and *Goodtown</em> dropping is what changed things for us. It made the whole thing a bit more viable and put a big smile on my face.</p>
<p><strong>In that sense, is this the first record you&#8217;ve made when there&#8217;s been a sense of expectation?</strong><br/>
I guess. I feel in moments of spare thought, I think people are wanting to hear this record &#8211; I guess that excites me more than makes me nervous. The weight of expectation doesn&#8217;t scare me &#8211; it just makes me more enthusiastic to say more.</p>
<p><strong>I was speaking to Dave Graney about this the other week, and he said that after the success of <em>You Wanna Be There But You Don&#8217;t Wanna Travel</em> he wasn&#8217;t as free vocally as he was before. I feel that it&#8217;s the opposite for you on this record.</strong><br/>
If anything, the more people that are paying attention, the louder I want to yell.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>With <em>Goodtown</em>, I felt there was a concept with that album. This one, not so much.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s all an extension of each other. <em>Goodtown* was written from a place where we were travelling a lot. I was listening to a lot of 1970s driving music. I liked the idea of working an album around hillbilly culture; a world in and around a log cabin and sheds. I&#8217;m still listening to those sorts of things, but getting into more [Grand Ole] Opry stuff, the likes of George Jones and Marty Robbins. *Goodtown</em> set us off on an incredibly turbulent journey. For the first time in my life, I&#8217;ve become a full-time musician. As a result you become fully immersed in this world, where people are excited to hear your music and just as excited to play you music? </p>
<p>[<em>Rumble, Shake and Tumble*] is the sum of a whole bunch of different things. Hopefully there&#8217;s some coherency, but I think it&#8217;s a bit more scattered than before. Neil Young&#8217;s *Harvest* is one of my favourite records. You&#8217;ve got songs there that were recorded in the garage, live, others that were incredibly high budget. I&#8217;m not going to pretend that *Rumble, Shake and Tumble* is anything more than the shit on the shoe of that record, but the thing about that album that I want to highlight is that I like records that sound like they&#8217;re from different places and times. I love listening to a good compilation: *Hottest Hits of the ?90s Volume Three*. [*Laughs</em>] I don&#8217;t actually have that.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s a real consistency in production.</strong><br/>
That would be Cornel. He&#8217;s an amazing producer &#8211;  His studio [Electric Dreams in Melbourne] is a realistion of his music. There&#8217;s a lot of amazing analog equipment, a lot of ?70s electronic stuff, as well as the latest of everything. Everything&#8217;s on wheels and can be moved around. It&#8217;s an amazing place to make an outlaw country. Despite Cornel working in a digital world, I think he has a very old-school approach. He adds colour and his production is surprisingly warm. He paints with broad and elaborate brush strokes. He&#8217;s the best person to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have the other Electric Dreams people dropping in. [Magic Silver White&#8217;s] Jojo [Petrina], etc?</strong><br/>
She played organ on <em>Goodtown</em>, but didn&#8217;t play on this record. She was there in another room all the time. She was coming in and offering support. There was Mark Mitchell from Clue to Kalo in another room, John Lee from Mountains in the Sky, all these incredibly creative and respected ears &#8211; It was great to work there.</p>
<p><strong>The outro for ?Follow The Leader? is as out-there as you&#8217;ve ever been.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s our cosmic country [track]. I&#8217;m a big fan of trippy space cowboy stuff. I&#8217;ll probably do more of that ?silver-glittered cowboy boot with rocket attachment? type stuff.</p>
<p><strong>[The Monkees?] Mike Nesmith made a few records like that.</strong><br/>
Totally. I&#8217;m a big fan. He wrote a fiction piece with one of those records that&#8217;s really long. I&#8217;d love to try that one day, who knows if I have the attention span to pull it off. Dave Graney&#8217;s the inspiration for that. He made a concerted effort to try and release a book [<em>1001 Australian Nights*] and a record [*Rock&#8217;n?Roll Is Where I Hide</em>] at once. If he did it, I probably can&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ll die trying.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve got two break-up songs at the top of the album: ?I Blew It? and ?Moon Into A Sun?. I feel it&#8217;s as ?real? as you&#8217;ve been in a while.</strong><br/>
I had been through a break-up since the last record, so I was drawing on that stuff. I think the songs still have a positive driving quality to them. I don&#8217;t want to write sad sack, break-up ballads &#8211; there are plenty of those around. Even though they&#8217;re quite sombre, there&#8217;s that driving turbulence.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>I guess <em>Goodtown</em> was a character-driven record. Did you want to return to something a bit more personal?</strong><br/>
I snuck quite a few personal songs on <em>Goodtown*, but because they were bookended by more storytelling sort of songs, they just slipped under the radar &#8211; A lot of the songs that I write aren&#8217;t personal, they&#8217;re just based on personal stories that I channel &#8211; but not in a sort of pet psychic way. I don&#8217;t do any seances. The last song on the record, ?Marylou?, is inspired by our keyboard player telling me that he bumped into a girl he had a crush on in high school. I ruminated on that for a little while &#8211; A lot of the personal stories get a little asterisk next to them, and then in the footnote they&#8217;d say, ?Not necessarily about Henry Wagons.? [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s hard when you&#8217;re the face of the band.</strong><br/>
I guess that always happens. I have my rhythm section to thank for maybe a little extra emotional instability &#8211; Despite having been through the wash these past couple years, I&#8217;m the furthest thing from the My Chemical Romance emo lead singer. I&#8217;m a pretty stable kinda dude, so when I want some fragility, I always turn to my bandmates for inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a great juxtaposition when Wagons plays live between your singing voice and your speaking voice. Does that confuse people, particularly in the US?</strong><br/>
There are times when I do think no one can understand what I&#8217;m saying, and then I do say, ?None of you can understand a word I&#8217;m saying, can you?? And they seem to understand that! It seems to translate better than I thought it would.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think your future&#8217;s in the States?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to try overseas &#8211; I wanna see if everyone in every continent would like our stuff, so we&#8217;re going to give it a shot. I&#8217;m always excited about a new audience &#8211; whether it be those 15 people at a buck&#8217;s night in Hamilton, or a room full of people in New York City. Just any new people I can play to. It&#8217;s exciting to see their faces in abject horror or enjoyment. Any extreme enjoyment ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got no idea how it&#8217;s going to translate over there [in the States] though. It&#8217;s like bringing American-inspired music back to its home. I was scared about that prospect, but it&#8217;s gone down OK. People seem to be digging it from our initial attempts, so I might go over there and eat some more hotdogs.</p>
<p><strong>This <a href="/news/4238209">massive tour</a> that&#8217;s coming up. Was that inspired by going coast-to-coast in America.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s 20 or so dates. We&#8217;ve done it before. We got a regional touring grant, so we played everywhere. We&#8217;re doing a similar sort of thing. We&#8217;re visiting mining towns, you know. It&#8217;ll be good. I can&#8217;t wait. Twenty dates is only the tip of the iceberg in America. I&#8217;m really worried about what will happen to my waistline after two-and-a-half months, because I really love Philly cheese steak sandwiches just a bit too much. I&#8217;ve been on a health kick for the past two years, but I can already feel the cracks.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m going to try damn hard to make music for the rest of my life &#8211; whether it be from the gutter or a Las Vegas casino at the age of 55.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Your <a href="/articles/4087371">Twitter diary</a> for us was pretty much just a food blog.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] When I was last in Washington State, I was served bacon and choc-chip cookies. I just love that stuff. If anyone tells me what the local specialty is, I&#8217;m just a sucker for it. Hopefully no one reads this from the States and absolutely steers me up shit creek. [*Laughs</em>] Some woman in Canada came up to me and asked me if I eat poutine. I thought it was the most grotesque come-on I&#8217;ve ever heard, but it&#8217;s some sort of mince, bacon and potato hash.</p>
<p><strong>Did you try it?</strong><br/>
We were leaving Toronto the next day, and to be honest, I didn&#8217;t feel like going anywhere outside because it was so fucking cold and my boots weren&#8217;t waterproof.</p>
<p><strong>Are you spending the rest of the year in the States?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re going on a pretty long trip throughout September-October. We&#8217;re being asked to play a couple festivals and shows, so maybe it&#8217;ll stretch it out a bit. Once the record&#8217;s out, it&#8217;s one of those self-perpetuating things, you never know what sort of supports or weird offers that come your way. For all I know I might never be let back in the country again. </p>
<p><strong>You were saying before how music was never a full-time gig. What were you doing before?</strong><br/>
I was always a part-time musician, a part-time something. I always picked jobs that would give me the most time possible dicking around with music. It&#8217;s always been a passion of mine. For many years, I was an English teacher. I ended up teaching at Latrobe University in Melbourne. Then Wagons took over. I still do some TV work. I still present <em>Art Nation</em> [on the ABC] every now and then. Even though it&#8217;s not music, it&#8217;s still a creative and cultural outlet. I&#8217;m basically the show&#8217;s village idiot. I think the fact I wear glasses gives off an illusion of intelligence, sophistication and culture that&#8217;s not actually there.</p>
<p><strong>Is that how you got your lecturing gig as well?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Exactly. Good grammar and glasses.</p>
<p><strong>Were you always hoping to make music full-time?</strong><br/>
No. When I was younger I wanted to be an academic like my dad &#8211; As soon as I enrolled in my postgraduate work, the music came along and I lost my motivation and passion for philosophical ideas. I was an absolute philosophy nerd. And then I preferred hypothesising and postulating from a soapbox behind a guitar. It seemed a lot easier to me than having to spellcheck and footnote and write a bibliography.</p>
<p><strong>Had you given up on making music full-time?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s always been forward momentum in Wagons &#8211; even if no one really devoted much time to it in the first half of our existence. It was a bit of a money-earner, a residency sort of thing. There was always enough of a building snowball to keep everyone excited about the next step, enough to make the next record. I guess there was always a hope that it would take it over, but I guess I never thought it would. And who knows how long it will last? But I have a feeling now that I&#8217;m going to try damn hard to make music for the rest of my life &#8211; whether it be from the gutter or a Las Vegas casino at the age of 55. My career pinnacle would be a Las Vegas residency wearing a wig with badly dyed hair and a tuxedo. That&#8217;d be an absolute dream come true. It may or not be in a bedazzled white suit, but I&#8217;ll be jumping around having a good time.</p>
