                <h3>In this edited extract from his new memoir &#8216;1001 Australian Nights&#8217;, <strong>DAVE GRANEY</strong> explains why he is who he is.

My music, why is it so? I don&#8217;t come to defend or to praise it, merely to draw some attention to its take-off position and its general flight, or long fall to earth.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d been born at a certain time and you moved about the floor at your parents? feet, watching the high heels dig and sink into the linoleum floor, and your mother had records by Elvis (after the army), Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, Skeeter Davis, Trini Lopez, and if your brothers bought a double gatefold single of <em>The Magical Mystery Tour* by the Beatles and your sister had that gloomy picture of Zeppelin on her wall and you had known panel vans as actual interiors and 8-track cartridges as a new and unassailable currency and your cousins the surfers came around one day carrying an album by the Who and if you were Catholic and grew up in a small timber town in South Australia and your father was a painter for the Public Buildings Department and if you had an uncle who stayed each summer and played a folk guitar very softly and sang like Pete Seeger and if you had a mad, joyous aunty who played the accordion at raucous family gatherings and if the first live pop act you saw was an actual concert in a theatre with six acts and if the radio constantly played new songs all the time and if, as you grew, this seemed to slow and a sense of drag and inertia came with the sound and people looked back fondly at more exciting times and if this feeling extended to a few summers of strange, directionless nostalgia with TV shows about simple, neat and joyful wars that never ended and Ionesco-esque ?50s coffee bars, and if there was an actual, aberrant period when punk rock blew the lid on all this and exposed, so very briefly, a world of possibly nothing and if you then embarked on a life within that strange plane, that realm of illusory sound, and if that was a point of departure for seeming flight and if you then found yourself flying, however low, above a land which you had forgotten you were actually in that was quite familiar and the actual flight plans you had copied did not take account of local weather and terrain and fuel supplies and if you got caught up in some turbulence but still kept to some illusory constellations from your original cosmology (imported from afar) and you kept to that distant destination point and somehow ended up flying over and through some of that old-world atmosphere and even spent a lot of time on the ground and if, during all this time you had rarely, if ever, experienced a performance at an arena-sized venue or listened to commercial radio, and if you had done your best to remain neutral and a little outside the dominant culture, having a vague sense of the occult at work in all things and if you had never ever, even when you had qualified for admission, identified with youth culture and had later on been exposed to a governmental youth-directed broadcaster and found it to be all heavy panting and dry wanting and if you had lived long enough to see all this condensed and replayed and looped and distorted as if it was someone else&#8217;s experience and if you were then thrown out of orbit so wildly that you perceived things anew, as if the essential matter of your actual experience had been reduced and boiled down to a grey pulp which lay cold, watery and stinking between your naked toes and the bare cement of the compound you were suddenly aware of and if you know that at the beginning there was a sense of a monolithic, unknowable and excitedly blind and murmuring mob and that this had been smashed and cajoled into a thousand dead, drifting asteroids oblivious to the whole and that you sometimes felt yourself to be rather like Donald Sutherland in *Invasion of the Bodysnatchers</em>, as the pods and the host bodies willed themselves to enjoy their own emasculation and shame as they were driven to dry ecstasies by ever-newer and better and more rootless storms of nostalgia and impossible resurrections of dead events of time and space from deep in someone else&#8217;s mediated reality and you felt, helplessly, the probes and feinting strikes into your own interior by tongues unknown and then became aware of your own voice and self-image as a figure stalking the world while you slept, saying shit you would never say, giving you the sudden sense of a lifetime of unease within the very atmosphere you swim through, while having developed the habit of drawing strength from arcane literature and music and in general being outcast and wandering, not stoned and not deranged but cool and collected and always somehow removed yet, like everybody, feeling the shadow of the Leviathan that walks beside us all and grows stronger every day, and if you had read HP Lovecraft talking of being ?the crawling chaos, talking to the audient void?, then you would be me. And you would make music like I do in the early 21st century.</p>
