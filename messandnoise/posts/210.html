                <h3>Ahead of a joint three week tour up Australia&#8217;s east coast, BERKFINGER from Sydney&#8217;s Philadelphia Grandy Jury, Melbourne&#8217;s MEGAN WASHINGTON and KANE MAZLIN from Brisbane&#8217;s Hungry Kids of Hungary, sit down for some trilateral talks.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3003288/440x660-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="660"/><br/>
<strong>Berkfinger:  What are you doing right now?</strong></p>
<p>Washington: I&#8217;m sitting at Gate 6 in Sydney airport waiting to get on a plane to go home to Melbourne. I just got into an argument with some wintry miserable bitches at check-in about my excess baggage (my keyboard). You know Qantas allow extra weight for sports people but not for musicians? Lame. </p>
<p>Kane: I&#8217;m fiddling with my mobile phone as it keeps mysteriously turning off. It&#8217;s giving me great amounts of anxiety. I also made some really strong drip coffee this afternoon at work, so that could explain my nerves. Other than that I was just looking at the sky, but it&#8217;s not going to storm.</p>
<p><strong>B: What was it like to hear your song on triple j?</strong></p>
<p>W: It strangely sounds better on radio than on anything else we&#8217;ve ever played it on. The power of FM radio is limitless. Still, every time I hear it, I feel a little bit nervous like a kid&#8217;s mother at an eisteddfod. Like it&#8217;s going to get stage fright and vomit on another kid in a tutu standing right beside it.</p>
<p>K: It was kinda weird cause Caroline Tran played a demo of ours on [triple j&#8217;s] <em>Home &amp; Hosed</em>, and as it was ringing out she started introducing another track and got a little bit of fright cause we&#8217;d left a tambourine hitting the ground really loud about three secs after the song finished. She made a little ?eeek!? noise and went really quiet. It probably wasn&#8217;t that funny, but I laughed out loud.</p>
<p><strong>B: Do your parents approve of rock&#8217;n?roll?</strong></p>
<p>W: My dad is the best fucking yodeler this side of the alps. I&#8217;m not joking. This has nothing to do with rock&#8217;n?roll, but I just wanted to share it. </p>
<p>K: My dad loves his rock&#8217;n?roll, but his favourite question is how many hits have I had on MySpace today [<em>laughs</em>]. I seriously crack up when he says that &#8211; They ask me more questions about work and job interviews though which bites.</p>
<p><strong>B: Which show are you most looking forward to on the International Relations Tour?</strong></p>
<p>K: I&#8217;m most looking forward to the Melbourne show. We haven&#8217;t played down there yet and are quite excited to finally be able to go down. You guys reckon we should learn some cover song to play together at the end? What about [John Lennon&#8217;s] ?Instant Karma?? Double drum attack. Yeh!</p>
<p>W: Double drum attack? Triple drum attack!  </p>
<p><strong>B: Where, when and in what format can we buy your shit?</strong></p>
<p>W: You can buy EPs at gigs and on iTunes, and you can buy shirts at gigs. The shirts are special because we sleep on them when I can&#8217;t afford tour accom, so they&#8217;re all lightly seasoned with Washington drool.</p>
<p>K: We&#8217;ll have a brand new EP for this tour. We may even have some T-shirts too. Mega! I can&#8217;t wait to play with you Phily J boys, it&#8217;s gonna be a hoot. We&#8217;ve played with Washington a couple times now and she rules. Together we could learn to love again.</p>
<p><strong>K: Do you drink coffee and are you addicted?</strong></p>
<p>B: Once. Tastes like shit, costs lots of money, makes you thirsty. Great. I am addicted to eBay, however.</p>
<p>W: Yes and yes. Washo&#8217;s handy hint: when travelling to regional towns where the quality of the coffee is questionable, bring some chocolate covered coffee beans to munch on. It keeps those caffeine cravings at bay and there&#8217;s no need to drink the creepy stuff from the servo. </p>
<p><strong>K: Any plans to release a full-length this year?</strong></p>
<p>B: Yes, in September, but first I have to finish the vocals. I have been singing in my bed under a blanket lately, which sounds great but involves a lot of breaks as it gets pretty sweaty after 15 minutes in there.</p>
<p>W: We&#8217;ll be releasing a mini-album soon.</p>
<p><strong>K: Megan, how do you get your eyes to be so blue? And Berkfinger, what colour are your eyes? I cannot tell from MySpace.</strong></p>
<p>W: Kane, man, you know I love your guts but there is no possible way I can answer this question without sounding like a complete tool. </p>
<p>B: My eyes are blue but like Howard Moon they are quite small so it is often difficult to tell.</p>
<p><strong>K: Who will be the loudest band on tour (on stage and off stage)?</strong></p>
<p>B: I am guessing Hungary Kids of Hungary on both counts because they are from Brisbane and everyone from Brisbane is crazy.</p>
<p>W: I would like to see the Philly Jays in some Tom Arnold-style loud Hawaiian shirts complete with baggy shorts and those reef shoes that Swedish backpackers wear when they&#8217;ve run out of Birkenstocks. That would make them the loudest band both onstage and offstage.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3003289/440x457-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="457"/><br/>
<strong>W: Worst thing you have ever done onstage?</strong></p>
<p>K: Haven&#8217;t really done anything bad or naughty. Lots of unnecessary mumbling. Actually, I have a very real problem that I have a team of smart people looking into: Microphone-Tooth Collision. I have a terrible case of this. Every show I smash my front teeth so damn hard. Benny [Dalton, bass player] even blogged about it.</p>
<p>B: Well, Kane will be happy to know that I have actually permanently chipped all of my front teeth by putting an SM58 Microphone all the way in my mouth so I could sing while using both of my hands to break our keyboard, which is still broken.</p>
<p><strong>W: Which musician would you turn for and why?</strong></p>
<p>K: Maybe the singer from Phantom Planet. He&#8217;s a bit alright. My sister told me to say that, by the way.</p>
<p>B: Maybe Jon Spencer if he would just cut his hair and look after himself a bit more, you know? My heroes are getting old and unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>W: Hungries, tell us ?all we need to know? in one sentence.</strong></p>
<p>K: All you need to know is that you should come along to one of the International Relations tour dates cause there will be so much joy and happiness. And weirdness.</p>
<p><strong>W: Phillys, did you really go to the casino? And, if you did, what did you play? And, did you win anything, and how much?</strong></p>
<p>B: The time when I was writing that song [?Going To The Casino Tomorrow Night? was Crown in Melbourne. I dropped all my food money, which was a measly $50, on blackjack. $50 up and $40 down. The best one was when I convinced the Crustaceans, who I played drums for, to put $500 that was won in a band contest on the roulette wheel. The big thing went around and then the nice Filipino lady took all of our chips away with her plastic stick.</p>
<p><strong>W: What would you name your Christmas album?</strong></p>
<p>K: It would be called <em>Feed Me Beigli Pie Mummy!</em>. A traditional Hungarian Christmas eve is not complete without Beigli</p>
<p>B: <em>Berkfinger Does E.T And A Can Of Beer Alone In Surry Hills, 2007.</em></p>
<p><strong>B: Craziest fan that you have dealt with?</strong></p>
<p>W: Okay, this is a difficult question to answer because I actually do have a couple of crazy fans. In the event that I start listing their various shenanigans and misdemeanors, they will inevitably discover this and it could quite possibly spur them on to be even more crazy stuff, because they realise what a deep and lasting impact they have on my life. My mother does deserve an honorable mention. She would be classified in crazy fan territory had she not given me the gift of bloody, screaming life.</p>
<p>K: We don&#8217;t have any crazy fans &#8230; yet. Damn it! I hope we get some soon.</p>
<p><strong>B: How do you deal with sweaty clothing on tour? Any laundry strategies you can share?</strong></p>
<p>W: I have not done any washing in about three months. I have about 70 pairs of underwear (this is not a lie, my housemate can confirm this). Therefore I can do quarterly loads of washing (often coincides with my APRA statement) and in the meantime I travel with a bottle of Febreze. That shit is amazing.</p>
<p>K: I just put them in a plastic bag, seal it and walk away. I take a ridiculous amount of cheap, crappy shirts on tour.</p>
<p><strong>B: Got a crush on anyone in your band?</strong></p>
<p>W: I have crushes on every member of my band, as well as the Philly Jays and Hungry Kids. I do not discriminate.</p>
<p>K: Totally jealous of [guitarist] Dean [McGrath&#8217;s] new haircut. His hair is straight and shapely where mine is thick and unkempt. So, yeah, I guess I have a crush.</p>
<p><strong>B: Are you an alcoholic yet?</strong></p>
<p>W: I think I&#8217;m borderline. We should revisit these questions at the end of the tour and see if the experience affects our answers.</p>
<p>K: The last few months I have been buying cartons instead of six packs to kinda ultimately save money. So, yeah, I guess an addiction is starting to take shape.</p>
<p><strong>B: Have you ever been electrocuted?</strong></p>
<p>W: I once had a job as one of those people who goes into shopping centres before Christmas and installs all those trashy tinsel displays and gigantic Christmas trees and Santa&#8217;s workshop stalls etc. You start at like 8pm and work until 8am when the stores open again, so by the time it gets to about 3am, you&#8217;re really really really tired and lose concentration. I zapped myself on countless fairy light strings. They are a hazard. A glittering, sentimental hazard. I possibly shortened my life expectancy.</p>
<p>K: No, but I have been smashed in the temple by a gold club. I had to go to hospital for a little while.</p>

<strong>K: Do you have or any of your band members have tinnitus?</strong><br/>
B: My ears ring slightly when I lay in bed alone at night. I had an original, extremely loud Sony Walkman when I was a kid you see.</p>
<p><strong>K: How many songs have you written this year?</strong></p>
<p>B: This year? Probably five to 10. Last year, maybe 15. </p>
<p><strong>K: Do you have a favourite local band in your home town?</strong><br/>
B: I really dig Deep Sea Arcade. They are gonna be big. I also love The Statics, who probably never will be.</p>
<p><strong>W: Name the best guitar solo of all time.</strong></p>
<p>K: ?November Rain?, of course. </p>
<p>B: Jesus, I hate all forms of solo. Maybe in ?Mind? by Talking Heads.</p>
<p><strong>W: What is the first song you ever remember hearing?</strong></p>
<p>K: I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s Paul Simon&#8217;s ?Graceland?.</p>
<p>B: ?What&#8217;s New Pussycat? as sung by my mother. Whoa ah whoa whoooaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>W: What&#8217;s the worst band name you have ever heard?</strong></p>
<p>K: Natalie Portman&#8217;s Shaved Head. I saw it on some worst band names website a while back.</p>
<p>B: The Menstruation Sisters were awesome and I don&#8217;t want to here another bad word about them! DJ Smallcock used to bounce on an amplified trampoline while wielding a chainsaw. I heard last time he played he was cut short because he had to go to hospital.</p>
<p><strong>W: What did you do the first time you heard the <em>White Album</em>?</strong></p>
<p>K: I heard it when I was quite young so I don&#8217;t remember really. I did not hear it for many years after that to be honest. I think it made me a bit agitated last time I listened, but I love it.</p>
<p>B: Quit the funk band I was in and started working at a recording studio.</p>
