                <h3>Over the past two years, Melbourne&#8217;s Love of Diagrams have endured the highs and lows of being signed and later dumped by Matador, only to emerge with the finest album of their career. <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> reports.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005691/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Revenge for Love of Diagrams is feedback-drenched, disarming and anything but sweet. After being shown the door by Matador after one album &#8211; 2007?s hastily recorded <em>Mosaic* &#8211; the Melbourne trio have responded in perfect fashion &#8211; by making *Nowhere Forever</em>, the best record the venerable US indie never released.  </p>
<p>?I&#8217;m hoping they hear it and regret their hasty decision,? jokes singer/guitarist Luke Horton, his wry laugh concealing the sense of bitter disappointment the band felt after Matador pulled the plug shortly after <em>Mosaic</em>?s release. The band had been signed on the strength of a South by Southwest showcase in 2006 &#8211; yes, these things really do happen &#8211; but failed to meet the lofty targets set by the label that once counted Pavement and Teenage Fanclub among its roster of indie elite.</p>
<p>?They made it pretty clear, almost immediately after we made <em>Mosaic</em>, that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to put out the next one. It was very disappointing. It made us angry with them. We sort of felt like they had been misleading about the whole thing.</p>
<p>?It was frustrating,? Horton continues. &#8220;We might have approached the whole thing a little differently if they made it clear that if the record didn&#8217;t sell a certain amount, they weren&#8217;t going to be able to put out the next one. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have been interested in that idea.?</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005693/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
In truth, meeting Matador&#8217;s lofty expectations was always going to be an uphill climb. Despite a fervent local fanbase &#8211; cultivated upon a fearsome live show and 2003?s all-instrumental debut <em>The Target Is You</em> &#8211; Love of Diagrams had little in the way of an international profile by the time the label came calling. They spent the majority of 2007 relentlessly touring the US, effectively making up for lost time. ?That was frustrating playing those songs over and over again, night after night,? Horton recalls. ?It was frustrating that we couldn&#8217;t write new material, so when we came back [to Australia] I did a lot of home recording.?</p>
<p>In contrast to <em>Mosaic*, which was cut in eight days at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago, *Nowhere Forever</em> was painstakingly put together over six months on Horton&#8217;s four-track. The band experimented with different sounds and textures, literally layering songs from the ground up. ?There were lots of ideas and they came very quickly. We wrote this record in a very different way than we have before. We were getting into recording at home, building the songs up as a recording process, rather than writing a song, playing it live and then recording it.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?Monika got her work done in a couple days, Antonia did two [weeks], so they were both sitting around for a week, hanging out in the hot tub in the garden while I was laboriously trying to get the sounds that I wanted.?</p></blockquote>
<p>With fully formed demos in tow, Loved of Diagrams headed to Bear Creek Studios on the outskirts of Seattle to record the album proper with producer Ryan Hadlock (Gossip, Blonde Redhead, Steve Malkmus). The studio &#8211; a converted barn situated on a 10-acre horse farm &#8211; was built in the ?70s by Hadlock&#8217;s father Joe, who still lives in the farmhouse across the road. But despite the relaxed surrounds &#8211; ?It&#8217;s got that slightly hippie utopian vibe to it,? Horton explains, ?a really picturesque beautiful place with decaying teepees in the garden? &#8211; the band were still up against it from the moment they stepped through the door.</p>
<p>?By the time we got to Bear Creek to make it, the demos were incredibly layered, textured sounds that we had to try and reproduce in the studio in three weeks,? explains Horton. ?That was the challenging part: how are we going to reproduce something we created in six months at home in three weeks? It was a much longer time to spend on a record than we&#8217;ve ever spent before, but we still felt quite rushed.?</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005689/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Much of that challenge fell to Horton, who had the unenviable task of recreating the demo&#8217;s wall of guitars while drummer Monika Fikerle and bassist/vocalist Antonia Sellbach made the most of Bear Creek&#8217;s resort-like facilities. ?Monika got her work done in a couple days, Antonia did two [weeks], so they were both sitting around for a week, hanging out in the hot tub in the garden while I was laboriously trying to get the sounds that I wanted,? he jokes. ?Sometimes I was trying to reproduce the stuff I had done on the demos &#8211; things I was really happy with &#8211; while other times I was looking for new sounds.?</p>
<p>The album is awash with woozy guitar interludes and effects such as tremolo and wah; an unconscious nod, Horton says, to Loop, Dinosaur Jr, Swervedriver and other formative bands of his youth. <em>Nowhere Forever</em> is also a throwback to the band&#8217;s instrumental days, but with a keener ear for melody and a more refined pop sound. </p>
<p>?I think we&#8217;ve gotten better at writing songs,? says Horton, pointing at the album&#8217;s liner notes, which credit individual songwriters, as a measure of how far they&#8217;ve come. They&#8217;ve also gotten a lot better, he says, at integrating vocals into their hazy, guitar-driven sound. ?Antonia&#8217;s got a great voice, but it took me a bit longer to work it out. I&#8217;m really pleased with the way the vocals and the guitars balance out on this one.?</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3005694/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The challenge now, says Horton, is working out a way to take their dense new sound on the road. With a national album launch in September and a US tour mooted for early 2010, Horton has flirted with adding a second guitarist to their ranks. ?Not permanently or anything,? he qualifies, ?but for the album launches, maybe getting someone else to play. I think we&#8217;re pulling it off [as a three-piece], but it would be nice, for instance, when I go from playing the rhythm part to the melody or the wah part, if the rhythm track didn&#8217;t disappear.?</p>
<p>He also says the band&#8217;s sporadic appearances over the years has worked in their favour. The band now splits their time between Love of Diagrams and a host of extraneous activities: Selbach is in Beaches, Fikerle plays with Baseball and Horton moonlights in local ?supergroup? Scott &amp; Charlene&#8217;s Wedding on top of studying a PhD at Melbourne University.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005690/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
?After you work very intensely on something, like making a record &#8211; and it was an intense experience &#8211; it&#8217;s nice to have a break from the band and each other,? he says. ?But it&#8217;s never got to the point when it&#8217;s become an issue. Whenever we&#8217;ve wanted to regroup, we&#8217;ve always found the time to do that.?</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><em>Nowhere Forever</em> is out August 21 on Unstable Ape/Remote Control. It&#8217;ll be launched in Melbourne at the Northcote Social Club on September 11, Sydney&#8217;s Annandale Hotel on September 17 and at Jade Monkey in Adelaide on October 2.</p>
