                <h3><strong>MATT SHEA<em>* survives an eventful first day of Brisbane music industry conference BIGSOUND, which features a ?controversial? keynote from Alan McGee and performances by Adalita, Street Chant, Brous and Mike Noga. Additions by **DARREN LEVIN**, photos by *</em>ELLENI TOUMPAS</strong>.
</h3>
<h2>Wednesday, September 7: Day</h2>
<p>Brisbane&#8217;s Fortitude Valley can be an unsightly place during the day, and as I make my way up the hill to the Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts I think about how much money has flowed into the area since it was declared an entertainment precinct and how little of that cash has been spent on actually improving anything. Still, the tightly woven patchwork of venues is perfect for an event like BIGSOUND, which draws its delegates into the ?Judy? during the day for a wide range of seminars and keynotes, before spraying them outward at 5pm each evening for an endless series of parties and showcases.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>The first event on this year&#8217;s schedule is a keynote with <strong>Alan McGee</strong> &#8211; label owner of Creation Records in the ?90s and then Poptones from 1999 to 2007, but perhaps better known as the manager for both Primal Scream and Oasis in their respective heydays. It&#8217;s a boon for the conference to have someone of McGee&#8217;s stature open the proceedings, and its entertaining to watch him talk frankly to <em>The Australian</em>?s Iain Shedden about drugs, the Gallagher brothers, more drugs, and his obvious man-love for Bobby Gillespie (who he refers to, simply as ?Gillespie?). </p>
<p>But at a certain point, McGee&#8217;s honesty gets the better of him, and when he starts making statements such as, ?I don&#8217;t like music?, ?Music doesn&#8217;t define me?, ?I find musicians boring? and ?I&#8217;m not interested in music?, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the steam beginning to creep out of executive programmer Graham Ashton&#8217;s ears. There&#8217;s a noticeable sagging of the atmosphere around me, as the bubbly youngsters who&#8217;d arrived at the conference barely an hour earlier, tablets and laptops at the ready (one guy had an iPad AND a MacBook), have their dreams stomped on by the straight-talking Scot. It would turn out to be one of the most entertaining parts of BIGSOUND 2011, but its suitability as an opening keynote remains questionable. (The debate among delegates about McGee&#8217;s performance slowly turns into barely-disguised hostility as the conference wears on.)</p>

<p/>
<p>At 11am things get underway proper with ?The Future Is Now?, which looks at the ways people consume media in 2011 and how that affects the music business. A well-balanced panel and some sharp work from chair Paul Barclay help leaven a potentially dry topic. I come away from this admiring anybody who wants to get into the music delivery business because the options for failure seem endless, although Toolshed CEO Dick Huey really nails it when he comments that music is shifting from being a product to being a service. </p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>This panel is the first of innumerable times over the next few days that I&#8217;ll hear <strong>Spotify<em>* mentioned, but perhaps the most curious delivery method presented on the panel today is *</em>Guvera</strong>, a free music service where advertising linked to the downloads supposedly puts money in the pockets of artists. It sounds to me like a pile of magic beans but the service has been in operation for over a year now, and foppish representative Fady Hanna toes a convincing line on how successful it&#8217;s all been. I&#8217;m not sure if the company caught the t-shirt craze a few years ago, and I wouldn&#8217;t mind betting Hanna and co. don&#8217;t always fit in with the ideals of history&#8217;s coolest socialist, but they&#8217;re trying to pay musicians and that can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>Just before lunch, Rebekah Campbell runs us through her <strong>Posse</strong> social marketing scheme. She begins by asking the question, ?What does an Evermore fan look like?? (answer: a bit of a dork, actually) and then talks about the advent of her business model, where she essentially entrusts music fans to actively promote their favourite bands. It actually seems like a bit of a masterstroke, and in just 10 minutes Campbell provides one of the most compelling little presentations of the entire three-day event.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>The afternoon sessions kick off with ?The Future Of Radio?, a panel chaired by ABC Radio&#8217;s Kellie Riordan. I go into this hoping for a compelling narrative on how the arrogant radio gods are being torn asunder by the brave new digital world, but every young band probably should have been packed into the tiny room on the Judy&#8217;s upper floor, such was the practicality of the information being dished about. I guess it helps when the panelists are excellent. The laidback nature of both XFM&#8217;s Mike Walsh and the BBC&#8217;s Jen Long dispels with the idea that radio execs and presenters are self-serious assholes, while BFM Digital&#8217;s Heather Badower sums up the current environment well when she describes radio in 2011 as being part of a patchwork of different marketing techniques for up-and-coming bands. To underline the usefulness of the panel, it has a heavy focus on community radio, with AMRAP&#8217;s Chris Johnson demonstrating the organisation&#8217;s AirNet project, which aims to bridge the gap between community radio play and online promotions. The verdict from this session: radio (and community radio in particular) isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

<p/>
<p>The final event for the day is a Q&amp;A with Warner Music&#8217;s <strong>Tony Harlow<em>*. Harlow&#8217;s had a productive career both in Australia and in his native England and comes across as a stand-up gent, and </em>The Daily Telegraph&#8217;s</strong> Kathy McCabe&#8217;s a gifted interviewer, but the alarm bells ring early when the two of them walk on stage carrying a bottle of red wine. The conversation is hampered by a stilted intimacy that at times drifts toward the self-indulgent, and more than a few bored delegates seek solace in their smart phones or simply give up, wandering out of the theatre in the direction of the nearest pub. Perhaps it would have worked better if it wasn&#8217;t somebody who knew Harlow so well, or perhaps Harlow is just a bit more introverted than you&#8217;d expect, but I don&#8217;t think the drawn-out Desert Island Discs format helps either. There are a few gems divvied out at the end for those still paying attention, and Harlow&#8217;s outfit is entertaining enough on its own (two-tone shoes and a navy blue shirt with white poker dots), but I wish I&#8217;d cut my losses a little earlier. </p>

<h2>Night</h2>
<p>After all that talking, it&#8217;s a relief to finally see some music. First up is a trip to a New Zealand-themed party to check out who the Kiwi music commission have dragged from across the Tasman. <strong>Tiny Ruins</strong> is first up, Hollie Fullbrook strapping on her acoustic guitar and delivering a set built from her impressive debut LP, <em><a href="/releases/2000907">Some Were Meant For Sea</a></em>, Fullbrook&#8217;s got a subtle yet undeniable presence and honeysweet voice, but her intricate lyrics are lost somewhat on a furtive industry crowd, the weirdly high stage not helping with the disconnect.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3023333/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Next up is the punk rock of Auckland&#8217;s <strong>Street Chant</strong>. Their debut album, <em>Means</em>, has turned more than a few heads and they take to their work tonight with admirable gusto, but it&#8217;s hard for this fresh-faced young band to get on top of the standoffish crowd. I do enjoy drummer Alex Brown&#8217;s vigorous series of warm-ups, though. When frontwoman Emily Littler lies on the floor at the foot of the stage and starts hammering away on her guitar, I take it as my cue to leave.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how many people you can possibly fit on the stage at The Zoo, the answer would seem to be about 10. That said, and as ridiculous as they sometimes look, Brisbane&#8217;s <strong>Inland Sea</strong> handle their numbers pretty well. There&#8217;s the odd occasion where too much is going on sonically, but it says a lot that these guys display a chemistry usually associated with bands half their size. There&#8217;s some enjoyable new material to take in tonight, but the crowd moves most to ?Traitor?, the elegant minor anthem taken from last year&#8217;s EP of the same name.</p>

<p>DL: After a couple event fails &#8211; I catch Melbourne&#8217;s <strong>Brous<em>* as she&#8217;s winding up the last few seconds of fantastic new single <a href="/tv/4289253">?Steamers?</a> and miss Sydney noise mongers **The Laurels** after getting lost on the way to The Aviary &#8211; I catch my first band of the night, *</em>Boy In A Box</strong>, at the Bakery Lane outdoor stage. The latest in the line of ?boy? bands (I call them Boy In A Bear accidentally/on purpose for the rest of the night), they&#8217;re playing tight, loud and earnestly to a big crowd. Frontman Tobias Priddle has his hair slicked back and his sleeves rolled up like a rockabilly <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005098/">Chris Klein</a>, but they&#8217;d be a far more attractive proposition if they weren&#8217;t so indebted to The Gaslight Anthem. ?Moon Comes Up? is an excellent single, and one of the few occasions they don&#8217;t sound like a certain band from Jersey. I blame Springsteen.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet this is the first time <strong>Adalita</strong> has played at a venue that will soon host a Parklife ?rehab? party and a French DJ renowned for remixing Fatboy Slim. Someone tells me that Electric Playground is the kind of place that won&#8217;t let you in based on your shoes, and it&#8217;s not really suited to an intimate set of personal, and sometimes hushed material. Adalita, however, is mesmerising &#8211; even though I&#8217;m struggling to find a vantage point from which to see her (the stage is sunken and a late arrival means I&#8217;m confined to the back). JP Shilo provides some tasteful backing on guitar and violin, and ?The Repairer? and ?Hot Air? are powerful in their vulnerability. A <a href="/news/4313210">Meredith</a> sundowner surely beckons?</p>

<p>MS: The Tempo Hotel is home of the world&#8217;s stickiest carpet (it&#8217;s like being on ketamine, only without the euphoria, or the cramps, or the urinary tract infection). The Tempo tonight seems to be catering for the more beat-driven artists, and it&#8217;s a good place to hang for an hour, taking in both <strong>Sietta<em>* and *</em>Thundamentals</strong>. Elefant Traks have been putting a lot of resources behind Sietta and it&#8217;s easy to see why &#8211; the Darwin-based duo of James Mangohig and Caiti Baker punch well above their weight on record, but that&#8217;s even more the case in the live setting. Baker&#8217;s vocals and Mangohig&#8217;s beats both play with and push each other, and by the time they close with current single ?What Am I Supposed To Do?? they&#8217;ve won more than a couple of converts.</p>
<p>It also acts as nice little primer for <strong>Thundamentals</strong>, one of classiest hip-hop acts in Australia right now. This is my first time seeing this Blue Mountains-via-Sydney crew live and they don&#8217;t in any way under-deliver. They&#8217;re tight, charismatic, and bring some monster beats, peppering a willing mob with both favourites from the 2009 <em>LP Sleeping On Your Style*, as well as the slightly more challenging material taken from their brand new release *Foreverlution</em>. Great stuff.</p>
<p>DL: No surprises Brisbane&#8217;s big-man-on-campus <strong>Ben Salter<em>* is playing at The Black Bear Lodge. It&#8217;s on the site of the <a href="/articles/4127022">sadly defunct</a> Troubadour, and he effectively <a href="/articles/4126991">lived there</a>. Wearing a t-shirt spruiking HITS &#8211; a Brisbane rock&#8217;n?roll institution that&#8217;ll never ?showcase? here &#8211; Salter is in fine form, playing songs from his recently released debut solo album *<a href="/releases/2000912">The Cat</a>*. Hearing ?West End Girls? (a titular nod to the Pet Shop Boys that&#8217;s more in line with ?Southtown Girls? by The Hold Steady) in its city of origin is a highlight, as is the sweaty muscle provided by his instrument-swapping backing trio. (I swear the mustachioed drummer served me a drink earlier in the night.) The set ends with probably the best cover of Guided By Voices? ?Teenage FBI? ever played; a stalling tactic for the late-arriving *</em>Lanie Lane</strong>. (Cut her a break: she just <a href="/news/4319596">recorded with Jack White</a>.)</p>
<p>MS: Black Bear is a narrow hothouse and it&#8217;s packed tonight, making me flip open my notebook and write, ?Hope this place doesn&#8217;t catch on fire.? The chances of that happening perhaps increase as florist-turned-singer Lane takes to the stage. She&#8217;s absolutely electric, and I sense the pupils dilating around me as a mesmerised crowd draw ever closer to the singer-guitarist. Lane&#8217;s old-school Americana shtick very narrow, but there&#8217;s a formidable presence on display here and I make a note to check out her album when it comes up for release in October.</p>

<p>DL: I settle in to the hallway-like front bar of notorious Valley institution Ric&#8217;s for a nice musical nightcap: <strong>Amaya Laucirica<em>* followed by The Drones? **Mike Noga</em></strong>. Laucirica is playing songs from last year&#8217;s stunning *<a href="/releases/2000784">Early Summer</a> LP backed by the ever-adaptable JP Shilo, who spends most of the gig hunched over a violin. She cuts a diminutive figure in her sequined dress, and yet somehow manages to drown out the horrible ?90s pop music from next door (I&#8217;m sure I heard ?Barbie Girl? at one point). There&#8217;s a purity about Laucirica&#8217;s delivery that cuts through the cacophony outside, and she switches from guitar to keyboard for ?This World Can Make You Happy?, providing one of the few transportive moments of the night. She should be huge.</p>

<p>Mike Noga follows, but not after some quibbles about the tinny sound. Gun Street Girls? Callum John-Barter makes a few tweaks, and he&#8217;s away, playing songs from his second solo album <em><a href="/releases/2000866">The Balladeer Hunter</a></em> backed by a local violinist. Noga is a great singer and lyricist, and like his bandmate Gareth Liddiard, a hilariously acerbic fucker to boot. (Is this a prerequisite for joining The Drones?) He makes running jokes about being scouted by A&amp;Rs, rightly lays into the venue next door, and sums up the BIGSOUND Live experience as ?a whole lot of bands doing infomercials?. Ben Salter shares a mic with him for ?All My Friends Are Alcoholics?, and the night appropriately ends with a drunken singalong.</p>
