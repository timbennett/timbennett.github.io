                <h3>From following his own muse in the studio to forging ahead with a brave pop sound, Liam Finn has transcended his famous surname to emerge as a talent in his own right. Speaking from his father&#8217;s Roundhead Studios in Auckland, he tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> about his new recording philosophy and why he&#8217;s relishing the chance to win over Pearl Jam&#8217;s one-eyed fans.

?I want people to doubt me, and then I have to prove myself.? Liam Finn isn&#8217;t talking about the pains of being the child of a famous musician, but the challenge of pushing himself outside his comfort zone: on breakfast TV, where his loop pedal tomfoolery has seen him unfairly cast as a sideshow, and on an upcoming tour with Pearl Jam, whose merciless fans have a reputation for giving support acts the middle finger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true, he&#8217;s the son of a Finn brother &#8211; we&#8217;ll let you guess which one &#8211; but aside from a shared love of harmony and a softly-spoken North Island accent, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter is very much his own man. In our half-hour interview, we barely touch on his famous dad &#8211; OK, it&#8217;s Neil &#8211; not because it&#8217;s a taboo subject, but because it overshadows the musical strides Finn junior has made of late. His new EP <em>Champagne In Seashells* continues the experimental pop excursions started on debut album *I&#8217;ll Be Lightning</em> (2007), which in turn introduced a very different side to the precocious teen who jammed out his alterna-rock fantasies in Betchadupa. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s also spent the past month cranking out an album with new band <a href="/news/3732159">Havin A Baby</a>, which features co-conspirator Eliza-Jane Barnes (daughter of Jimmy) and fellow Kiwis Lawrence Arabia, Connan Mockasin and Seamus Ebbs. He&#8217;s also about to hit the road for a short run of dates before upcoming tours with Pearl Jam and Wilco.</p>
<p><strong>So what drives such a rigorous touring ethic?</strong><br/>
The more success you generate, the more opportunities come up. There&#8217;s more demand for touring [now] and I guess I&#8217;ve got a problem with saying no [<em>laughs*]. There were quite a few years there after Betchadupa when I was sitting around in London and feeling a little bit lost, like I wasn&#8217;t doing anything. But once [debut album] *I&#8217;ll Be Lightning</em> was recorded and then the touring started, I was quite happy for it to go on and on. That in a way, turned into a perpetual thing. Like I said, the more you do, the more people want you to do. I&#8217;m really enjoying it. I&#8217;ve had a bit more time off this year to build up the passion and the want to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>I guess when bands like Pearl Jam and Wilco come calling, you don&#8217;t really say no either.</strong><br/>
Exactly, yeah. This year has been amazing with the shows we&#8217;ve done so far, and it&#8217;ll be great to play with Wilco and Pearl Jam.</p>
<p><strong>What audience do you think you&#8217;re more suited to?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d definitely say Wilco. But Eddie [Vedder] has been a close friend for a long time and I grew up listening to Pearl Jam, so that&#8217;ll be an exciting tour. The challenge to play to Pearl Jam&#8217;s fans will be exciting too. I&#8217;ve done quite a few solo tours with Eddie and they were great, because I think his audience are expecting something a bit different, and he gets to reinvent himself as well. But I&#8217;ve seen so many support bands for Pearl Jam get the middle finger and everyone yelling at them. But I think what E-J [Eliza-Janes Barnes] and I do is so different to what the usual Pearl Jam support acts would do, that maybe they&#8217;d be startled into giving us a chance. And, at the very least, I know how to make a lot of noise, so I&#8217;ll hopefully drown them out [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>I think I saw Shudder To Think open for them sometime in the ?90s, and that was a total disaster.</strong><br/>
Oh, I&#8217;ve seen terrible reactions from New Zealand crowds. I mean, in New Zealand it&#8217;ll be fine, because they know who I am, but in Australia it&#8217;ll definitely be quite interesting. But I&#8217;m looking forward to it. I like the energy it creates. In a way, I like trying to win over people more. Playing to a room full of your fans is fantastic, it&#8217;s a great feeling because you get so much energy from them. But playing to a room of people that don&#8217;t know who you are, or don&#8217;t want you to be there, is even a greater challenge.</p>
<p><strong>So I&#8217;m guessing the Wilco tour stems from your father&#8217;s ?7 Worlds Collide? project?</strong><br/>
Yeah, definitely. It would&#8217;ve been the kind of tour I would&#8217;ve really tried to get on &#8211; even without 7 Worlds Collide happening &#8211; because I love Wilco. But it definitely helps being friends with the band [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>In a funny way though, Wilco&#8217;s audience are reportedly just as intimidating.</strong><br/>
I think their audience are pretty open-minded people. The latter Wilco records are maybe a bit less experimental than the ones I connected to, like <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* and *A Ghost Is Born</em>, but I think that their audience would be open to people making interesting new music, and trying to do something different.</p>
<p><strong>Going back to 7 Worlds Collide, what was it like jamming with so many renowned musicians?</strong><br/>
It was really surreal and amazing. At first, it was very intimidating. I wasn&#8217;t freaked out or extra shy or anything like that, but I definitely had to find my place and where I stood. At first you&#8217;re like, ?Why would my opinion matter when you&#8217;ve got these people in the room??, but then you realise that everybody&#8217;s just as insecure. The best ideas came out of a few people bouncing ideas back and forth off, and all of a sudden a song was there and finished. All those insecurities kind of washed away pretty quickly for everyone, and we just enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. But there were definitely many moments when I took a step back and thought, ?Hang on a second, that&#8217;s Wilco recording, or that&#8217;s Johnny [Marr] playing guitar on my song.? But I think that&#8217;s what made the project so special &#8211; everyone felt like that. Johnny felt like that with Wilco or with Dad or with Ed O&#8217;Brien &#8211; and they all felt like that with each other. So there was a good amount of awe in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Your new EP <em>Champagne In Seashells</em> is the first time you&#8217;ve given Eliza-Jane equal billing, what took so long?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] Well, it&#8217;s the first thing we&#8217;ve properly collaborated on &#8211; she wasn&#8217;t on *I&#8217;ll Be Lightning</em>. Last year the tours were always ?Liam Finn and Eliza-Jane?, and she&#8217;s become such a huge party of my show that it was a natural evolution to include her in the next recording project. It was a welcome change from doing it all on my own. We really do have a great dynamic with how we work together. She was so fantastic in the way she sped things up for me, rounded things off, helped me finish lyrics and gave me a female opinion?</p>
<p>We really wanted to capture the spontaneous nature of our shows [in the studio] &#8211; the wildness and the danger of it. In the studio, every band is always complaining, ?How do we make it sound like we do live??, I&#8217;ve learnt that you just can&#8217;t. You need to make it a bit more psychedelic or just give it a really honest performance. E-J was great for that, and the last song on the EP was a song I wrote for E-J to sing. We wrote most of it [the EP] together, but this time I got to write with her in mind as well. I could write melodies that ordinarily I wouldn&#8217;t get away with, but she can make anything sound beautiful.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I set myself up in a little corner. I have the desk on one side, a remote with a record and play button on the other, a drum kit behind me and then my pedals. It was like this big circle where I could spin around and do anything.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How did the two of you meet?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve known her since our childhood because our parents met years ago, but we didn&#8217;t become close friends until Betchadupa were living in Australia. Whenever we were in Sydney, she&#8217;d cook us meals and take us out. When I was living in England I was coming home to record <em>I&#8217;ll Be Lightning*, and she was just moving over, so I sub-let her the room. When I came back she was singing with my flatmate&#8217;s band &#8211; Lawrence Arabia, who we just made the record with &#8211; and she just really blew me away. She was so great in that band that I feel guilty for poaching her off them [*laughs</em>]. </p>
<p>One show I was doing with them, I could all of a sudden hear a harmony and it really freaked me out &#8211; She&#8217;d obviously heard the songs a couple times before and got the sound guy to hook her up a mic. She was sitting on the side of the stage, out of sight of everyone, with a glass of whiskey and a microphone singing along. The next show I managed to get her on the stage with her glass of whiskey and the microphone, and from there she was my band. I couldn&#8217;t get rid of her, and I didn&#8217;t want to get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>Was it instant chemistry?</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. It just worked really well. To begin with, I was getting up there with no plan, no set-list, and that&#8217;s still what we do. That was the birth of the attitude of the whole thing, and she just fit into it perfectly. She&#8217;s such a natural performer, a natural harmoniser, and she&#8217;ll go wherever I want to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the recording process, because I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;d be a nightmare tracking something where you play all the instruments.</strong><br/>
I set myself up in a little corner. I have the desk on one side, a remote with a record and play button on the other, a drum kit behind me and then my pedals. It was like this big circle where I could spin around and do anything [<em>laughs</em>]. E-J is quite an accomplished engineer as well. She knows how to do it and she knows what sounds good too. Her being there helped speed things up.</p>
<p>Normally, I like to start songs with a straight-up performance &#8211; just the guitar and a voice. I really believe that the vocals are the most important thing to capture well, and the thing to base the song on. Quite a lot of people record the music first and do the vocals last. I can understand why that happens, but you play differently when you don&#8217;t have a vocal on there and you sometimes lose the nuances that you&#8217;d have if you were playing around the vocal. That&#8217;s pretty important in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Did you look at the EP as a transitional thing; a chance to experiment more, given it wasn&#8217;t a full release?</strong><br/>
I guess so. That was probably a huge part of why I decided to do an EP, just like making my first solo record was indulging [what was] in my own head, doing it how I wanted to do it and not feeling any pressure. By making an EP, it frees you of that second album thing. I just want to keep making first records, that&#8217;s my new philosophy. I made a first record with this band [Havin A Baby], the EP with E-J was a first, my solo record was a first, so next year when I make my next record, I just gotta make it feel like a first of something. Then you never have to deal with expectations or pre-conceptions of what you&#8217;re going to make.</p>

<strong>So it&#8217;s a precursor to a full-length release?</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally &#8211; I just want to keep new things coming out. I guess that&#8217;s what I like about EPs, potentially you can release one a year. Whereas an album &#8211; so much of your time is being taken up touring-wise &#8211; that they only get made every two or three years. I don&#8217;t think my record company would be into it, but I&#8217;d be happy to keep making EPs; do one a year and keep the ratio of touring to recording a bit more even.</p>
<p><strong>Well, Radiohead have just come out and said the album&#8217;s dead, so anything&#8217;s possible.</strong><br/>
Attention spans are definitely getting smaller. People are also downloading their favourite two or three tracks off a record &#8211; It&#8217;s quite a hard thing to make a whole record flow when you&#8217;ve got 12 or 13 songs. It&#8217;s like a set-list, you have to build a shape what&#8217;s gonna work for a good whole listen, and potentially people aren&#8217;t going to listen to it like you first intended. An EP feels like an easier thing to shape and also a more concise thing to listen to in one go.</p>
<p><strong>Your decision to record and produce yourself &#8211; are you wary about third-party involvement?</strong><br/>
Not really. I think that the best things come out of collaborations. Making this record with this band [Havin A Baby] at the moment, is proving that it&#8217;s really good. We&#8217;re working with an engineer [Seamus Ebbs] who&#8217;s another musician friend of mine and a really great songwriter. We&#8217;re probably underplaying him really just having him as an engineer. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve collaborated with someone on a recording level that I&#8217;ve felt comfortable with. He knows what sounds I want to create and what sounds I want to get. I&#8217;m probably going to get a lot of hate from engineers saying this [<em>laughs</em>], but that&#8217;s what held me back in the past from realising the sounds that I was trying to get. They [engineers] learn how to record and do things so well, that it loses some of the character. I hate the idea of, ?We&#8217;ll fix it in the mix?, or, ?We&#8217;ll make it sound like that when we mix it.? I like the idea of purposeful recording. It&#8217;s more inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Where&#8217;d you learn your engineering skills?</strong><br/>
While making <em>I&#8217;ll Be Lightning* [*laughs*]. I&#8217;ve been making demos for years and recording and I had the same problem &#8211; I was always happier with the demos. The demos on the second Betachadupa record [*Aiming For Your Head*] in my opinion are better than the record. I think that record sounds great and [producer] Nick Launay did a great job, but he made it a rock record. My demos sounded more like *I&#8217;ll Be Lightning</em>, it sounded like how I was hearing it in my head. It had a bit more character and bit more of a unique thing about it. To be unique, you need to just follow your gut instinct and follow your ears.</p>
<p><strong>So given that you recorded the EP in analog, were you splicing the tape yourself as well?</strong><br/>
I was a bit scared to do that [<em>laughs</em>]. I think I might learn how to do that next time, but this time I didn&#8217;t have to. I guess I like the idea of just playing it right. I hate the idea of Pro Tools &#8211; you can do multiple takes and cut it together, fix things and artificially create things. It&#8217;s so much quicker and less tedious to just play it right, rather than look at a computer and edit it right.</p>
<p><strong>So you do the loops in the studio live?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I make a lot of my sounds with the same set-up that I use live. Obviously, I get a bit more time to make the loop rather than live where people are watching me make the loop &#8211; If you had to listen to a loop being made [in the studio], you&#8217;d be like, ?What is this art music shit?? [<em>Laughs</em>]. So I guess it&#8217;s using the same technique but in a less obvious way. In a way I really like it, because you can&#8217;t tell what instrument has made the sound.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve accidentally seen you on breakfast TV a couple of times and the hosts are always in awe of the loops. Are you concerned about being perceived as a novelty act?</strong><br/>
I suppose so. I always hoped that it wasn&#8217;t just going to become a gimmick. But at the same time, it&#8217;s genuinely real. It&#8217;s risky and it&#8217;s ever-changing and the songs are ever-evolving because of us using the loop. But I think potentially you are a gimmick on a breakfast television show and in some ways I should question the people that got us doing that kind of shit. I don&#8217;t really think that&#8217;s a good way to launch my music, but at the same time, I do like going to places and them going [in a dopey voice], ?So you&#8217;re going to play the drums and the guitar. What do you need this bass amp for?? They&#8217;re always really confused. It&#8217;s the same part of me that&#8217;s looking forward to this Pearl Jam tour.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s been a constant progression from your early days with Betachadupa to where you are now. Do you think your need to find your own voice is driven at all by your background?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s never been a conscious thing, but subconsciously maybe. I&#8217;ve always had an urge to do something unique anyway. Growing up listening to Matador records in the ?90s, there was this underground scene of music where people were doing things differently and sounding completely unique. Pavement were such a unique-sounding band &#8211; I always had the desire to be one of those acts. Throughout the years with Betchadupa, I realised that you can&#8217;t force anything like that, it&#8217;s gotta be because you&#8217;ve found what you do naturally. Making my first solo record made me find what I do naturally and how I make music, attitude-wise at least.</p>
