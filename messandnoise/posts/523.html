                <h3>With a belly full of risotto and bags of enthusiasm, Freya Berkhout tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> that despite their recent acclaim, Sydney&#8217;s ky? got off to an ?abysmal? start.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3015396/440x620-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Freya Berkhout &#8211; one half of Sydney vocal duo ky? &#8211; has spent the best part of two interviews making risotto. By the time she calls me, she&#8217;s finished her first bowl. ?I had to multi-task,? she says, excitedly, which comes as no surprise to anyone who&#8217;s witnessed a ky? live show. On stage, Berkhout and bandmate Alyx Dennison pull off a kind of musical acrobatics, juggling glockenspiel, samplers, keys and percussion, all while attempting to sing in perfect harmony. When it works, the results are often sublime. When it doesn&#8217;t, as Berkhout explains, it&#8217;s difficult to cover up.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;re doing lots of things at the same time, and if it&#8217;s not clear, you can&#8217;t hear any of it. That&#8217;s why we get so nervous every time we play &#8211; you can really hear when we make a mistake.?</p>
<p>On record, the balance is just as delicate. With the help of engineer/producer Daniell Johnston &#8211; a Sydney Conservatorium-trained composer in his own right &#8211; the pair have funneled a myriad of layers and influences (from Bj&#8217;rk and Joanna Newsom to Welsh composer Karl Jenkins) into their self-titled debut. What emerges, however, is a clear, distinct voice.</p>
<p><strong>Where did you first meet?</strong><br/>
We met at uni. It was in an English course through a mutual friend &#8211; We soon realised we&#8217;d been to a lot of the same places. We&#8217;d been to the same concerts and did some state music stuff at the same time. We were bound to meet eventually. It just happened at uni.</p>
<p><strong>What uni and what were you studying?</strong><br/>
Sydney Uni [The University of Sydney]. I&#8217;m still currently doing Asian studies and Alyx was doing philosophy, but she&#8217;s since deferred and is focusing on band stuff. I&#8217;m going to be doing the same thing at the end of this semester.</p>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;re going to be doing the band thing full-time?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>And the name of the band comes out of Asian studies?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it does. It&#8217;s a Hindi word. It means ?why?. It&#8217;s supposed to have one dot above the ?u?, but they don&#8217;t have that on a computer, so we had to have an umlaut &#8211; even though it&#8217;s not right.</p>
<p><strong>The umlaut makes things a bit more metal.</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re thinking we might have to drop it soon, sadly. It looks like a little smiley face. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have an instant musical connection?</strong><br/>
Alyx came over to my house one evening and we decided to make brownies &#8211; normal brownies. [<em>Laughs</em>] We both knew that we were musically inclined &#8211; we both played each other a song and sang that night, but never really played together, I don&#8217;t know why. Nine months later, Alyx wanted to enter a Sydney Uni band comp. She had deferred by then and wanted to make it a bit more legitimate by playing with someone who was still at uni. She asked me to play with her, triangle or something. We had a rehearsal and it was completely horrible. Abysmal. So bad. We were like, ?Let&#8217;s never ever do this again.? A week later we tried again and we wrote ?Sunny In Splodges?, our first song, in two hours. We decided after that maybe we should keep going.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3015398/400x230-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>What made it all click?</strong><br/>
I have no idea. We were practicing in Alyx&#8217;s parents? studio [Audioloc Sound Design]. It&#8217;s really amazing. It&#8217;s in an industrial-ish area on the North Shore in Sydney, which is really suburban and stuck-up. This is near a university so we could play until 5am and it wouldn&#8217;t matter because there were no houses nearby. I think it just clicked that night. We&#8217;d been playing Alyx&#8217;s songs and it just wasn&#8217;t working. She said, ?Let&#8217;s try this?, and she played a little riff on the glock. [<em>Sings riff from ?Sunny In Splodges?</em>] We jammed on that and then wrote the song. I don&#8217;t remember what happened. It happened so quickly and it&#8217;s such a blur. That happens a lot when we write songs. We go into this weird trance.</p>
<p><strong>And you went on to win the band competition?</strong><br/>
We did, and we had such an amazing time &#8211; Band comps are such good incentive to write songs. We had one song, but a week before we were like, ?Holy shit, we need a 20-minute set and we have one song.? We had to write others, and between finals, we had other shows, and we were writing new material because we wanted something different for the next week. It&#8217;s a great way to start off, having these deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit of a Sydney thing, isn&#8217;t it? I know Cloud Control are past winners as well. In Melbourne you tend to get nu-metal acts at band comps.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a lot of funk in band competitions. [<em>Laughs*] Because we won the Sydney Uni comp we had to do the regional competition. It was so horrible. We actually came last &#8211; they read out last place to first place. The bands that were in the top three were all funk bands, and the band that won the entire competition were a 12-piece funk band. So there you go! [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><em>How long have you both been singing for?*</em><br/>
I&#8217;ve been singing since I was about seven in choirs. I&#8217;m not so sure about Alyx. We both got into musicals and performing in school concerts in high school. Before that I had never sung solo either, and it freaked the shit out of me when I first did it. I&#8217;m classically trained &#8211; I started playing piano when I was five &#8211; and Alyx is self-taught. I&#8217;ve been having singing lessons since I was 11 or 12.</p>
<p><strong>Are you the higher voice?</strong><br/>
I have a thinner voice. Alyx can sing equally high as me, if not higher &#8211; and lower. I don&#8217;t have as big a range as she does. I think maybe my voice sounds a bit elastic. No one&#8217;s asked me that before.</p>
<p><strong>Which voice is which?</strong><br/>
Yeah, we kind of change, so I don&#8217;t always sing higher things and she doesn&#8217;t always sing lower. We swap and change depending on the song.</p>
<p><strong>I ask because there&#8217;s a lot of overlap and it&#8217;s interesting to work out who&#8217;s singing what.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s interesting for us as well. [<em>Laughs*] It depends on the song. We&#8217;ve written a new song recently and I have to sing *really</em> high. It&#8217;s good, because I thought it&#8217;d be pushing my voice every time, but it&#8217;s actually made everything else more comfortable &#8211; Our voices have changed a lot since we started playing together as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a confidence thing?</strong><br/>
Knowing that you can sing a note really high live definitely needs confidence behind it &#8211; It&#8217;s also just about wanting to push ourselves. We&#8217;ve done high bits, but we can go higher &#8211; I think the most experimental part of our music is the vocals. We don&#8217;t do anything that crazily different musically. We end up using a lot of electronic equipment, because there&#8217;s only two of us, and we need samplers and samples to layer and make more textures. It&#8217;s weird to be called an electronic band. I suppose, we use electronic stuff to make organic sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer ?vocal duo??</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve had jazz before, and I wouldn&#8217;t go that far maybe. But, yeah, maybe vocal duo. That&#8217;s probably the best way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>Things seem to start with the vocal, and then the accompaniment sort of comes out of it. Is that the process?</strong><br/>
It depends. Often we&#8217;ll have a basic chord structure, and then we&#8217;ll put the vocals in. But the vocals are always a feature. They&#8217;re supposed to be the first thing you listen to? </p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re very prominent in the mix.</strong><br/>
Definitely. That&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve recently realised live. When we started playing, the vocals were way down. The mixes have been so good recently, because we&#8217;ve said, ?Look, everything needs to be loud, but the vocals need to be the loudest &#8211; they&#8217;re the most important part.? &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a recording of our first performance at the Sydney Uni band comp, and we&#8217;re really shy, especially the vocals.</p>
<p><strong>Do you use loops live?</strong><br/>
We have a couple of times. I really shy away from looping because, unless it&#8217;s done really well, it can fuck up very easily. If you&#8217;re basing a whole song on a loop, and something is out of time, then it&#8217;s going to be so far out of time for the whole song. I&#8217;m hesitant to do it, but there&#8217;s one song that we have to use one for. We only played it live in one setting. It was with Cloud Control and the crowd were so amazing for them, but it was a pub crowd and they spoke over us the whole time. We couldn&#8217;t even hear the loop. It was horrible, I&#8217;m a bit shattered by that experience. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Has it became an issue playing in front of pub crowds?</strong><br/>
It hasn&#8217;t been so bad recently. Definitely when we started out we played some shows that were just horrific. Totally wrong for us. As you get a bit more well known you have more freedom as to where you&#8217;re playing and who you&#8217;re playing with. We&#8217;re doing our album launch in a church [Paddington Uniting Church on October 22] in Sydney. That&#8217;s going to be amazing, it has amazing acoustics. The Cloud Control show was the most recent pub crowd, but apart from that, I can&#8217;t even remember the last one. We&#8217;ve been pretty lucky lately, especially in Melbourne, because everyone&#8217;s so nice. People come for support bands and that doesn&#8217;t happen in Sydney. People come for the headliner, and that&#8217;s exactly what happened at the Cloud Control show. Everyone just wanted to see Cloud Control, so it must&#8217;ve been really horrible for them. In Melbourne, we&#8217;ve had such great experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think it&#8217;s because you fit into that ?micro-scene? that&#8217;s happening in Melbourne? That tribal element of your music reminds me of Rat Vs Possum.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I really like Rat Vs Possum. Melbourne&#8217;s a good scene for us. We&#8217;ve felt very at home there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a connection to those bands?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re really close to the Parking Lot Experiments. Rat Vs Possum lent us their drums last time we were there, we know Love Connection. We&#8217;ve got a group of people that look after us down there.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that similar aesthetic things are happening in Melbourne, as well as Sydney. It&#8217;s almost like a collective consciousness.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really weird, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s interesting to see this growth of, I wouldn&#8217;t say experimentalism, but rather the methods people use to make sound. This is so off track, but I&#8217;m writing a music assessment on the <em>Doctor Who* <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=rH0hHZA0U5c&amp;feature=related">theme</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re a *Doctor Who</em> fan at all, but I am! It&#8217;s such an amazing piece of music. It was the start of synthesisers, basically, and they cut out like every second of analog [sound]. It&#8217;s incredible. It was a new way of making music, and it seems like people are finding new ways to make music now, which is really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Do your influences go beyond music?</strong><br/>
Alyx is a really good artist. I can&#8217;t draw for the life of me, but I love film scores, and I hope to go into that when I&#8217;m tired of touring. Film music is one of my favourite things to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>Was Bj&#8217;rk a really big vocal influence?</strong><br/>
[<em>Gasps</em>] We both love her so much. She&#8217;s amazing. When we started out, we got a lot of, ?Oh, they&#8217;re obviously inspired by Fever Ray?, and at the time we were like, ?Who&#8217;s Fever Ray?? We now love her a lot. Also, Joanna Newsom is one of our favourite composers. She&#8217;s brilliant. Every time I listen to her I&#8217;m so inspired to write lyrics. There&#8217;s Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear, but also a lot of classical influences. That&#8217;s maybe where it differs [from other bands]. I listen to a lot of modern classical composers like Karl Jenkins. His vocal stuff is awesome, some of it is really similar to what we do.</p>

<p><strong>Did your love of filmic music inspire you to go into Audioloc?</strong><br/>
Um, it was really handy having it there. We had a space to rehearse that we could go late into the night, and there was already a PA there ready to go. There was another band that rehearsed in the space that we were using. We borrowed some of their things sometimes. That&#8217;s why we happened to use a drum. We never, ever would&#8217;ve done that. There just happened to be a drum laying around, and a glock as well. That&#8217;s a really important component of our music.</p>
<p>In terms of film, [Audioloc] is more about post production &#8211; foley work, not composition. Alyx has had a lot to do with that &#8211; she&#8217;s done a lot of work with her parents. Foley is like the footsteps that you do post production. There&#8217;s this room in Audioloc that has all these different surfaces. It&#8217;s got sand, wood, concrete, and all these things you can walk on, depending on what&#8217;s in the movie. But, yeah, it was just awesome having that space, and the equipment there, and we also recorded there partly as well. It was very handy.</p>
<p><strong>I read in the press release that ?Trains? was the outcome of you frantically running around in the studio.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] We recorded the album in six days. When you&#8217;re in the studio for 12 hours, you start to go a bit insane. There&#8217;s a middle bit and very faintly in the background, you can hear screaming and weird shit going on. That&#8217;s the result of being cooped up inside for lots and lots of hours.</p>
<p><strong>The clarity of the recording really sticks out as well.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really produced, but it&#8217;s good to hear there&#8217;s clarity as well. That&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p><strong>Was that a focus before you went it?</strong><br/>
Definitely. Live, it&#8217;s something we strive for, and often fail at, because it&#8217;s really hard to get everything going, especially playing glocks. It&#8217;s so hard to mic them. Most importantly, again, is the vocals, and if they&#8217;re clear, we&#8217;re OK.</p>
<p><strong>What was [engineer] Daniell Johnston&#8217;s role in the recording process?</strong><br/>
He was like the third member of our band when we record with him. He arranged and played all the strings. He&#8217;s an incredible cellist. He&#8217;s a composer and musician in his own right. He went to the Con [Sydney Conservatorium of Music] here. The last song, particularly, called ?Stop (Reprise)? &#8211; was pretty much his baby. We said, ?This is what it should feel like?, and he went away and came back with it. That was his masterwork. He played a big part in lots of the songs. There are little transitions and he&#8217;s responsible for those. He just has a really good understanding of what we want.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It happened so quickly and it&#8217;s such a blur. That happens a lot when we write songs. We go into this weird trance.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you think a lot about sequencing? The album runs together quite seamlessly.</strong><br/>
The things is, I don&#8217;t even see it as 10 different songs. It&#8217;s just one big song &#8230; It flows really well, and that&#8217;s what we wanted: for it to be one big piece. </p>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s almost like a song cycle in classical music terms?</strong><br/>
Yeah, almost like a symphony. Actually, I wouldn&#8217;t go that far. [<em>Laughs</em>] The last song [?Stop (Reprise)?] is a reprise of ?Trains?. No one seems to know that &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s not that clear? &#8211; but there&#8217;s a little reprise of trains in the middle, where the riff comes back in. Little motifs come back here and there, and that&#8217;s what we wanted it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Are the interludes supposed to indicate a shift in moods?</strong><br/>
Yeah, and it was also a chance for us to do something a bit more improvisational in the studio &#8211; It was about having freedom in the recording process and making a connection from one song to another. ?Trains?, which is really happy, is different to something like ?Sunny In Splodges? or ?Sistar?, which is so intense. Having things that connect two songs that sound so different makes it more like one piece.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the sample at the end of ?Sistar??</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s Alan Watts, a British philosopher &#8211; We got it off YouTube, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a bit crackly, but it&#8217;s basically him talking about being selfish and wanting to be a good person, because it makes you feel good about yourself at the end of the day. His voice is amazing and his accent is lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Did you go into the studio with a preconceived idea of how the album would sound?</strong><br/>
We definitely went in knowing what we wanted it to sound like. We finished the album last year, so we&#8217;ve been waiting to release it for quite a while. Every song we had a pretty clear-cut understanding of what it would sound like. The only thing shady was the transitions. That was one of the best things about Dan [Daniell Johnston] too. Whenever we explained something to him, he just got it straight away; the atmosphere of a song, the way it made you feel, he captured that so well. He&#8217;s a very easy man to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Post-production must&#8217;ve been really intense as well.</strong><br/>
It was, but it was really fun. You can&#8217;t do that stuff live. There are infinite opportunities and you don&#8217;t want to get too carried away, because you&#8217;ll never be able to do it live. At the same time, we still go insane will all these vocal layers.</p>
<p><strong>I guess a band like Animal Collective proves that you can do one thing in the studio and then a completely different thing live.</strong><br/>
Exactly. We&#8217;ve been embracing that recently. There are things that you can&#8217;t do live, and it&#8217;s OK to make something different, because it should be different &#8211; You want to give the audiences something different from the record.</p>
<p><strong>Is every ky? show different from the next?</strong><br/>
It definitely feels like it. It depends on the audience, that&#8217;s for sure. When there&#8217;s a good crowd, there&#8217;s nothing like it. When there&#8217;s energy coming from the audience you feed off that. You let go and you have fun &#8211; We were stoked at how well the Xiu Xiu and High Places tour went. They were a really good match for us. We&#8217;ve been very lucky lately &#8211; Every show&#8217;s different, but depending on how close together they are, they may meld in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s coming up?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got the launches in October, we&#8217;re hoping to do some more touring in November and are hoping to be in the States in February &#8211; We&#8217;ve got next year planned out vaguely, but after that I have no idea. There&#8217;s no 10-year plan. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
