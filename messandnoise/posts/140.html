                <h3>You Am I didn&#8217;t want to make the same album twice. &#8216;Dilettantes&#8217;, learns <strong>A.H. CAYLEY</strong>, is no &#8216;Convicts II&#8217;.

<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3001585/325x489-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="325" height="489"/><br/>
It&#8217;s different, that&#8217;s for sure. A rather succinct and simplistic explanation of the work, certainly, but one that has been voiced by reviewers and fans alike in the month since <em><a href="/releases/2000128">Dilettantes</a>* was released. While *<a href="/releases/5488">Convicts</a>* was a fist-punching, angry assault of a record, *Dilettantes* is more considered; still the work of a hard rock band, but with softer, reflective moments of fragility and beauty in among the decidedly glam-rock stomps and soulful twists. It is an album as a whole &#8211; a complete work &#8211; one that seems void of too many discernable singles, to the benefit of the entire piece. *Dilettantes</em> is suggestive of a band comfortable in themselves and what they have already done, still experimenting with what they can do. </p>
<p>?<em>Convicts* is all about gusto and energy and all those sorts of things,? explains Andy Kent, bass player and manager. ?*Dilettantes* isn&#8217;t. I suppose there *was* a conscious decision to approach it differently in general, but then, of course, we just didn&#8217;t want to make *Convicts</em> again.? </p>
<p>?The last couple of records are quite heart-on-the-sleeve,? agrees Russell ?Rusty? Hopkinson, You Am I&#8217;s beat-maker. ?They&#8217;re very different to this record, which I think is a really evocative album. Tim [Rogers] has written some really beautiful songs, and we&#8217;ve been given the chance to embellish them as we&#8217;d like. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve always done, but on this record we&#8217;ve really pushed ourselves to not be the You Am I that people have down in their folders as a certain archetype.?</p>
<p><em>Dilettantes* is not archetypal. It is the progression of a band that has been too often dismissed as having already reached its highest point (*Hourly, Daily*, anyone?), and is proof that You Am I is still evolving. While in the past, Rogers? songwriting has been discernibly dichotomous &#8211; *this* sounds like a solo song; *that* sounds like a You Am I song &#8211; *Dilettantes* is where it all seems to meet at its best. Elements of Rogers? last solo album, the glorious *Luxury of Hysteria</em>, are particularly evident here, such as the oscillating delays preceding and following the opening track ?Dilettantes? and the string arrangements by cellist Mel Robinson, which give these songs such depth and detail that there seems to be something new to listen out for every time.</p>
<p>On the title track &#8211; a beautiful tribute to Jackie Orszaczky, string arranger on <em>Hourly Daily*, who died earlier this year &#8211; Rogers sings of regret and loss with touching poignancy: ?If I could never see you in the light/ What chance have I got finding you in shadows?? After the first live performance of this song at a solo gig earlier in the year at Sydney&#8217;s Annandale Hotel, Rogers explained that Orszaczky had once approached him demanding payment for his work on *Hourly, Daily</em>. Having assumed he&#8217;d already been paid, Rogers was surprised to hear otherwise, but then admitted he probably didn&#8217;t do enough to follow up on it. He never found out if Orszaczky received his payment, something that has plagued him since.</p>
<p>It is this sincerity that underpins some of the album&#8217;s best songs. ?Jolly&#8217;s First Time Around the Sun? is the earnest explanation of a father to his daughter that he&#8217;s new to this job and to forgive him his occasional mistakes, while ?The Piano Up the Tree? is the melancholy optimism of a man trying to ?back it on up and start again?, witnessing ?junkie dads with their feet on swings? and ?methed-up mums smoking down to stubs? from a third-storey window &#8211; and vowing to never return to that himself. It&#8217;s a truly beautiful song, and perfect as the final track on the album; fading to silence, it floors me every time.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Everyone lives in different cities, so in terms of scheduling, there were a lot of fucking cab receipts.?</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t, however, just a soft, emotional album. ?Wankers? sees You Am I experimenting with a glam sound; stomping drums and bass, call-and-answer guitars, cheeky Oscar Wilde quotes and a roaring chorus. ?The Big Wheel? is centred around a dirty, thundering bass line, a fuzzy guitar sound and a steady, persistent beat beneath the musical stop/starts. Rogers? husky recollections of a Hamburg nightclub are the only constant accompaniment. ?Davey&#8217;s Gone Green Again? hilariously details guitarist Davey Lane&#8217;s on-tour antics, while first single ?Erasmus? will be the live hand-clapper and hip-shaker. </p>
<p>Despite the decision to push themselves and their sound ?outside of [their] comfort zone?, by Hopkinson&#8217;s account, Kent maintains that it was still a very easy recording process, and that nothing on the record was forced. ?These things evolve and the parts start laying themselves. As long as it&#8217;s a collective kind of consciousness in the same space then, you know &#8211; off you go.?</p>
<p>?Making records with this band has never been a laborious process,? agrees Hopkinson. ?We&#8217;re not the kind of guys to pick at the same chords for two hours to try and ascertain as to whether that suits the mood &#8211; If it&#8217;s got the right spirit, then it&#8217;s got the right spirit.? </p>
<p>?It was pretty hard with everyone&#8217;s schedules, though,? explains Kent with a sigh. ?Everyone lives in different cities, so in terms of scheduling, there were a lot of fucking cab receipts, let me tell you. Thousands of dollars in cabs. But it&#8217;s pretty exciting, I&#8217;ve got to say, to go into the studio and have something not really do whatever you&#8217;d worked out, because then the possibilities among all that gear and the four &#8211; five &#8211; brains [including ?empathetic? producer Greg Wales] that are working on it &#8211; you just don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to sound at the end of the <em>day</em> even.</p>
<p>?When we were younger we always thought that was quite a decadent thing to do; to walk into a studio without your shit together, especially knowing what they cost, so we&#8217;d sort everything out. This one was different; it was better.? </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3001586/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="427"/>
<p>While the ?wholeness? of <em>Dilettantes</em> as an album seems to be a joy for fans, it has caused problems from a marketing perspective. ?It&#8217;s good that there&#8217;s not one good song and 10 shitty songs, but I wish there was a hit single,? says Kent. ?It&#8217;s just been a nightmare trying to pick what the next single is, and &#8211; I tell you &#8211; every single person in the band, and the record label people who we involve, everyone&#8217;s got a different opinion one week, and then they all change their opinion the next.? But surely, after 20 odd years, a hit single isn&#8217;t as important anymore? ?No, no it&#8217;s not, but at the same time, you still need to give radio stations something, and you need to make a video which means that song will be on TV. It&#8217;s easier to say, ?Yeah, here&#8217;s a song off our record?, rather than expecting them to trawl through and pick their own.? </p>
<p>Another issue is how the album will translate live. With string arrangements and various keyboard sounds, what form will <em>Dilettantes</em> take onstage? ?Mel&#8217;s going to come on some dates to play with us, but she can&#8217;t make all the dates,? Kent reveals. ?We&#8217;re excited about it, because she&#8217;s got quite an incredible musical ear and what she can contribute is great, so we&#8217;re really glad she&#8217;s going to come for some shows.</p>
<p>?Of course, I think it&#8217;s nuts to walk up there and replicate it <em>exactly</em>. And let me just tell everyone out there,? he whispers conspiratorially, ?that a lot of ?bands? just use a computer. But that&#8217;s not really our style. We&#8217;re going to take what we&#8217;ve recorded and we&#8217;re going to play it in a way that&#8217;s similar but different, and hopefully, in that environment, better.? </p>
<p>Not going to let you get away with that one, Andy. There was a laptop onstage at the album launch. ?Yeah, this is very true &#8211; Man, it&#8217;s got to be hidden! It doesn&#8217;t look good. What that is, is David&#8217;s got so many keyboard sounds that he&#8217;s got to play &#8211; one song&#8217;s got a Wurlitzer sound, the next a Hammond organ &#8211; we can&#8217;t possibly get every one of those great keyboards and pianos and whatever and set them all up, because that&#8217;s all that would be onstage. He runs the Fender Rhodes electric piano underneath it and then on top he has the laptop that gives him all those sounds. He&#8217;s playing it, it&#8217;s just saying, ?What do you want to play now, David?? and he&#8217;s saying ?I&#8217;ll play an upright piano &#8211; Now, I might play a Hammond.? It&#8217;s just ease of travel and all that.? </p>
<p>The ease of travel will be a necessary consideration. After the 16-date ?Let&#8217;s Be Dreadful? tour and the Australian festival season, You Am I will be heading out early in the new year for a two-month tour of Europe and the US. While hinting coyly at, but giving no details about, some sort of theatre production involving Mr Rogers in January, Kent admits that April is as far as the schedule extends. </p>
<p>?Maybe this will be our last record, maybe it won&#8217;t be. I don&#8217;t know!? Here&#8217;s hoping it isn&#8217;t. If <em>Dilettantes</em> is any indication, You Am I is far from done yet.  </p>
<p>?This band isn&#8217;t so bad after all,? Hopkinson declares. ?Which is what we&#8217;ve been saying all along. We ain&#8217;t going anywhere. We might split up tomorrow, but we probably won&#8217;t.?</p>
