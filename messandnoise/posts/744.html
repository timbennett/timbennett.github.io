                <h3>Ahead of a New Year&#8217;s Eve show at Goodgod Small Club in Sydney, Royal Headache bassist Joe Sukit reflects on a surreal year that&#8217;s seen them top the <a href="/articles/4393992">M+N Readers Poll</a>, among other accolades &#8211; not that they actually care.

<p/>
<p>?We&#8217;re taking a break,? declares Royal Headache&#8217;s Joe Sukit following a year that&#8217;s seen the release of their <a href="/releases/2000931">debut album</a>, a US tour, an <em>Age* EG Award for Best New Talent and Album of the Year in *M+N</em>?s annual <a href="/articles/4393992">Readers Poll</a> (they polled second in the same category when our critics <a href="/articles/4397589">weighed in</a>). ?The next three months will determine how much we&#8217;ll play,? he continues. ?We want to get back and start writing music again. Hopefully next year we can have another record out of some sort. From there, we&#8217;ll see what happens with shows.?</p>
<p>The band &#8211; Sukit on bass, Shortty on drums, Law on guitar and Shogun on primal wail &#8211; have had a breakout year by most standards, but it&#8217;s of little importance to a group of friends who just enjoy the camaraderie of playing together regardless of who&#8217;s tuning in. And they&#8217;re not alone. Royal Headache are enmeshed in a circle of like-minded friends who just happen to play in bands &#8211; from The UV Race and Woollen Kits in Melbourne to Straight Arrows, Bed Wettin? Bad Boys (of which Sukit is a member of) and Dead Farmers in Sydney. It&#8217;s no surprises then that a mid-morning phone call finds Sukit working on poster art for Woollen Kits? upcoming US tour. He says they&#8217;d be friends even if their mutual interest was &#8211; of all things &#8211; chess.</p>
<p>?They&#8217;re the best people to hang out with &#8211; we get along with them and we have the most in common with,? he explains. ?When you see someone that you can identify with, and they&#8217;re doing something that you&#8217;re really inspired by, then you automatically want to try and help and make it happen because you&#8217;ve gone through the same thing.?</p>
<p><strong>Has this year surpassed your expectations?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah, I guess so. We didn&#8217;t really think anything would happen with the record. Every single moment we&#8217;ve had since the start has been ridiculous in terms of people&#8217;s reactions. We don&#8217;t do anything, or go out of the way to promote ourselves, but for some reason people like it and get behind it. Everything&#8217;s been crazy. When the record came out we didn&#8217;t even get a chance to do anything here. When it came out we played a launch in Sydney and the next day we flew to America. While everything was happening here, we had no idea what was going on because we spent a month in America. It was weird to come back and have people be into it.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds like you&#8217;ve adopted the Eddy Current approach.</strong><br/>
Um, I guess so. It&#8217;s Eddy Current, but it&#8217;s just punk as well. The band has never been a full-time idea &#8211; We have fun, we get together and we just play music. That&#8217;s the whole reason behind the band. As soon as you get together and say, ?We&#8217;ve got to play this show, or do this and that?, you&#8217;re letting the whole point that you&#8217;re in the band fade away. You just lose that focus. We always do things on our own terms. If we don&#8217;t feel comfortable doing something than we don&#8217;t do it. There are probably a bunch of people that want us to continue playing shows for the next six months, but there&#8217;s no reason to. We just feel like it was better to take a break and get back to doing what we love the most.</p>
<p><strong>Can you ever see it becoming a full-time thing?</strong><br/>
No. [<em>Laughs</em>] We all work full-time jobs. To make music a full-time thing defeats the purpose of playing music. The reason why I look forward to jamming it getting rid of those frustrations of working full-time, or being surrounded by people you don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s a release every week to thrash out some songs. If all you have to do is worry about writing a song, it makes it really contrived &#8211; Plus, the music industry is so fickle anyway. We could turn around next week and nobody knows who we are. It&#8217;s always been a fun thing we do with our friends &#8211; and that&#8217;s about it, really.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still self-managed?</strong><br/>
Everything that we do, the US tour etc., we do ourselves. Maybe it&#8217;s not hard because people come to us, we don&#8217;t try and seek it out &#8211; I mean, we&#8217;ve never tried to seek it out. Even back at the start we got offered to play with The Buzzcocks. We didn&#8217;t seek out those shows. They just happened.</p>
<p><strong>I take it you&#8217;ve fielded some ridiculous offers of late.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] I guess so. There was a period when we got back from America when we were getting offered like five shows a week. Festival season, I guess everyone needs a support band. In Sydney, it&#8217;s like, ?Who is a small band that we can get to play, that might bring people, that would look cool on the line-up, and that we wouldn&#8217;t have to pay any money? Royal Headache!? [*Laughs</em>] We seem to get a lot of those offers. We played a couple of those shows in the past &#8211; we did it with The Buzzcocks and King Khan. We were big fans of The Buzzcocks, so there was no question that we&#8217;d do the show, but from the outside it&#8217;s like, ?Oh, cool. You get to play with The Buzzcocks and you get to hang out.? Inside, it&#8217;s a very different world. Those big industry shows, it&#8217;s big business and there are tour managers, and you&#8217;re not allowed to do this or that &#8211; Managing ourselves we can say, ?OK, well, we don&#8217;t want to play this show. We want to play at this place, with these people.? It&#8217;s good to be at that stage now.</p>
<p><strong>What made you say yes to the Goodgod [New Year&#8217;s Eve] gig then?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re friends with those guys &#8211; We did our launch at Goodgod before we went to America, and a show with The UV Race as well. It&#8217;s a cool place. It&#8217;s been there [Chinatown] for a while now and those guys are super keen to get stuff happening. It&#8217;s good for Sydney because, really, it&#8217;s hard to get a place that&#8217;s a proper venue that&#8217;s small enough to take you on. You can play Oxford Arts Factory or The Annandale, but you&#8217;ve got to pull 300 people, or you&#8217;re losing out on the night. What band can pull 300 people in the first six months? Before you get to that stage, where do you play? Goodgod has filled that gap.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>I guess that&#8217;s why the warehouse scene exists.</strong><br/>
Well, even that&#8217;s died off compared to what it was three or fours years ago. Red Rattler is a good place now because that&#8217;s actually licensed &#8211; it&#8217;s a legal warehouse. Before with Maggotville and Dirty Shirlows, they all got shutdown by the cops. That was a good thing for a couple of years, but even that stopped. It&#8217;s a weird situation. I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d do it as a new band at the moment [in Sydney]. We were lucky that we came up through the system, and somehow got enough people to like us so we&#8217;d be able to fill up a pub &#8211; Now we&#8217;re at a stage where we can get friends? bands on bills.</p>
<p><strong>It does feel though that Sydney&#8217;s garage scene is in a really good place.</strong><br/>
Well, garage is a weird term. I wouldn&#8217;t really classify anyone in Sydney as a garage band. It&#8217;s all coming from the same idea, the same place, but it&#8217;s all just punk rock. I don&#8217;t know. No one sounds the same and there&#8217;s no unifying aspect to the music?</p>
<p><strong>I guess Mikey [Young] and Owen [Penglis] producing everything leads some people to believe that.</strong><br/>
Oh yeah, but really Mikey&#8217;s approach is the least intrusive. People always seem to say it&#8217;s got that Mikey Young guitar sound. But none of the records, for me, have that guitar sound &#8211; It&#8217;s an easy thing for people to latch onto it, you know. It&#8217;s like, ?Mikey Young. Garage. We can label that, and pocket it all together and people will automatically pay attention.? It&#8217;s a lazy journalism thing for me. And, really, Owen didn&#8217;t produce anything on the record except for the vocals. He recorded some of Shogun&#8217;s vocal tracks when we came back to Sydney.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s a big misconception.</strong><br/>
Yeah, and it&#8217;s hard to say that. What are we going to do? Put a full-page sheet in the liner notes saying, ?Owen recorded this on this day, and did this.? We wanted to give him credit for the work he put in. At the end of the day, it wasn&#8217;t recorded by Owen in the sense that he was the man twiddling the knobs and saying, ?We&#8217;re going to make it sound like this.? And Mikey wasn&#8217;t either. We went in and basically set up all of our gear. He came in and put the microphones in front of the amps and we just played. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s appealing about doing it with Mikey: he was a friend sitting in a room trying to capture what we were doing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think he nailed it?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it sounds like us playing in a room, which is what we wanted. There&#8217;s not too much bullshit. People are calling it lo-fi, but that was never our intention. That whole thing seems really weird. It&#8217;s just another easy term for people to latch onto and lump together: ?The Australian Lo-Fi Scene.? Is <em>Damaged</em> by Black Flag a lo-fi record? It&#8217;s just a punk album recorded in the means they had. It just sounds like a band playing. Everything&#8217;s gotta be historicised automatically and be given a rigid structure of what the music is. There are all these stupid sub-genres that nobody even knows what they mean. It&#8217;s pushed by the internet, I guess, but it seems pointless at the end of the day. We just made a punk record which was just like us playing in a room.</p>

<p><strong>Were you happy to hear about topping the <a href="/articles/4393992">Readers Poll</a>?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] Yeah, it was pretty strange. It&#8217;s a little confusing to me because I guess you never really know how many people like what you&#8217;re doing. Every time someone says, ?I like your band?, I&#8217;m like, ?*Really*?? We never invest too much time or thought in anything really, so for someone to say, ?We think this is the best thing of 2011?, it&#8217;s weird. [*Laughs</em>] Most of the time we spend 10 minutes writing these songs. That&#8217;s not to say we didn&#8217;t put a whole lot of work, or invest everything we could into those 10 minutes, but it&#8217;s strange to have something that you do be liked.</p>
<p><strong>Music seems so complicated now &#8211; there&#8217;s so many different ways to put out records, and so many different ways to make records &#8211; maybe everyone needed a record like that to cut through?</strong><br/>
I can understand that as well. I look at the internet most of the time and I&#8217;m like, ?Where the fuck would you start to even like a band?? I don&#8217;t know how people listen to music anymore &#8211; it&#8217;s really bizarre. There&#8217;s so much bullshit involved now that&#8217;s completely unnecessary. We just try and do as little as possible and let the music speak for itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do people feel about the band in the States?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s hard to say. People were really surprised and liked us. I don&#8217;t think anybody really knew us before we went over. Essentially, Goner <a href="/news/4088110">Records] asked us to come and play [Gonerfest</a>, so we decided to turn it into a holiday and see America. Basically the shows just paid for our next van ride to the next city where we could go hang out and do whatever. It was the most profitable way to tour around. We only plaid for our flights over &#8211; The shows we played there were generally to about 15 people. Maybe we played to 40 people if we were lucky. Most of the people that came along were pretty surprised and actually liked it. Gonerfest was completely different because everyone that comes there actually knows what they&#8217;re in for. We played to a bunch of people. </p>
<blockquote><p>?We just made a punk record which was just like us playing in a room.?</p></blockquote>
<p>It was really interesting to see the reaction the Australian bands got there, like Kitchen&#8217;s Floor, Deaf Wish or Straight Arrows. Everyone was blown away with Australian music because it&#8217;s so lacking and devoid of bullshit. Whereas over there &#8211; everything is fucking dress-ups. Nobody is playing in a band as themselves. Everything&#8217;s a gimmick. To me that&#8217;s not interesting. It&#8217;s not authentic and makes the music really boring. That&#8217;s not everybody, though. There were a couple good bands that we were really into, but most of the time it was like, ?Are you serious? This again??</p>
<p><strong>I think the perception here is that a <a href="/news/3709940"><em>Pitchfork</em> endorsement</a> opens all these doors.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] The word endorsement I don&#8217;t really understand. We were just put on a website for a day with 40 other bands. We were really just a fart in the entire scheme of everything. We didn&#8217;t even get an album review. Didn&#8217;t The Twerps get a review?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15951-twerps-twerps/">they did</a>, but then they missed out on a whole lot of other bands that I thought would get reviewed: Geoff O&#8217;Connor, Total Control, Dick Diver.</strong><br/>
For me, <em>Pitchfork</em> is just really confusing and foreign. I don&#8217;t understand it. I never read it anyway. It&#8217;s weird to me that people think it&#8217;s still a thing &#8211; If you&#8217;re going to take that word as gospel, you&#8217;re probably not going to like our band anyway. I don&#8217;t know why people think it&#8217;s a big thing.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps it&#8217;s an Australian thing: we need validation from overseas.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s completely true. It&#8217;s stupid because if anybody went over to America and watched a whole bunch of bands every night, 90 percent of the time you can go down the street in Australia and see a better band playing. The records put out in Australia this year are miles ahead of all the crap in America. This inferiority complex is pretty stupid. People just need to have confidence in what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
