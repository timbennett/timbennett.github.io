                <h3>The Growl may not be named for Cameron Avery&#8217;s raspy baritone, but it&#8217;s as much a defining quality as the blown-out blues on the Perth band&#8217;s debut LP. Avery, who also drums for Pond, tells <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> about his ?heavy? church upbringing, his love of Elvis and touring America with Tame Impala.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3034845/425x425-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It&#8217;s not been a straight road to The Growl&#8217;s first album, <em>What Would Christ Do??</em>. The Perth band began as the solo project of Cameron Avery, then of Red Shoes Boy and Abbe May&#8217;s band. Soon he had teamed up with guitarist and eager self-recorder Clinton Oliver with happily gritty results. From there the band evolved into a proper six-piece and released a 2011 <a href="/releases/2000894">EP</a>.</p>
<p>Avery and Oliver and company have been chipping away at a full-length record since then, though they&#8217;ve had to juggle it with Avery&#8217;s duties drumming in Tame Impala sister band Pond. But now it&#8217;s done and out &#8211; in all its rusty glory &#8211; and the band got to celebrate by touring the States with Tame Impala themselves before returning to Australia for their own national headlining tour here.</p>
<p>Interviewed during the US adventure in early March, Avery opened up about the massive influence of the blues &#8211; and growing up the son of two church leaders &#8211; on The Growl. And also, about getting the band&#8217;s ?screechy, screechy guitars? and ?visceral kind of sounds? just right.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s the tour been with Tame Impala?</strong><br/>
Yeah, great. We&#8217;ve been playing massive venues and they&#8217;re all sold out. The reception has been overwhelming: nice crowds, nice people. It&#8217;s been crazy. They sung along to one of our songs the other night. A tour doesn&#8217;t get much better. The Tame guys are my best friends anyway, so touring around with your best buddies at sold-out venues, it&#8217;s been great. The best tour I&#8217;ve done, ever in my life.</p>
<p><strong>So you just know those guys from Perth and playing shows together?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I just started hanging out with Kev <a href="/articles/4440214">Parker] and Nick [Allbrook] and Jay [Watson] three or four years ago. Then I lived with Kev and Nick for three years. And I play drums with [Pond</a>, so they&#8217;re all my buddies. And Clint, who plays guitar in The Growl, recorded the new [forthcoming] Pond album. So everyone&#8217;s really buddies on tour. It&#8217;s great fun.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>The Growl started as you and Clint&#8217;s thing, right?</strong><br/>
It started originally as my thing that I wanted to do. I had songs that I wanted to record and Clint had this Roland eight-track digital [recorder]. I was playing in another band [and] I didn&#8217;t feel like the songs would translate in that band. Clint wanted to start recording bands and I wanted to start my own solo thing. The Growl was originally just a moniker for my solo project. Then it grew out from there to me and Clint recording stuff in his mum&#8217;s laundry on an eight-track.</p>
<p><strong>What was the other band you were in at that time?</strong><br/>
It was a band called <a href="http://whothehell.net/archives/7037">Red Shoes Boy</a>. And I played drums for <a href="/articles/3687896">Abbe May</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Does the name The Growl have anything to do with your style of singing?</strong><br/>
No, not at all. It was just something I came up with it. Wrote it on the side of my friend&#8217;s fridge in texter. I like the letters. I just like the sound of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It was something I grew up with. My mum listened to a lot of soul and blues. As I got older, I got more into delta stuff.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>From the lyrics to the music, there&#8217;s a real old and gritty blues thing throughout the band. What&#8217;s your history with that genre?</strong><br/>
Well, when I was a little kid, I was growing up with my mum and she was big into Aretha [Franklin] and Elvis Presley. When I was a kid, I adored Elvis. He&#8217;s probably my favourite of all time. I had this tape of box set [of his] that my grandma gave me. Then as I got older, it sounds ridiculous but my mum said at my 21st birthday that I used to play back the section in <em>Back to the Future</em> with ?Johnny B. Goode? in it over and over.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S1i5coU-0_Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, it was something that I grew up with a lot. My mum listened to a lot of soul and blues, and like Sarah Vaughn and Louie Armstrong. And then as I got older, I got more into delta stuff and listened to a lot of Skip James and Son House. For two or three years all I ever played was bottleneck and Southern blues music. In my later teen years I got really into heavy blues music.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It was a heavy, heavy church; my mum was a church leader, my dad [too]. We used to go to church two, three times a week.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John<em>the</em>Revelator_(song">?John the Revelator?</a>), which a lot of people have done, on the album. What made you want to put your mark on it?</strong><br/>
I heard it on a mixtape that got given to me. I think it was out of a <em>MOJO</em> mag or something. Then I listened to a lot of chain-gang music as well, when I dug into deeper delta/soul stuff, like gospel music. I love the idea of just a cappella singing and clapping. That song just resonated with me. My dad&#8217;s a pastor, like a preacher, and I&#8217;m not in any way religious, but I just sort of understood what the song is talking about. Even though I don&#8217;t read the Bible [any more], I knew what the metaphors in the song were about and what the Biblical reference was.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61865587?portrait=0&amp;color=bab8b8" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>I didn&#8217;t know about your dad, but I was going to ask about Biblical stuff. Partly from the album title and that choice of cover song, but also some press I read compared your live delivery to a preacher. It seems like a recurring theme.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I mean, I consider myself pretty agnostic. Hypocritical Christianity is something that&#8217;s always intrigued. I think there&#8217;s obviously some wrong there. It intrigued me a lot. I find it interesting, different people&#8217;s beliefs. Growing up in the church &#8211; it was a heavy, heavy church; my mum was a church leader, my dad was a church leader. We used to go to church two, three times a week. I haven&#8217;t seem him in years, but dad still is the leader of a large Australian Christian organisation, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the album title have two question marks?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know, I think it had more of a hilarity. I didn&#8217;t want it to be too serious, like an actual question. I used to always go on about hilarious Biblical references to my girlfriend, and I was talking about the album title because I didn&#8217;t know what the fuck to call it. And she said, ?Why don&#8217;t you call it <em><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php&#8217;term=Winner+Winner+Chicken+Dinner">Winner Winner Chicken Dinner</a></em>? And I was like, ?Oh, WWCD. Wait a second, that means ?What would Christ do??? So it came about that way.</p>
<p>The two question marks, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve got that question two or three times in the last week. It was funnier rather than a serious [<em>affects low and doomy voice</em>] ?What would Christ do??</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, it gives it an exaggerated, comic edge.</strong><br/>
What the fuck would have happened if I&#8217;d done three?</p>
<blockquote><p>?I realised I like visceral sounds. I started stacking cymbals up on top of each other so they&#8217;d get this loud clatter.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Have long have you been working on this album?</strong><br/>
Nearly two years. It&#8217;s just been bits and pieces here and there. It&#8217;s really annoyed me, though, because my vibe on things and what I learn about recording stuff changes, obviously, as you learn. Just as the <a href="/releases/2000894"><em>[Cleaver Leaver</a></em>] EP came out [in 2011], I started writing and recording all this new stuff. Just here and there, wherever I could finish it. I did some of it at the place where me, Nick and Kev lived, I did some of it at [drummer Mike Jelinek&#8217;s] house, I did some of it at Clint&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>And then when Pond started touring, I lost a lot of time working on it. Mike and Clint were always waiting for [my] final say, so I didn&#8217;t want to approve things from the road just through my headphones. And I didn&#8217;t really want to rush it either. I wanted it to be finished and good and done.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a really interesting-sounding record. It&#8217;s got that blown-out, rusty, clattering thing. Some of the percussion almost sounds like rubbish cans.</strong><br/>
Yeah, there is a bit of that on the recording. Weird old cymbals. Ever since I started recording, I liked to just see what it sounded like. That&#8217;s the best thing about Clint when we started: he didn&#8217;t really know much about it and I knew fuck all about it. Clint humoured a lot of my ideas.</p>
<p>On ?3, 6, 9? [from the EP], for instance, there&#8217;s three drum tracks: there&#8217;s a left-hand drum, a middle drum and a right-hand drum. Like hard-pan left, hard-pan right and one in the middle. As I developed into recording more stuff, I realised I like visceral kind of sounds. Like clatter-y, weird sounds. I started stacking cymbals up on top of each other so they&#8217;d get this loud clatter.</p>

<p/>
<p>There&#8217;s not many cymbals on the album; I tried to use the least number of cymbals possible. I hate hi-hats. I don&#8217;t <em>hate* them, but I don&#8217;t like using them and I don&#8217;t like chime-y ride cymbals. I found things got heavier when you took the cymbals away. It got a bit more of that gutty thing about it, rather than [*makes ?psh psh? sounds</em>].</p>
<p><strong>That high-frequency thing.</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. If your drums are taking up the lower frequency, or like the lower-mids, then you&#8217;ve got less room for screechy, screechy guitars. All that top end, you can hear it all the crazy [stuff]. You spend so much time moulding your guitar tone, but you can&#8217;t hear it if there&#8217;s fucking ride cymbal or something exploding overtop of it.</p>

<p><strong>I want to ask about the song that&#8217;s a massive acronym [?NIYWTLWOE?]. It sounds more electronic, almost like a remix. Is there a story behind that?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it used to sound a lot different. The riff in the beginning, that bass riff, was the thing I came up with it when I was just stuffing around playing one day. This evil-sounding, weird riff. And Mike started playing drums along to it. So we recorded a version live and I just didn&#8217;t like the live sound of it. I always wanted it to sound like this computer-y &#8211; not computer-y, but &#8211; it did end up sounding a lot like Skrillex. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<blockquote><p>?I just tried to not pigeonhole us as any kind of band, and just try to make it sound weird and fun. In my head that&#8217;s how I wanted it to sound the whole time.?</p></blockquote>
<p>But that&#8217;s the last one I mixed. I was stuffing around with Kevin one night back in Perth and I just started really, really thinking outside the box. As much as a lot of stuff is pretty roomy on that record, I love presence. One of my favourite records is <em>Embryonic* [by The Flaming Lips]. There&#8217;s this present thing that&#8217;s like right in your face. So I just wanted to get that on the album. I never wanted that song to sound organic. We even got it mastered and I was like, ?This sucks,? so I completely ripped the song to bits. Like you said, I remixed it. I remixed the whole thing and made it sound glitch-y and stop-y. The middle bit, Kevin was making jokes: ?Meanwhile, back in the iron yard?? That middle section is all [*makes industrial noises</em>].</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, I just followed my instinct and didn&#8217;t filter anything. I tried not to pigeonhole us as a garage-y band at all. I just tried to not pigeonhole us as any kind of band, and just try to make it sound weird and fun. In my head that&#8217;s how I wanted it to sound the whole time, which took me a while to realise.</p>
