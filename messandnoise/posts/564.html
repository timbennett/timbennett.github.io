<strong>Bloodclot Faggots</strong><br/>
<em>Hey Joe</em><br/>
(Cassette, No Patience, 2010)</p>
<p>Unholy hardcore from the City Of Churches that owes a lot to early-20s angst and hatred of security guards. The name confuses/alarms those not familiar with the homophobic tendencies of Bad Brains singer H.R., but confusing and alarming seems to be the modus operandi here. From what I can gather this dubbed tape only has one of their songs. The rest includes Jimi Hendrix doing a live version of &#8216;Hey Joe&#8217; and some random radio interview about the tax system and marketing. The Fags have since broken up &#8211; the 40 copies of this paint-splattered tape have sold out &#8211; but they have a 7? out, which is a lot better. It features the kind of busted-out rage that brings to mind Void, H-100s and an early model HiAce with a clapped-out carburetor. Music you can play while stuffing bodies in barrels.</p>
<p/>

<strong>Bloody Hammer</strong><br/>
<em>Pogo Rock</em><br/>
(Cassette, Hardcore Victim, 2010)</p>
<p>Yeap Heng Sheng is a one-man hardcore wrecking ball: tour booker, label operator and former/current member of Pisschrist, ABC Weapons, Kromosom and Bloody Hammer. His Oi-influenced cider bent channels Cocksparrer, buzzcuts and suspenders. On <em>Pogo Rock</em>, he&#8217;s changed up the vocals a bit from his work with Pisschrist. There seems less self flagellation ?80s hardcore worship and more rocky East End snarl. It sounds like one big messy party. I love this band. I love this tape. The guitar on &#8216;Smash Them All&#8217; even has a Wipers kinda vibe going on. Highly recommended. Oi!</p>
<p/>

<strong>Flesh World</strong><br/>
<em>Flesh World</em><br/>
(Cassette, independent, 2010)</p>
<p>Sick of playing at the scout hall in their hometown of Woodend, Victoria, Flesh World moved to Melbourne and have since become one of the best hardcore bands in the city. Their no bullshit, straight-up meanness makes everyone in the room uneasy, not least because frontman Liam is a lumbering hulk of a man with a psychopathic-like snarl and stare. The A-side &#8211; about the pained neurosis and claustrophobia that comes with living in a punk sharehouse &#8211; is almost a homage to the Void side of the classic Void/Faith split. Things fall apart into some Flipper-like squall on the B-side. Really good.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="" data-src="/images/3017582/235x235-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="235" height="235" style="margin-bottom:10px;"/><br/>
<strong>Trench Sisters</strong><br/>
<em>Demo</em><br/>
(CD-R, independant, 2010)</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Trench Sisters are a fast hardcore band from Melbourne. For those who don&#8217;t care they feature members of Extortion, Roskopp, Terror Firma, Halo Of Knives, Go For Broke and Internal Rot, among others. Hyper-fast rhythms and guitar of the power violence and fast core persuasion. Particularly inspired by Black Army Jacket and Hellnation ie. bands not afraid to mix some sludge with the fast. The brevity of the vocals adds maximum impact: ?Fucking kids dressed like pricks/Punching each other, sucking dicks/I can&#8217;t stand the youth of today,? screams vocalist Doug on &#8216;Dickhead&#8217;. Pretty much sums the whole thing up.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="" data-src="/images/3017583/213x314-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="213" height="314" style="margin-bottom:10px;"/><br/>
<strong>Kromosom</strong><br/>
<em>Kromosom</em><br/>
(Cassette, Hardcore Victim, 2010)</p>
<p>This tape could break your machine. It did mine, but not before I got to hear some mental Japanese-inspired hardcore thrash (with emphasis on ?thrash?). Rough-as-guts punk that slays in its intensity. It&#8217;s no coincidence the opening track is called &#8216;Systematic Death&#8217; &#8211; the Yokohama band of the same name is an obvious influence on Kromosom&#8217;s sound and approach. Fist-pumping, noise-drenched hardcore that takes all the good things of Japan/Scandinavia punk and adds its own charm. Boston Matt even sings in Swedish on the track ?Etsa?. This rules hard.</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Meat Thump</strong><br/>
<em>Neck Tattoo</em><br/>
(Cassette, Negative Guest List, 2010)</p>
<p>Lo-fi codeine burnouts from Brisbane&#8217;s biggest misanthrope Brendan Annesley, editor of <em>Negative Guest List</em> fanzine and erstwhile stirrer of shit. Enlisting the help of some friends from his NA group (including members from xNoBBQX and White Cop) he holed up in some motel and smashed out some early Pink Reason and Psychedelic Horseshit- like instrumental dirge. He sings/moans on one song. Look out for a split with the Boondall Boys.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="" data-src="/images/3017584/201x314-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="201" height="314" style="margin-bottom:10px;"/><br/>
<strong>Pissbolt</strong><br/>
<em>Live Kvlto Thrash</em><br/>
(Cassette, Altered States Tapes, 2010)</p>
<p>A live recording of the sorely missed thrashers at their second last show at the Workers Club in Melbourne back in April 2010. Recording quality is pretty woeful, but is still able to capture what made this band so great: guttural and base screaming, frantic drumming and a guitar sound that melds hardcore, noise and mental thrashing about. For a three-piece they had a big sound and their live shows were pretty manic. Probably not a good starting point for the band &#8211; <em>Death Register</em> is a better record &#8211; but for fans of these ragers (and I know there are a few) this is well worth it.</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Half Heads</strong><br/>
<em>Half Heads</em><br/>
(Cassette, Insert Coin Records, 2010)</p>
<p>Brisbane-via-Melbourne garage goofiness featuring members of the Fancy Boys and Chinese Burns. Poppy and peppy songs that nail the energy and humour of good garage rock and turf the poncy pretentiousness. This will no doubt be a hit over at the Terminal Boredom message board. The highlight is &#8216;Hanging Around&#8217;, a blown-to-shit song/drinking session, while &#8216;Totem Animal&#8217; has an almost early Stones swagger. Well, not really, but it definitely rocks like it.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="" data-src="/images/3017585/251x235-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="251" height="235" style="margin-bottom:10px;"/><br/>
<strong>Tough Troubles</strong><br/>
<em>Illnesses</em><br/>
Cassette, Geneva Lake Records, 2010</p>
<p>Easily one of the finds of 2010. This tape has got it all: dark wave synth, cheap drum machines, spewed-up riffs and post punk that harkens back to the day when it was done right by old curmudgeons from the UK. It&#8217;s no surprise to find that Tough Troubles are a couple of Aussies (and their friend) now residing there. And it&#8217;s a concept album. Each song detailing a condition, an illness, the onset of a disease, a hereditary syndrome or a chromosome mutation. For people interested in what Total Control are doing at the moment.</p>
<p/>
<p><img class="" data-src="/images/3017586/222x314-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="222" height="314" style="margin-bottom:10px;"/><br/>
<strong>Leprosy</strong><br/>
<em>Tour Cassette</em><br/>
(Cassette, Hardcore Victim, 2010)</p>
<p>With song titles such as &#8216;Death and Torture&#8217;, &#8216;War&#8217;s a Nightmare&#8217;, &#8216;Capital Punishment&#8217; and &#8216;No &#8216;More Warfare&#8217;, there&#8217;s no mincing words or ideals with Leprosy. This is raw anarcho punk &#8211; we&#8217;re talking glue in hair and patches on jackets. While this style of punk (influenced by UK82 and Scandinavian punk and predominantly Finnish hardcore) can sometimes feel like the same Discharge or Mot&#8217;rhead riff repeated ad nauseam, this tape (containing their side of a split with LA band The Helpless and their demo from 2009) mixes it up enough to warrant more than one listen.</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Acid Casualty</strong><br/>
<em>Acid Casualty</em><br/>
(7?, independent, 2010)</p>
<p>Even though they&#8217;re no longer a band, Acid Casualty were some brutal dudes. A gang with no leader. Chanted vocals with primitive drum bashing. These kids ruled the school/skatepark. Rambling slurred vocals that go from high pitched to monotonal drone and guitars that bang on like some art damaged burn out. &#8216;Trash Can&#8217; sounds nonsensical but it probably means something to someone.</p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Lakes</strong><br/>
<em>Live at Sunshine and Grease</em><br/>
(Cassette, independent, 2010)</p>
<p>A recording of Lakes (aka Sean Bailey) performing at the launch of his album, <em>Solar Flecks</em>, at Melbourne&#8217;s Sunshine and Grease record and book store in March 2010. The first thing you notice is Bailey&#8217;s unique guitar playing. He hits really hard, like a drummer backed by wails, different registers and synths. To be honest I&#8217;ve always enjoyed Bailey&#8217;s other projects over Lakes, but the guitar really drags you in. His dark vocals take on a haunted and cultish folksong vibe, while the chants and drones have an almost raga-ish mystical feel about them. Like if Will Oldham was writing about the Ganges instead of the Mississippi.</p>

<strong>Brainwaves</strong><br/>
<em>Brainwaves</em><br/>
(7?, independent, 2010)</p>
<p>With its herky-jerky early DC punk sound, Brainwaves? demo was one of the best releases of 2009. They follow it up with a killer single of intense and confident punk. Though theirs is a more melodic rock sound then a lot of of the current ?hawdcaw? bands, Franca&#8217;s urgent vocals and interesting guitar parts make for a solid record. On &#8216;Can&#8217;t Take It&#8217; she spits out a fiery and pleading call/warning that she&#8217;s had enough. Brainwaves have grown from young punks nervously opening gigs to a confident and energetic unit, and this single proves that they have plenty of promise.</p>

<strong>Bile Worship</strong><br/>
<em>Animal House/Make It Up Club</em><br/>
(Cassette, Magik Crowbar, 2010)</p>
<p>A collaboration between Psychward, TSS and MV. Hiss, electronics, Channel 31 drone, Afghan police investigation equipment. Like all Psychward projects this can be a challenging listen and definitely not for everyone. But for those looking for music outside the barbed wire box this is going to float your boat &#8211; or bombard it with kamikaze noise.</p>

<p><strong>Late Arvo Sons</strong><br/>
<em>Pretty Mess</em><br/>
(7?, Up Yours Records, 2010)</p>
<p>Raw and honest, but melodic rock that has a real unpretentious Aussie vibe. These guys realise they&#8217;re not reinventing the wheel, but still maintain a sound that&#8217;s their own; one that draws influence from beyond inner-city enclaves. The kicker is no doubt &#8216;Get Used To It&#8217; with its lurching and jittery energy. While the band would probably hesitate at calling &#8216;No Pride&#8217; a ?political? song, as Australia Day looms, it has a sentiment that will surely resonate.</p>
