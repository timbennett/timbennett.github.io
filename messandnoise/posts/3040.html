                <p style="text-align: center;"><em>This interview ran in 2012.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bek Moore from Brisbane&#8217;s Clag talks to SHAUN PRESCOTT about the band&#8217;s infamous live shows, reacting to male rock stereotypes, why Henry Rollins is a &#8220;wanker&#8221; and the challenges of being provocative in 2012.</strong></p>
<p>Clag formed in early &#8217;90s Brisbane. The group centred around a core three-piece consisting Bek Moore on vocals, Rachael Cooke on guitar and Alison Bolger on bass, with other members popping in and out seemingly at random.</p>
<p>As vocalist Bek Moore relates below, Clag were a very weird band. Elements of their sound are relatively commonplace in 2012, but remember that this is a group who, at their height in the early-&#8217;90s, were able to rile pub punters with the drop of a costume hat. While many grunge groups traded in resigned misanthropy, Clag were writing songs about chips and gravy, and with a sound that ranged from clean synth-laced pop through to scrappy punk, punters who could forgive their silly costumes and provocative stage banter were still liable to be confused by their reckless genre swapping.</p>
<p>Roughly two decades later, Clag is reforming for two shows in support of their <em>Pasted Youth</em>&#160;retrospective, released in March on Chapter Music. From her home in Brisbane, Bek Moore explains how the reformation came about, why it&#8217;s not a terrible idea, and what a potential future for Clag could look like.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Bek. You&#8217;re based in Brisbane at the moment, is that correct?</strong><br/>
I am at the moment, but everyone else is in Melbourne. Because the band started in Brisbane, I&#8217;ve got band members from the early ?90s up here. So whenever Rachael [Cooke] comes up for a visit we have a Clag jam up here with whoever else was in the band.</p>
<p><strong>Have you guys been doing that for a while? How has coordinating rehearsals for the forthcoming shows worked out?</strong><br/>
This has been a long time coming, and we&#8217;ve been working on the CD for the last 18 months. We weren&#8217;t even sure if we were going to do a launch gig when I was first talking to Guy [Blackman, Chapter Music] about it. He offered to put the back catalogue stuff out and it was a side project we were both working on for a while. At the same time every time I&#8217;d go to Melbourne I&#8217;d spend time with Rachael and whenever she came up here we&#8217;d have a Clag jam, just to keep her fingers nimble cause she sort of stopped playing in bands for a while. But there&#8217;s been intensive practices in Melbourne and I grabbed Chris Moller [formerly of Midget, now in Blood Relative] who lives around the corner to come around and play guitar so I can practice.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3029384/350x357-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" alt=""/><br/>
<strong>What&#8217;s it like revisiting the material?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s weird. I remember years ago I was working at [Brisbane community radio station] 4ZZZ. It was the early &#8217;90s and the Buzzcocks came in for an interview. I was only 18 or 19 and they seemed like really old dudes to me, even though they were probably only in their 40s or something. I was sitting upstairs listening to the interview and going, &#8220;Fuck, when I&#8217;m 40 I hope I&#8217;m not still singing these sorts of songs&#8221;, cause they&#8217;ve got songs like &#8216;Orgasm Addict&#8217; and stuff, real juvenile shit, and it just seemed really creepy to me, these 40- to 50-year-old men singing about how they wanted to get off with high school girls. So some of the Clag stuff makes me cringe a little when I listen to the lyrics, they make me go, &#8220;Wow. What was I thinking when I wrote that?&#8221; Then there&#8217;s other stuff that I didn&#8217;t like at the time that I listen to now and go, &#8220;Wow, I really dig that.&#8221; So it&#8217;s been a mixed bag. It&#8217;s been really nice getting the live material and the 4ZZZ live-to-air, because they were the lost documents. Listening back has been nice, we were lucky enough to have a gig [recorded] where we had idiot friends heckling us.</p>
<p><strong>On the heckling, did that happen a lot at Clag shows?</strong><br/>
Invariably. It did happen a lot. It happened a lot because we had a few friends who were five or six years older than us and played in bands. We ourselves used to go to Custard gigs and heckle the shit out of them when we were underage, so it all seemed kinda karmic really. And then our friends used to come along and just give us shit, it was a bit of banter, a bit of fun. But we also tended to strike general confusion into at least half the audience, and if that general confusion belonged to someone with an IQ that was below average, it tended to evolve into anger. So there were occasions when the heckling was fairly vicious and involved people throwing things at us. There was a gig up the Sunshine Coast that we literally had to do a runner from, with a guy attached to the front of the car.</p>
<p>So people either loved it or hated it. We were trying to make a point and we were trying to piss people off in lots of ways. But at the same time we were all huge pop fans, and we liked to write nice pop songs. Getting a reaction was part of the deal. It went along with the costuming and putting crazy shit on stage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>What do you think it was about the band that pissed people off, beside the costumes and crazy shit?</strong><br/>
I think they just didn&#8217;t get it. We didn&#8217;t slip easily into any given genre, and we&#8217;d play with a wide variety of bands. Even if you look at the first EP launch, I mean you had us and the Melniks, which was a pretty natural match in Brisbane at the time, but then you had Midget, who were a total wall-of-noise band and the Hooray Henrys, which was far more musically complex and very different to Clag. People like things to be simple, and they like to be able to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s a grunge band&#8221;, or &#8220;That&#8217;s an indie pop band&#8221;, or &#8220;That&#8217;s a hardcore band&#8221;, or &#8220;That&#8217;s a girl band&#8221; and we always made sure we had one token boy so we could never be categorised as just a girl&#8217;s band. We went out of our way to have a set that was a jumble fuck of genres all thrown in together.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s easy with the benefit of hindsight to assume Clag were reacting to the prevailing male rock group archetype. Was that something the group were pushing against consciously?</strong><br/>
Semi-consciously. We certainly were in a way, especially because of the time and place: Brisbane in the &#8217;90s. That little monologue I do at the beginning of the 4ZZZ live-to-air [on the record], where I say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;re not a one-syllable band&#8221;, [that&#8217;s referring to] all these male cock rock grunge bands at the time that were really fucking average, but had huge followings. What they were doing was just so generic and ripped off and it&#8217;s not that it was bad, it was that it wasn&#8217;t good. &#8216;Chips and Gravy&#8217; was a direct poke at all those guys, you know, a ridiculous song we wrote after going to a complete wuss-pop show with the Clouds and Falling Joys, and then we wrote this &#8220;fuck you rock&#8217;n&#8217;rollers&#8221; song. It was a good gig, the Clouds and Falling Joys one.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>I hate to use the word &#8220;twee&#8221;?</strong><br/>
Me too.</p>
<p><strong>But there&#8217;s some of those elements in Clag&#8217;s sound. Twee was once quite a political and radical thing, a reaction against meatheads like Henry Rollins?</strong><br/>
Oh yeah, Henry Rollins. What a fuckhead that guy is. He came into 4ZZZ as well once, he was a wanker. Look, we really did embrace that back then, loved it, absolutely adored it. Back then twee was punk. Even though it was so soft, it was very reactionary and it was politicised. I&#8217;ve got twee roots and as much as I fight against them I can still sit down and listen to Kimya Dawson for god knows how long. I love Jonathan Richman. Even Ben Lee, if you listen to a whole Ben Lee album you almost want to throw up by the end of it, but there are certain songs of his that are incredibly great, catchy pop songs. But I think it [twee] has lost a little bit of its shine in that way, and that&#8217;s no fault of its own. Twee and simplicity seems to have been confused somewhere along the line. A beautiful, simple pop song, just basic instrumentation, basic vocals; it can be a really nice thing.</p>
<p><strong>There are so many indie bands influenced by it nowadays, to the extent where twee has maybe been conflated with soft, calm indie pop music.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s lost its edge. That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t individual artists or bands out there that have managed to maintain it. There&#8217;s stuff like Lily Allen that&#8217;s kinda commercial twee. Originally it was a purity and a soulfulness, a baring of the soul, and I think some of that has been lost over the years and it&#8217;s just become another genre.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see any groups nowadays reacting against a prevailing sound or attitude? Against, for instance, the guitar pop that gets flogged on Triple J?</strong><br/>
I never listen to triple j because I find it incredibly annoying. I do listen to 4ZZZ a fair bit. I really like Drunk Elk from Tasmania, but I&#8217;m not sure how reactionary I&#8217;d call it &#8211; but they kind of are because they&#8217;ve got that really drone-y, out-of-tune vocal thing happening. I love flat vocals. I like musicians who are brave enough to put stuff out that&#8217;s not perfect. I was listening to Gareth Liddiard&#8217;s solo album [<em>Strange Tourist</em>]&#160;last night and I thought &#8220;that was fucking amazing&#8221;, and hugely reactionary: just him and a guitar.</p>

<strong>Clag formed in late high school &#8211; were you mates long before the band formed? How many of you were musically trained?</strong><br/>
Rachael, Alison [Bolger] and I all went to the same high school but we didn&#8217;t really hang out. Rachel and Alison were friends from about grade 8 but I didn&#8217;t hang out with them until grade 12. Rachel is a classical guitarist and has played it since she was a kid, her dad was a classical guitarist as well and he wouldn&#8217;t talk to her for a week when she bought an amp. [<em>Laughs</em>] Alison had piano lessons for years, then played saxophone for years &#8211; so both of them are incredibly irritating fuckers who can pick up any instrument and the next day they&#8217;re playing. Rachel bought a mandolin at one point and within a few days she had it singing. They can both play piano accordion for god&#8217;s sake. Nicole [Thibault] from Minimum Chips was our trombonist in Brisbane, she did music at uni.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not musically trained at all, I was the one who &#8211; when we were mucking around &#8211; was told to sing because no one else would do it. It was basically Rachael and I hanging out and writing songs and then blackmailing people into joining the band. It&#8217;s a weird mix of people who are actually quite musically talented, and then me, who&#8217;s not allowed to play tamborine because I have no sense of rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>You guys were quite young when the band formed but it sounds like there was a bit of musical know-how circulating. So why did Clag sound so scrappy? Was it a stylistic decision?</strong><br/>
Yeah, lo-fi was key. At the time we were, or I was anyway, listening to lots of Flying Nun and lots of &#8217;80s Brisbane and Australian stuff &#8211; The Go-Betweens, The Triffids, The Church. Also Chris Knox and Tall Dwarfs. He&#8217;s possibly one of my favourite artists ever, and he&#8217;s the king of the four-track. We could do a tight show when we had to: when you&#8217;re playing the Livid festival you&#8217;re not going to get up and play and be sloppy as all fuck. But there was nothing wrong with mistakes, Clag never had a fight at the end of a show because someone dropped a note, or just completely stopped playing in the middle of a song. It would usually elicit laughs. Clag was about more than just presenting songs to an audience &#8211; it was a show.</p>

<p><strong>Given that you were singing up the front most of the time, were you ever worried that the shows would get out of hand? Was there ever danger present?</strong><br/>
I loved it, hey. I think I was too young and stupid to realise that at times I was perhaps provoking the wrong people. The angrier I could make people the better. There&#8217;s nothing better than making these post-adolescent males really angry by singing &#8220;look, look, look! In the goldfish bowl!&#8221; The dichotomy is so fantastic, it&#8217;s hilarious. People want to beat you up while you&#8217;re singing about getting a bike for Christmas from Santa and mum and dad. It was a beautiful thing. We were actually chased into the car park once.</p>

<strong>What happened there?</strong><br/>
We were doing a show at the Sunshine Coast, I don&#8217;t even know why, that was dangerous to start with. It wasn&#8217;t a huge crowd, there was probably only 40 or 50 people there and they were just kinda bogan coasties. They were used to pretty straightforward fodder I guess: a couple of guys get onstage with black jeans, a fuzz pedal and a Nirvana cover thrown in. If girls got on stage they&#8217;d be wearing something either pretty or sexy and singing lilting harmonies. And we weren&#8217;t. And then we&#8217;d bait the audience on top of it. I got really good at dodging. The more they&#8217;d throw things the more I&#8217;d invite them to. &#8220;Is that your best shot?&#8221; I loved the interaction and playing with the crowd. I was young and at times I misjudged, but not too many times and we normally had friends at shows as well, as backup.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think things have changed much? Would Clag elicit the same response in similar venues in 2012?</strong><br/>
No. I don&#8217;t think so, I think if we were 18 now and creating a band it&#8217;d sound very different to Clag. We&#8217;d present something similar but the sound would be worlds away. We were always looking to do what wasn&#8217;t happening on the main indie scene, and you know, even back then indie pop was stuff like The Wonder Stuff and Ned&#8217;s Atomic Dustbin &#8211; it was kinda power pop. I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;d sound like, but if we sounded like Clag there wouldn&#8217;t be much of a reaction or ripple at all. Since Clag, the number of times I&#8217;ve been listening to the radio and heard a song and thought, &#8220;Fuck! That&#8217;s a Clag song!?&#8221; I&#8217;m not saying these people even knew we existed, but the sound isn&#8217;t special now. Clag was about attitude as much as anything &#8211; we&#8217;d still have the attitude but it&#8217;d sound different.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think it would take to do something weird now, to elicit similar reactions in 2012?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s a good question. I had Rachel on the phone just before you called and I was like, &#8220;Culture me Rach, what are we doing at this show?&#8221; And she said we had to come up with something. I said that we should play in burqas and she said, &#8220;No, we can&#8217;t.&#8221; It&#8217;d be fun. I reckon that&#8217;d be awesome and I&#8217;d get the joke, but it&#8217;s just such a political hot potato. We never used to be scared of standing on any political hot potato, that was part of the game, but I dunno &#8211; some electric cigarettes could be good? I hate the fact you can&#8217;t smoke on stage anymore. And I was going to wear a Fitzroy jersey &#8211; they merged with Brisbane around the time Clag formed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a gig up the Sunshine Coast that we literally had to do a runner from, with a guy attached to the front of the car.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why did the band break up?</strong><br/>
We didn&#8217;t really break up, we just kind of stopped practicing. We got side projects going &#8211; I had Above Ground Pool, Alison was playing in either Sleepy Township or Minimum Chips, Nicole was in Minimum Chips &#8211; Rachael moved back to Brisbane for a year, and by the time she came back we were all involved in other stuff. Then I went to Perth &#8211; so we never formally broke up or had a falling out or anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a possibility of new material?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re definitely going to have one new song for the launch, and that&#8217;s task number one when I get to Melbourne. Then we&#8217;ll take it from there. We&#8217;re all really energised about this, the fact that Clag didn&#8217;t actually break up helps because there&#8217;s no bad feelings between anyone, and even though the songs are twenty years old and some of them seem incredibly ridiculous, some of them I really enjoy. I&#8217;d love to replace the ridiculous ones with newer stuff. We&#8217;re far more experienced as musicians now and our tastes are wider.</p>
<p><strong>What will a Clag song in 2012 sound like?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m interested to find out. At a guess I think there&#8217;ll be some classical-type guitar thrown in, and some wiggly bits &#8211; we always avoided wiggly bits. Rachel also plays awesome flamenco guitar and I know she&#8217;s been playing her acoustic a lot more than her electric. And trombone seems to be featuring far more prominently throughout the sets. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting experiment, but I can guarantee the songs won&#8217;t be about goldfish or bikes.</p>
