                <h3>As Melbourne&#8217;s Hi-Fi heads north, <strong>ANDREW MCMILLEN</strong> speaks with Brisbane venue owners and various stakeholders to gauge its anticipated impact on the local scene.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3003848/429x375-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="429" height="375"/><br/>
Original live music is performed almost exclusively in Brisbane&#8217;s Fortitude Valley region, which lies immediately north-east of the city centre. Known almost exclusively as The Valley by locals, the area became Australia&#8217;s first designated ?entertainment precinct? in July 2006, when the Brisbane City Council moved to ensure the long-term future of The Valley&#8217;s music-based entertainment industry without &#8220;exposing residents or businesses to unreasonable levels of amplified music noise&#8221;.</p>
<p>The contribution of Brisbane-based acts to Australia&#8217;s music history demand lengthy exposition: Andrew Stafford, author of <em>Pig City: From The Saints To Savage Garden</em> required 331 pages to trace the rise of Brisbane&#8217;s musical talent from the 1960s to the early 2000s. Popular acts such as The Go-Betweens, Powderfinger, Regurgitator and The Saints have all proudly flown the Brisbane flag, while triple j regularly looks north for inspiration. Acts like The John Steel Singers,  An Horse, The Butterfly Effect and I Heart Hiroshima have all built their fanbase locally.</p>
<p>The Valley&#8217;s live music venues are located primarily on Brunswick Street, the suburb&#8217;s central strip. Several smaller capacity venues are housed on Brunswick, such as perennial indie rock haunts The Troubadour and Ric&#8217;s Bar, while The Globe and The Step Inn offer several-hundred capacity alternatives. Adjacent to Brunswick Street lies one of the most revered Valley venues: founded in 1992, The Zoo on Ann Street holds 450 patrons and is The Valley&#8217;s second biggest venue. Nearby on Costin Street lies The Tivoli, whose restored theatre space offers excellent viewing for approximately 1500.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3003849/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="330"/><br/>
The lack of competition at this mid-size venue range is one of the precinct&#8217;s few shortcomings. The Brisbane Entertainment Centre &#8211; located in northern suburb Boondall &#8211; and The Riverstage are high-end options for acts who can accommodate their facilities, which number around 13,500 and 9000, respectively. Following the mid-April closure of the 2000-capacity Arena &#8211; a venue which offered a sound alternative for touring acts unwilling to book South Bank&#8217;s capacity-flexible Convention Centre &#8211; the establishment of a mid-size performance space outside of The Valley became a popular topic of discussion among local punters. </p>
<p>Enter The Hi-Fi, the enduring Melbourne venue that will open a Brisbane outpost tonight (April 29) on Boundary Street in the southern suburb of West End (outside of The Valley&#8217;s live music hub). The Drones will be the first act to headline the venue, with fellow Melburnians Witch Hats and local act Hits rounding out the bill. So what impact will the 1200-capacity room have on Brisbane&#8217;s local music scene?</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:3px;">Shan Welham</h2>
<p>Queensland editor, <em><a href="http://www.fasterlouder.com.au">FasterLouder</a></em> </p>
<p>Having another venue of The Tivoli&#8217;s calibre here will surely provide scope for more, both local and touring, bands to play for Brisbane audiences. With the backing of a team that already knows what they&#8217;re doing from decades of running The Hi-Fi in Melbourne, we can only expect good things. It won&#8217;t hurt to shake the other venues up a bit either. Brisbane has some fine institutions here that we all love. However, a little competition for booking touring acts may be the catalyst for some improvements being made across the board, and for more local bands to get gigs, which can&#8217;t be a bad thing for punters or the scene in general.</p>
<p>A good live gig venue in West End is well overdue. There are some fringe-dwelling spots, but nothing with the pulling power The Hi-Fi will surely have. That being said, I don&#8217;t think the location will influence people away from The Valley en masse, as it is still this city&#8217;s live music hub, or ?entertainment precinct?. Having an option in West End will simply spread the love throughout the city a bit more as punters go where the bands are, really. The Arena was our mid-sized space for the more hardcore/hard rock touring acts. And as The Zoo seemingly has a policy not to present these types of bands, I guess people may look to The Hi-Fi and The Tivoli to carry the torch. Overall, I expect that we&#8217;ll have a quality live venue that has the name and organisational base to draw great touring acts to Brisbane, while supporting the local scene.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:3px;">Chris Harms</h2>
<p>Editor, <em><a href="http://www.ravemagazine.com.au">Rave Magazine</a></em></p>
<p>The fact that a mid-level venue has popped up to replace The Arena is good in terms of maintaining the status quo for touring acts requiring a venue of that size, but will it mean more shows empirically? It&#8217;s hard to say just yet. Its effect on local band shows depends on whether promoters and venues in West End get in on the location ?sea change?. Its location is likely to influence gig-goers away from The Valley: people have been grumbling about The Valley for a while, and I think a well-appointed venue in an area with surrounding food/entertainment/bars is going to be quite appealing to a lot of people. </p>
<p>I expect The Hi-Fi will become a genuine alternative option for seeing live music, provided the bookers keep placing acts across a number of genres in there. If they start strong and maintain momentum with a solid entertainment schedule, it would be difficult for The Hi-Fi to fail.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:3px;">Cameron Smith</h2>
<p>Blogger, <a href="http://before-hollywood.blogspot.com">Before Hollywood</a></p>
<p>Maybe another mid-size venue will mean that we&#8217;ll have a few less acts skipping over Brisbane on their way to Sydney and Melbourne. At the very least, I&#8217;m hoping that it will be a more pleasant place to experience such bands than The Arena was. In terms of helping out local bands, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll really do much for anyone who needs the help: if you can justify the hire of a 1200-capacity venue, you&#8217;re probably doing OK already. I suppose that&#8217;ll it&#8217;ll help a few more local bands get some moderately high-profile support slots, though that&#8217;s working on the assumption that The Hi-Fi will be more successful than The Arena, and that local bands are going to be given those opportunities.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3003850/440x329-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="329"/><br/>
I think that its location is the most interesting thing about the new venue. West End has recently started to become a more viable alternative to The Valley. maybe The Hi-Fi will highlight West End as a legitimate centre for live music, and perhaps encourage people to start up a Troubadour- or Ric&#8217;s-style venue in this area, something in the 150-250 capacity ballpark. Ultimately, I think that The Hi-Fi will adequately fill the hole left by the closing of The Arena, and, with any luck, surpass it in terms of the breadth of styles and regularity of shows. Anything beyond that is a bonus.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:3px;">Steve Fitzgerald</h2>
<p>Owner, <a href="http://www.ricsbar.com.au">Ric&#8217;s Bar</a></p>
<p>The Hi-Fi can&#8217;t make the local live music scene any worse. They have a long history of presenting Brisbane talent in Melbourne. Its West End location will make those Valley venues with little style and talent &#8211; the ones that promote Jagerbombs and karaoke &#8211; realise that an entertainment precinct needs more love and care.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:3px;">Anthony Osborne</h2>
<p>General Manager, The Hi-Fi</p>
<p><strong>Why the West End location, when the Valley has become known as Brisbane&#8217;s live music HQ? And how do you plan to attract people out of the Valley?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re in the business of placing bands who will attract people from anywhere nearby. We&#8217;re not really a ?drop-in? venue. We put on headlining artists in an effort to fill the room as often as possible. Although we&#8217;d like to be in a spot that has a good fit, at the end of the day, we can be a bit more flexible. West End is as suitable for as The Valley, because of the fact that people will come to the destination to see a particular headlining artist.</p>
<p><strong>And I suppose that the audience will hang around after the show and get to know West End a bit more.</strong><br/>
Yeah, definitely. We think that pre-show and post-show is important, as you don&#8217;t want to be stuck in a cultural desert. People like to be able to go and do something. It&#8217;s no sin to not be in The Valley; we&#8217;d have happily taken an opportunity in The Valley, but we&#8217;re very happy to be in West End.</p>
<p><strong>So you recognised a gap in the market? Did you think that Brisbane was missing a mid-range venue?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s room in all the capital city markets for professionally-run venues that have a good tech solution and a good customer solution. So Brisbane wasn&#8217;t missing a venue more than any other market. Melbourne has a lot of options for venues, but you still see people coming in and out of the market, and you see improvements for artists and promoters who want quality. There are some good operators in the Brisbane market, but there&#8217;s certainly room for us. Not that we recognised a gap. We see ourselves fitting into any market, if we can provide the right solution.</p>

<p><strong>The Hi-Fi has taken a few of the shows that were scheduled to be played at The Arena. Are you looking to occupy a similar market space?</strong><br/>
The live industry is essentially promoter-driven at that end of the scale. We can&#8217;t match the capacity that The Arena offered, but there&#8217;s certainly other ways to package the experience. If we&#8217;ve got turnkey operations and good marketing and ticketing support, then we can offer a more cost-effective alternative for promoters to use The Hi-Fi. This means that they can perhaps look at reduced capacities with a similar cost result.</p>
<p>We work on keeping the costs down for those who book the room. We think that&#8217;s the best competitive advantage that we can offer, in addition to offering a great live experience. It&#8217;s about punters and artists. If they&#8217;re both happy, then promoters are happy. The ultimate clients in many cases are the promoters, who we get much of our business from. To make them happy, we&#8217;ve just have to make sure that the fans want to come to the venue, and that the artists have a great experience. That starts with a good tech solution, a smooth ticketing system, bars and a great sight-line for all in attendance. </p>
<p>Melbourne&#8217;s Hi-Fi is one of the best viewing venues [<em>ed. when it isn&#8217;t packed to the rafters</em>] and we&#8217;ve tried to replicate that with the Brisbane Hi-Fi. It&#8217;s designed purely for live music &#8211; everyone will be able to see the stage easily. That&#8217;s the most important thing we can do &#8211; you know yourself, from going to gigs. All of a sudden you wonder why you went, because you&#8217;re stuck in a back corner and you can&#8217;t see anything. As much focus has gone into that aspect as the sound system.</p>
<p>The venue was previously a hotel for years, which did some live music, but in its last incarnation it was a pool hall. So it had a big space out the back &#8211; a big ?footprint? &#8211; but the inside has been custom-made to our requests. We put in a mezzanine, added a stage, tiered the floor and completely remodeled inside the building.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans to support the local scene?</strong><br/>
We held a promotion to recruit local support acts for the opening night, headlined by The Drones, which received over 200 entries from local acts. Those entries have allowed us to build a database of artists comprising many different genres who&#8217;ll be interested in support work. We&#8217;ll be pushing those into the mix whenever we&#8217;re after local acts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also be supporting local promoters who want to put on local bands. If promoters approach us with a desire to put on themed nights for whichever genre they&#8217;ve organised, such as a collection of indie, or hard rock bands, we support that by actively seeking these kinds of requests. We also make it efficient and reasonable for promoters to put these shows on. We do this a lot at the Melbourne venue too. Our main focus is headlining Australian and international acts &#8211; that&#8217;s certainly the ?bread and butter? of our business &#8211; but we want to be as open as possible, to support the local scene by creating opportunities for promoters and acts.</p>
<p><strong>How did the idea to get The Drones on board for the venue launch come about? And how did you arrive on the invite-only free show idea?</strong><br/>
We were always going to do a free show on the opening night, because we thought that was just a great way to launch the venue. The Grates were booked a week after the launch. We could have just opened with that show, but we wanted to open with an artist who is a good cultural fit for our business. We thought that The Drones were suitable for that purpose as they&#8217;re a great, artistic indie band. We approached The Drones with the idea and they accepted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing the free opening show to give everyone an opportunity to come to the venue. We&#8217;ll have a lot of people who won&#8217;t know The Drones &#8211; they won&#8217;t be Drones fans per se &#8211; but they&#8217;ll want to check out the venue. And these people might become Drones fans on the night, or fans of the bands who are supporting [Witch Hats and Hits]. We also allocated 300 tickets to The Drones&#8217; fanclub, which went like wildfire. But we haven&#8217;t limited the event purely to guests, as we wanted Drones fans to come to the show, in addition to letting people in ?off the street?, so to speak. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great The Drones enabled us to do that, as to some degree they&#8217;re making a sacrifice of their own by playing to a percentage of the room who aren&#8217;t necessarily passionate Drones fans.</p>
<p><strong>I read a news release that mentioned live video feeds and occasional acoustic sets in a nearby bar.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a standalone bar on Boundary Street called Vinyl, where we&#8217;ll be taking live video and audio feeds from particular gigs in The Hi-Fi&#8217;s main room and feeding them to Vinyl through a couple of big projector screens in the bar. We wanted to offer this as an add-on to sold-out gigs. We thought we&#8217;d take the opportunity to run the gig into a nearby location that contains venue-quality production sound.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had great responses from the artists, who&#8217;ve been very supportive of the idea as most of them realise that it&#8217;s an opportunity to spread their ?brand?. It&#8217;ll be up to the artists and their management as to whether they&#8217;re comfortable going through with it, but the response we&#8217;ve had so far indicates that we&#8217;ll be doing the live Vinyl feed quite often. We&#8217;ve done that with Jim Beam, who&#8217;ve been partners of ours for a while. They helped us pull the deal together, invest in a bit of production infrastructure and support it with a bit of marketing, without being overtly commercial. If we can get a good, regular roster of local and international acts who are keen to run the feed, then it&#8217;ll be great for people to be able to hang out at the bar and watch some great acts playing live nearby.</p>
<p>Vinyl will also be putting on some smaller ?side shows? where some artists will occasionally perform some smaller sets in an intimate location on a day surrounding their Hi-Fi show. These won&#8217;t be heavily promoted. Maybe a week out from the show, we&#8217;ll advertise that a particular artist is taking a ?lo-fi?, most likely acoustic opportunity, that suits their style. The venue has a small stage and a decent production set-up and has a capacity of around 150.</p>
<p><strong>I take it that you&#8217;re attempting to distinguish the Melbourne Hi-Fi from the Brisbane Hi-Fi.</strong><br/>
They&#8217;re part of the same group. We recently dropped the &#8220;Bar and Ballroom&#8221; part of our name from the Hi-Fi in Melbourne, and we tended to be colloquially known as &#8220;The Hi-Fi Bar&#8221;, which is wrong since we&#8217;ve never been called that.</p>
<p>Both venues are run by the same management structure, and they&#8217;ll very much work together. In Brisbane, there&#8217;ll be a production team, an operations manager for the venue and some other full-time staff for marketing and promotion. Although the main company administration is based in Melbourne, we may have some people representing the company nationally over time, while operating out of Brisbane. We&#8217;re very excited to get into Brisbane, we can&#8217;t wait to get on the plane and have a big opening night.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>The Drones, Witch Hats and Hits will perform at The Hi-Fi opening tonight (April 29). Free ticket allocations have already been filled.</p>
