Like so many songs about this so-called Great Southern Land, Laura Jean&#8217;s ?Australia? starts off descriptively; almost like an entry in a faded travelogue, or a watercolour put into words. ?Specks of light clinging to telephone wires,? she sings. ?Surrounded by desert pyres.? It could easily be a line lifted from The Panics? <em><a href="/releases/2000911">Rain On The Humming Wire</a></em>, an album rich with vivid descriptions of singer Jae Laffer&#8217;s native Perth; the ?summer with no end in sight? from ?Creatures?, or the peeling paint and brushfires in ?Not Quite Home?. But Laura Jean, admittedly, has little connection to these landscapes. They&#8217;re about as foreign to her, she says, as her ?distant sires? in Europe.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not clear enough already, this isn&#8217;t an ode to Australia. Nor is it a rant. Laura Jean may rail against planned ?communities?, the treatment of our indigenous people and their wisdom, the deeply ingrained cultural cringe, or a police state mentality that requires a ?stamped piece of paper to take a piss?, but her passion for this country (or, more properly, what it could be) runs deep. Constantly building in intensity, the song climaxes in a final verse, seemingly designed to awaken us from an apathetic slumber. ?We come from a people who risked it all,? her strained voice now clashing against horns and Jen Sholakis? pounding beats. ?We come from a people that broke the law.?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a stark reminder of the immigrant culture from which this country was born, and a potent shot in the arm for those who think we have it so great. And the best part? It was funded, along with the rest of the album, by a Victorian government grant. Democracy at work.</p>

<p><strong>Laura Jean Englert on ?Australia?:</strong></p>
<p>I was flying home to Melbourne one night and looked down when we were about 700 metres in the air. There was so much dark space, then thin threads of light-dots and clumps all gathered around telephone wires. I thought this was funny and kind of indicative of our culture. Existing cowardly in this giant land that most of us don&#8217;t understand, including me.</p>
<p>Like most Australian people, I was more excited about visiting my ancestral lands than exploring my own country. I was just about to head off to Europe for the first time. I thought I was going to get there and pronounce, ?I&#8217;ve arrived, I&#8217;m home?, and immediately start speaking German fluently like my Fraulein great-great-great grandmother. Even as I was feeling this I was quite cynical about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d seen lots of shows where artists from Europe and America would come here and kind of ?let loose? on stage, like they were in some kind of Oz where nothing mattered and they could get away with stuff they couldn&#8217;t back home. That&#8217;s kind of cool, but it&#8217;s sad that many artists from overseas see us perhaps as Dorothy did the munchkins, a curiosity. I wish I could tell the world how much progressive and amazing shit is going on down here. I wish Australians understood that themselves, especially politicians.</p>
<p>The second verse is about community and the city and suburbs stuff. My partner and I were living in the inner-city at the time and were a little weighed down by the aggression and bullshit. The ?me-first? mentality, the admirable but ultimately destructive protectiveness of Mum and Dad trying to get the best for their family and in the process shutting out the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s sad that many artists from overseas see us perhaps as Dorothy did the munchkins, a curiousity.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The third verse is about the tragic relationship between western and indigenous culture in Australia. I compared it to an infant trying to have a conversation with the oldest person on the street. All the old one can do is watch helplessly as the baby grasps and cries and fucks up, and the infant can only stare at the elderly person in at best wonder and at worst fear. </p>
<p>The last bit is an observation that most Australians come from people that took great risks and travelled a long way to be here. Now look at us &#8211; pathetically OH&amp;S obsessed, and more worried about a relative handful of people arriving by boat than the many thousands of migrants from the mother-country being welcomed with open arms. The double standard makes me sick.</p>
<p>Despite the many criticisms in this song, it came from a deep passion for this country, and an intense curiosity about the absurdity of being born here &#8211; a dusty western outpost in the middle of the Pacific. A culture with so much potential for greatness if we embraced our mistakes. If we allowed the mystery of this country into our hearts, if we had courage.</p>
