<h2>?Complete Control?</h2>
<p>This was one of the last songs written for the record and possibly one of my favourites on there. It was written around a drum pattern that I had in my head and I wanted it to be heavier in the verses and quieter in the choruses like many of the ?90s bands that were ripping off The Pixies. The song was written while I was trying to give up smoking and it&#8217;s pretty much about that battle, but it&#8217;s also about trying to live hassle free.</p>

<h2>?Panic Attack?</h2>
<p>?Panic Attack? was the second single we took from the album after ?Complete Control?. It&#8217;s probably the most upbeat song we have. It was pretty much a jam song that we used to stuff around with at rehearsal but never quite finished it until a few weeks before the recording. It initially came from a bass riff and the other parts just came together along with a sort of Broken Social Scene-style rhythm. The lyrics came last as usual. They are as the title suggests.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Should&#8217;ve Known?</h2>
<p>This is where the album starts to get a bit mellower. It&#8217;s about someone that&#8217;s made a decision to make a change in their life, but it sort of backfires on them and they regret that decision in the end. It has a pretty heavy breakdown in the last 30 seconds that turns the song upside down.</p>

<h2>?Good Advice?</h2>
<p>This song was written years ago before we started the band. It was written on an acoustic guitar &#8211; like most of our ideas &#8211; and was something that I never thought would actually translate into a band song. After listening to the War On Drugs record [<em>Slave Ambient</em>] it gave me confidence to be able to put any style of song forward for the record. It didn&#8217;t necessarily have to fit in with the other songs and it might give the record a bit more diversity. The song&#8217;s about leaving town.</p>

<p>#?Sunday?</p>
<p>This was a bit of an afterthought. We&#8217;d already tracked all of the songs but I really wanted to continue with the thought process that I didn&#8217;t just want to make a ?rock? record. I recorded this during the mixing sessions with Anthony [Cornish], and it was recorded on two battery-powered 10-watt practice amps that were stereo panned. This is about being hungover on a Sunday when everyone else is being productive.</p>

<h2>?Lights Out?</h2>
<p>The first track of side two of the record. A bit of a slow-builder that&#8217;s pretty monotonous and built around layers of guitars and swirly sounds. We don&#8217;t really play this song live that much but thought it still had its place on there and was a good introduction to side two.  It&#8217;s about getting too caught up with irrelevant stresses.</p>

<h2>?Love Song?</h2>
<p>Most people say it&#8217;s our pop song and I guess it shows off that I&#8217;m a pretty big Dinosaur Jr fan. It was a bit of a throwaway song at first and it came together pretty quickly before the sessions. This was the first take of the song in the studio and I now think it fits nicely on the album. I cringed when we named this one, but I guess it&#8217;s about someone that keeps losing stuff that they&#8217;re fond of. Not necessarily a person. Possibly our next single.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Only Sometimes?</h2>
<p>The heaviest song on the record and the one with the most guitar overdubs. I didn&#8217;t plan on it but it&#8217;s got three solos overlapping one another. It just sort of kept building into some kind of monster. I&#8217;m pretty sure the other guys in the band like this track the most on the album and it&#8217;s probably a bit of a live favourite for us, too.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Serotonin?</h2>
<p>An instrumental track that&#8217;s pretty fuzzed-out with heaps of swirly wah sounds. Nothing much to say here, but I guess we were listening to [The Stooges?] <em>Raw Power</em> heaps when we recorded this song.</p>
<p/>

<h2>?Same Solution?</h2>
<p>This was the B-side to the ?Panic Attack? single and it&#8217;s not included on the yellow vinyl version, but we still like it and put it on the CD/download version of the album. This was the first song written when we decided to record again and it&#8217;s pretty different to the other tracks in that it&#8217;s a bit more atmospheric and dreamy. A song about a couple going their separate ways.</p>

<h2>?A.M?</h2>
<p>This was the only song that we re-recorded from the previous coloured 7? records that we did with Jack Farley. It&#8217;s pretty different to the original version. Our new drummer Matt made the song a bit punchier and it&#8217;s been a staple live song for us since the start of the band a couple of years ago. It has a bit of a Sonic Youth/My Bloody Valentine/Jason Loewenstein feel to it, I guess, and it&#8217;s about looking forward to waking up the next day. I think it still fits in with all of our newer tracks, which is why we thought we&#8217;d include it.</p>

<h2>?All I Want?</h2>
<p>A song that has a bit of a Crazy Horse kinda vibe. About letting things go and not dwelling on the past. It has a last-minute guitar solo, which I added at the end of the track &#8211; I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t please everyone, but I think it fits well. There&#8217;s also a secret track that comes in at 12.45, which was a bit of a mess-around jam that we did at the end of the recording.</p>
