                <h3>Is Geoffrey O&#8217;Connor an unlikely pop star, or is the role a perfect fit for the erstwhile Crayon Fields leader? Interview by <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3040286/420x260-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I&#8217;ve interviewed Geoffrey O&#8217;Connor for <em>M+N* twice before: first <a href="/articles/3762681">upon the release</a> of his band The Crayon Fields? prowling second album, *<a href="/releases/2000417">All the Pleasures of the World</a>*, and then <a href="/articles/4347568">to discuss</a> his fogged-up debut solo album under his own name, *<a href="/releases/2000962">Vanity is Forever</a>*. This time we&#8217;re catching up with a quick phone chat around his second solo album, *<a href="/releases/2001372">Fan Fiction</a>*, which *M+N</em> reviewer Freya Zaknich described as ?an escapist oasis &#8211; just short of pornography.?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been fascinating to watch O&#8217;Connor evolve from the retreating leader of a jangling, wallflower guitar-pop band into a would-be pop star singing about lust and sex. He plays nearly every instrument himself on <em>Fan Fiction</em>, which he also self-produced, and he has directed and starred in videos for all three of the album&#8217;s singles so far. On highlights like ?Jacqueline? he turns his whispered vocals to a sumptuous feast of yesteryear synths, Chic-esque funk guitar and downright creepy undertones. He stokes dancefloor abandon on the whirring ?Another Time?, turns the closing ?Centre of the Room? into a sputtering slow jam and wields ?Is It Really Happening Now? like a dystopian synth-pop ballad.</p>
<p>At once subverting and saluting the most earnest, love-stricken side of past commercial pop, he&#8217;s like some culture-jamming crooner, corrupting the idea of a pop star a bit like the glitching holograms of himself in the video for ?I Never Cry?.</p>
<p>Before launching the new LP, O&#8217;Connor talked about his discomfort with collaborating and gave an update on the next Crayon Fields album.</p>
<p><strong>I know you&#8217;re doing production work under the banner <a href="http://vanityproductions.wordpress.com">Vanity Lair</a>. You&#8217;re doing your videos and you&#8217;ve done one for <a href="/tv/4650308">Amaya</a>. What was the impetus for starting that?</strong><br/>
I did my masters in film production. And I really enjoy making music videos. I guess I&#8217;m not ready to make short films, or obviously feature films, but I love editing and putting together little narrative sequences. So the music video is a perfect format for what I&#8217;m capable of &#8211; or at least, what I think I&#8217;m capable of. <a href="/search/?q=Donny+Ben&#8217;t"><em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s been great to put together videos for other people. I&#8217;m putting together one for [Donny Ben&#8217;t</a> now, which is good, and <a href="/articles/4545883">Jonny Telafone</a> as well.</p>
<p><strong>Was the Amaya one the first one you did for someone else?</strong><br/>
No, the first one would have been Early Woman <a href="/tv/4636250">[?I&#8217;m a Peach?</a>]. I just put them together in my creepy little studio here.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Blue&#8217;s a little better for blondes.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It <em>does</em> seems like a creepy little studio, between the name and the vibe of the clips. I mean that in a good way.</strong><br/>
Yeah. It&#8217;s all the more creepy now because I have a green screen <em>and</em> a blue screen. I needed to get a blue screen for when I&#8217;m shooting myself because I&#8217;m blonde, and a green screen for shooting the brunettes.</p>
<p><strong>This shows how little I know about it, but I thought they were interchangeable.</strong><br/>
They kind of are, but blue&#8217;s a little better for blondes. That&#8217;s a horribly trivial fact. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I guess blue screen and green screen came in handy for the latest video [for ?I Never Cry?]. It&#8217;s pretty bizarre.</strong><br/>
Yeah, that&#8217;s all green screen.</p>
<p><strong>The church in that: where is that?</strong><br/>
Some footage I take myself, but the church is stock footage. If you look hard enough for it, you can find royalty-free stock footage. But also I edit the stock footage as well &#8211; warp it a little so it looks a little more realistic or a little less realistic, depending on what I&#8217;m aiming for.</p>
<p><strong>It kind of freaked me out the first time I saw it. [<em>Laughs</em>]</strong><br/>
Yeah. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Vanity Lair is also where you record, right?</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. </p>
<p><strong>And it seems like you play most of the stuff on the new album yourself.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I do. Pretty much everything. There are some backing vocals on there, but apart from that it&#8217;s all me.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m more comfortable working on my own &#8211; I feel like less of a burden.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously you&#8217;re comfortable self-producing and playing everything yourself, but was there ever a point where you wanted to have more outside input?</strong><br/>
I like to occasionally. I guess I&#8217;m more comfortable working on my own, in some respects. I feel like less of a burden on other people, and I can really put myself into it. I can stay up very late and get up very early in the morning and work on it. I don&#8217;t have to consult with anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, it&#8217;d be cool to have a 24-hour place you can go to work.</strong><br/>
It is nice. My studio is pretty much soundproof, so I can stay up as late as I like.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have to teach yourself to play any instrument that you couldn&#8217;t play before, once you started doing this yourself?</strong><br/>
No, I&#8217;ve always been able to play guitar. And I&#8217;m familiar with music theory and everything, so composing synthesiser parts &#8211; I mean, I&#8217;m no Liberace, but I can play all the basics.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the status of The Crayon Fields right now?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve finished a record and we&#8217;re going to release that at some point next year, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>I know some of the guys have had babies, so I imagine that&#8217;s part of the gap [between albums].</strong><br/>
Yeah, exactly. We don&#8217;t really play live. We weren&#8217;t much of a live band &#8211; not in that we weren&#8217;t good &#8211; I thought we were a pretty good live band &#8211; but that it&#8217;s something we only do on rare occasions. And I&#8217;m more focused on my solo output. It was fun to put together an album, but it&#8217;ll be released around what I&#8217;m doing myself.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>It was interesting putting the two CDs next to each other and seeing how the presentation and your sort of image has changed. There&#8217;s commonalities, like the purple and the sunglasses, but it is a lot different. You look really young on the first album, which obviously wasn&#8217;t <a href="/releases/2000962">that long ago</a>.</strong><br/>
Yeah.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3039413/350x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<img class="r" data-src="/images/3022047/350x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>How did you want to present this one, uniquely from the first one?</strong><br/>
I guess I wanted it to be thematically linked. I like having myself and someone else on the cover. There&#8217;s kind of this duality. But I had this idea for the photo: I wanted to have this sophisticated, classy guardian-angel/Svengali figure who looked like they were kind of guiding my every move. And Fay [Hewison, the cover model] was perfect for that. She was a much better model than I was.</p>
<p><strong>And another thing: especially versus Crayon Fields songs, your songs are talking about sex more explicitly than your songs have in the past. Was there a catalyst for you, where you wanted to be more explicit talking about sensuality and parts of the body?</strong><br/>
Well, I like to think there&#8217;s some kind of classy subtlety to them, but I guess that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve become more interested in as a songwriter. I like writing about romance and especially the complexity of romance. I&#8217;ve always written about romance and the love, and that kind of thing. That&#8217;s always appealed to me. I feel like there&#8217;s endless possibilities for that. I mean, everyone has a very different experience of it. It&#8217;s going to be evocative for people in very different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. And when I said explicit, I didn&#8217;t mean crass or anything. Just like saying nipples by name, and there&#8217;s another line in ?Jacqueline? about getting laid, versus bland metaphors about love and being together and being apart. [Other people&#8217;s] lyrics are often very vague about it.</strong><br/>
I like to combine stuff that&#8217;s a little more vivid with something that&#8217;s a little more &#8211; for lack of a better word &#8211; poetic, and have a contrast between the two.</p>

<p><strong>The last time I saw you play live was when you supported Edwyn Collins [last January at The Kelvin Club in Melbourne].</strong><br/>
Ah, right. That was an amazing show. I loved Edwyn Collins that night.</p>
<p><strong>For the launches will it still be just you, or do you have a band?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a four-piece band. With Edwyn Collins <a href="/search/?q=Jessica+Says">who was singing while accompanied by two acoustic guitarists], we would have cramped his style if we had all gotten up there. I&#8217;ve got Jessica [Venables], a.k.a. [Jessica Says</a>, I&#8217;ve got Raquel <a href="/search/?q=fatti+frances">Solier], a.k.a. [Fatti Frances</a>, and I&#8217;ve got James Tom, who plays in the band <a href="/articles/4666767">Krakatau</a> and a few other bands. He&#8217;s a very tall, majestic-looking man.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds like a great band.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>?My main ambition is to make people in their 50s and 60s dance to 130-bpm music.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Are they able to depart from the arrangements a bit?</strong><br/>
Yeah, definitely. I like that aspect. I&#8217;ve never been into improvisation per se, but I guess when you&#8217;ve got fairly tightly structured songs, it&#8217;s good to let people improvise a little in the live setting. If you&#8217;re just telling people to play exactly what&#8217;s on the record, it&#8217;d be a very tedious operation. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Well, that&#8217;s the whole thing with playing with other people: their personalities are always going to come through in some way.</strong><br/>
Exactly. Yeah. And all three of them are very big personalities.</p>
<p><strong>You co-wrote two songs [?Her Name On Every Tongue? and ?Another Time?] with Alex [Burnett] from Sparkadia, and you were in England a bit working with him. How did that come about?</strong><br/>
We both have the same publisher, and I&#8217;ve [co-written] songs with other people [like Angie Hart of Frente!] before. I got approached about that like two years ago. I got an email about doing songs together: it wasn&#8217;t necessarily going to be for me or for Sparkadia. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m the most comfortable with, to be honest: collaborating with people. But it was fun and it was great to spend time in London and go to his studio. And he&#8217;s a really good piano player as well.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>I like how some of the songs on this record are pushing towards the dancefloor in terms of tempo and style, especially ?Another Time?. Is that something you&#8217;d like to see more: people dancing to your songs?</strong><br/>
Definitely. I think my main ambition in music is to make people in their 50s and 60s dance to 130-bpm music. I really love dancing, and I love watching people dance and dancing with people and making music for those people in that way.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to commission any remixes, like you did <a href="https://soundcloud.com/geoffreyoconnor/lawrence-arabia-remix">with the last record</a>?</strong><br/>
There might be a couple of remixes. We&#8217;ll see. Maybe it made more sense with the last record because the last record didn&#8217;t really have dance songs on it, whereas this one does.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Is there any visual element to the live show?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve actually got something pretty interesting planned for the launches. I&#8217;ve always had projection, light shows and that kind of thing &#8211; I like to make it an all-encompassing visual spectacular &#8211; but I&#8217;ve got a few other little things I&#8217;m going to add to spice it up a little bit.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I used that expression. I hate the expression ?spice it up?. [<em>Laughs</em>] I&#8217;m going to regret that for the rest of my life. &#8211; Maybe I just want my own cooking show.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s right. You can incorporate that into the gig too: appeal to <em>all</em> the senses.</strong><br/>
Yeah, that would be great.</p>
