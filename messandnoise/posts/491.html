                <h3>A song about Elvis sung by Elvis about Elvis&#8217; career, an obligatory meditation on death and a tune lifted straight from a Taco Bill ad &#8211; <strong>GRAVEYARD TRAIN</strong> lead us through their new album &#8216;The Drink The Devil and The Dance&#8217;.
</h3>

<h2>?The Devil&#8217;s Drum?</h2>
<p>Nick Finch (vocals/guitar): This is probably my favourite on the album because it reminds me so much of a Taco Bill ad. Come to think of it, so much so that we probably accidentally ripped it off a Taco Bill ad &#8211; do they have ads? I had the chords kicking around since we did the first CD three years ago but never quite got a decent melody or song topic going. Then I got high a few months ago and bam! You&#8217;ve got an album-opening nonsensical Mexicana song. It&#8217;s as easy as that, kids.</p>
<p>Josh Crawley (vocals/banjo/dobro): I got to play the bumpy wooden fish percussion thing. Mum would be proud.</p>
<p>Nick: That IS the best bit?</p>
<p>Beau Skowron (vocals/steel guitar): It&#8217;s a David Bowie rip-off that doesn&#8217;t take place in space &#8211; like I imagine most Bowie songs do &#8211; but more at a David Bowie concert. Pretty much about the first time you get completely fuck-eyed, completely get your ?dance on? and wake up the next morning thinking you&#8217;re going to hell for it.</p>
<h2>?Bit By A Dog?</h2>
<p>Josh: This was one of the first Graveyard Train songs ever written. We recorded it on our first album, but the song&#8217;s changed so much in the time since then that we thought we should redo it for this one. We recorded it live in [bass player&#8217;s] Chow&#8217;s kitchen about four months before we went to the country to record the rest of the songs. I was in the pantry with my banjo, Nick (guitar) was by the sink, Beau (steel guitar) was by the oven, Chow (upright bass) was by the back door, and Adam (hammer and chain) and Matt (washboard) were in the adjoining bathroom standing in the bath tub. Real pro.</p>
<p>Nick : I used to live in that house and we actually recorded our first album on the back porch. When you compare the two recordings, it seems the moral of the story is always record in the kitchen, not the porch. True story.</p>
<p>Beau: it&#8217;s set in a small fishing village on the banks of an American river, this is a song about the sort of kids who watch too many <em>Twilight</em> movies. I don&#8217;t know why either.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The moral of the story is always record in the kitchen, not the porch. True story.?</p></blockquote>
<h2>?Mummy?</h2>
<p>Nick: Josh and I were sitting in my backyard two days before we went away to record, lamenting the fact that all the new songs seemed to be a bit slow and serious. We wanted to do a schlocky monster number but it seemed like we&#8217;d run out of decent monsters to write about. It was actually pathetic: two grown men with a pad and a pen and a guitar trying to write songs about Will-o?-the-Wisp, the Abominable Snowman or the Loch Ness Monster, and it was all absolutely shithouse. Then, out of nowhere, Josh screamed, ?What about the fucking Mummy? That&#8217;s like, a major fucking monster and we&#8217;ve never done it!? I agreed, it was strange that such a massive player in the monster world had never crossed out minds in the years we&#8217;d been writing horror country tunes. After that the song pretty much wrote itself in about five minutes. Apologies for any future songs involving Will-o?-the-Wisp, the Abominable Snowman&#8230;</p>
<p>Josh : I have nothing to add to that story. </p>
<h2>?The Bones Do The Work?</h2>
<p>Nick: Matt wanted to call our <a href="/releases/2000237">last album</a> ?The Dog Eats The Cat, The Cat Eats The Bird, The Bird Eats The Worm and The Worm Eats You and Me?, which everyone thought was a silly idea. So we made a song out of it. On this one I&#8217;m basically trying to pretend I&#8217;m Mikelangelo (from Black Sea Gentlemen/Tin Star) and Josh is trying to pretend his banjo is a sitar.</p>
<p>Beau: It&#8217;s a more morbid version of ?There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly? that cuts to the chase where the rubber meets the road and tells it how it is. She&#8217;s gonna die. Not maybe. It&#8217;s gonna&#8217; happen, baby.</p>
<h2>?Run Billy Run?</h2>
<p>Nick: We came up with this tune the first time we were up in Tamworth. We actually wrote a whole version of the song but got drunk and lost the lyrics and by the time we got home no one could even remember the melody to the verses &#8211; all we had were the chords and chorus and that ?oh wee ohh? bit. We ended up going through a whole bunch of different melodies and song ideas about this kid Billy, but for some reason it took us about a year-and-a-half to come up with new verses that were any good. Idiots.</p>
<p>Beau: Who the fuck is Billy?</p>
<h2>?Lay To The West?</h2>
<p>Nick : It&#8217;s a song about a cowboy lying down and dying. This shit ain&#8217;t rocket science.</p>
<p>Beau : WRONG! This is my favourite &#8211; nearly. A song about Elvis sung by Elvis about Elvis&#8217; career. He was actually a righteous dude who loved his mum but got too famous and looked great in black.</p>
<h2>?The Ferryman?</h2>
<p>Beau: A song about the fact that you&#8217;re completely alone, even rowing to hell with a bunch of sailors. You might think you&#8217;ve got company and something in common with those guys, but not really.</p>
<p>Nick: Josh and I nearly killed each other over this one. I wanted to go all symphony orchestra and over the top and he wanted to keep it simple and sound more like Graveyard Train would in a live setting. Both just different interpretations of how the song could end up sounding. In the end we compromised, keeping the instrumentation real country but with a violin and cello underneath giving it some texture. We&#8217;re both happy. </p>
<h2>?Even Witches Like To Go Out Dancing?</h2>
<p>Beau: It&#8217;s song about over-28s bars.</p>
<p>Nick: Matt asked me to write a sexy song for the ladies. I obviously failed. It&#8217;s a pretty good song but there&#8217;s not a sexy moment in the whole bloody thing. </p>
<p>Josh: We all pretty much learnt this one in front of the mics as we were recording it. The recording&#8217;s a little rough around the edges but it&#8217;s going bananas when we do it live.</p>
<h2>?Let&#8217;s March Boys?</h2>
<p>Beau: It&#8217;s a song about a rather misguided group of drunken villagers from Poland who kill a sexy witch not realising she was the only one standing between them and an even worse fate.</p>
<p>Nick: I guess that&#8217;ll do. I thought this was a B-side for sure but I was wrong. This was the first song we recorded when we got there (some hall in Wandiligong, northeast Victoria) and it gave the neighbours a pretty good indication of what they were in for over the next three days. They looked terrified.</p>
<h2>?Ghost Train?</h2>
<p>Nick: Beau wrote this one about a bunch of kids who died in a suspicious fire on the ghost train at Sydney&#8217;s Luna Park in the late ?70s. Too soon? Probably.</p>
<p>Beau: A song about both the love and catastrophe of fairground fun rides.</p>
<h2>?A Tall Shadow?</h2>
<p>Nick: Another Graveyard Train song about death. One day we&#8217;ll change the fucking record! This is actually one of my favourites on the album. Josh wrote this one. It&#8217;s kind of tricky and bluegrass-y but really fun cause we all get to sing it together. </p>
<p>Josh: It&#8217;s always fun singing the big Graveyard Train ?ahhs? and ?oohs? but the ones in the breakdown of this song are by far the funnest we&#8217;ve ever done.</p>
<h2>?Funeral?</h2>
<p>Nick: I think we all had a go at singing this one but it suited Matt&#8217;s voice the best &#8211; he did a really great job. This is a song I wrote for a good friend who had someone he loved die recently. It&#8217;s the only serious Graveyard Train song that there is. This was the last song we recorded for the album. No one had showered in days, we were all hung over and everyone was so exhausted that the final take was incredibly slow. We had to speed up the tape a fair bit when we got back to Melbourne, which meant the strings players had to tune to some weird slightly flat G# or something. </p>
<h2>?Lover&#8217;s Leap?</h2>
<p>Nick: Matt wrote all the lyrics on this, apart from the first few lines, but had a completely different melody, structure and feel. It was much faster and more of a shuffle but wasn&#8217;t really working and we shelved it for ages. I really really liked the lyrics and concept so we reworked it into the song it is today. (Which was incredibly easy because it&#8217;s just over a C and G with the occasional Am and F). We had a kind of psychedelic, Polyphonic Spree-esque party time outro to our last album and, with minimal creativity, we repeated that idea on this one. I guess I wanted it to sound like ?All You Need is Love?.</p>
<p>Beau: it&#8217;s a similar story to ?Bit By a Dog? &#8211; except this time the kids are <em>doing it</em>.</p>
<p>Nick: Sigh.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>Graveyard Train&#8217;s <em>The Devil The Drink and The Dance</em> is out now on Spooky Records.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
