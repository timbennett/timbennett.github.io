                <h3>Former AMP winner Lisa Mitchell is more visible than ever, all thanks to one intimate song. We check in with her about her current tour and next album, accompanied by exclusive Polaroid photos from <strong>KIRRILEE BAILEY</strong>.

Lisa Mitchell is in the midst of recording her new album, but it&#8217;s actually her one-off 2014 single ?Wah Ha? that&#8217;s getting all the attention. The gently folky, demo-esque song has clocked up more than 260,000 plays on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lisamitchellmusic/wah-ha">Soundcloud</a> and earned her high-level US exposure via <em><a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6289230/lisa-mitchell-discusses-her-new-f-k-it-song-wah-ha-listen">Billboard</a>* and a <a href="http://www.npr.org/event/music/377222040/kcrw-presents-lisa-mitchell">live performance</a> on KCRW&#8217;s influential *Morning Becomes Eclectic</em> program. And just today she&#8217;s unveiled a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/seekae/lisa-mitchell-seekae-remix-1/s-dS5gN">disembodied yet dance-friendly</a> reworking of the track courtesy of <a href="/search/?q=Seekae">Seekae</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/news/4679048">Last December</a> Mitchell announced a three-city tour &#8211; presented by <em>M+N* along with *Yen Magazine* &#8211; around ?Wah Ha?, which will showcase an acoustic set with collaborator Tim Harvey (Team Harvey, Spiderbait) at intimate venues. Two of the three dates have already sold out, weeks before the tour begins. That&#8217;s quite a way to start the year for the acclaimed songwriter, who won The Australian Music Prize for her 2009 debut *Wonder* and released her latest album, *Bless This Mess</em>, in 2012.</p>
<p>We asked Mitchell a round of email questions around the tour, single and in-the-works new album.</p>
<p><strong>How will this tour differ from your previous ones?</strong><br/>
I love the difference between listening to an album and then going to see the artist live. It&#8217;s so revealing. This tour is just myself and my partner-in-crime Tim Harvey (Hot Little Hands) on guitars, SPD and his beautiful vocals. I cut my teeth busking on the streets of Albury as a kid, so playing live is something that I find both familiar and terrifying (and thrilling!) at the same time. Connecting with other humans via music is so fun. Humbling and messy and chaotic&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>How has it been recording your new album in rural Victoria?</strong><br/>
The album began with me, in notebooks and phone voice-memos, in my bedroom, in Airbnbs and friends? spare rooms, in Australia and London and LA. I asked Tim Harvey to help me record my demos in my parents? living room in Melbourne and aid in the delivery. (The last 10% of writing them into reality.) So Tim basically ?midwifed? or ?mid-husbanded? (?) the initial demos of the album. Now I&#8217;m writing these answers from the control room of Eric J&#8217;s studio in Sydney, where we have begun to record what will be the final album in a matter of months. Eric J mixed ?Wah Ha?, and Tim and I resonated with him so much that recording the album with him seemed like the most exotic way forward.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3041778/640x429-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s the album shaping up so far, and is it nearly finished?</strong><br/>
We had the coolest coincidence happen early on in the recording, where two of Eric&#8217;s friends (who happen to be one of the best rhythm sections in the world) happened to both be in Sydney for three days at the same time. Rob Calder (who plays bass for Angus &amp; Julia Stone) and Matt Johnson (who has played drums for Jeff Buckley and St Vincent) came and played a whole bunch of songs a few weeks ago. Such genuinely talented people and legends in their own right &#8211; so it was such an exciting few days, jamming with them and Tim and Eric. </p>
<p><strong>Does ?Wah Ha? hint at the direction of the album, or is it more of a standalone?</strong><br/>
?Wah Ha? is like the first child: bold, blindly ambitious and able to be pure and forward as they know no different. It is a bubble of the state that Tim Harvey and I were in when we recorded it in my parents? house in Melbourne. Bossa nova was haunting us and we just went with it. I just go with what feels good to me. Eric J then mixed and blessed it. Haha.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3041777/640x429-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p><strong>The line in ?Wah Ha? that really jumps out is ?I&#8217;m not your average suffering girl with a pencil in her hair.? Where did that come from?</strong><br/>
This line comes across as a bit bitchy (!!) but it&#8217;s not about anyone in particular. It&#8217;s just in everyone, I think &#8211; that ?suffering artist? stereotype &#8211; and I guess it just annoys me! I fell for it for a long time, but it&#8217;s totally ridiculous and boring. Everyone is allowed to complain, but really there is very little to complain about in these circles. Obviously some people in the world can&#8217;t even afford to feed themselves, or go to school or have infrastructure like a safe home/support/family/love. The next line, ?I&#8217;ve got gifts, thank you life? is about being grateful for what we have. I&#8217;m not really scared about sounding ?corny? &#8211; it&#8217;s just the truth.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been three years since your last album. What have you been doing, outside of music?</strong><br/>
My last album came out in 2012, and since then I&#8217;ve been, you know, living and shit. Perhaps my most notable achievements in that time have been: volunteering on an organic farm for two months (Transition Farm, Mornington Peninsula) which I loved; hanging out in Melbourne with my partner (Jordan Wilson of <a href="http://www.georgiafair.com.au">Georgia Fair</a>) and my family; running a Red Tent with my friend for a while (a women&#8217;s circle) which was pretty witchy and beautiful for my friends and I; spending some time in Paris and entertaining the idea of moving there (but deciding to try the English-language-and-world out for a bit longer!) and well, you know, lots of interpretive dancing and other weird stuff.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>You played two London gigs last year and performed ?Wah Ha? live on KCRW. Have you been able to make more in-roads overseas in the past year?</strong><br/>
The KCRW support in LA has been so cool; it was so fun. Tim and I flew over and played a set on <em>Morning Becomes Eclectic</em> (Jason Bentley&#8217;s radio show) and ended up playing a gig while we were there, at Hotel Cafe, which was my first ever gig in the US. I&#8217;m seriously looking forward to more touring there soon. We played some shows in London late last year as well, just to keep the poms happy! Gotta keep everyone happy!</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>You paid tribute to pianist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=mk2SNcpTNbs">Erik Satie</a> on 2012?s <em><a href="/releases/2001063">Spiritus</a></em> EP. Who have been some of the influences on the new album?</strong><br/>
I adore Erik Satie! On the new album so far, the influences are as widespread as Indian mantra music like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KrishnaDasMusic">Krishna Das</a> to Massive Attack to The Go-Betweens. Yes, as you can tell, it&#8217;s still early days. Haha!</p>
