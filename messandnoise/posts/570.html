                <h3><strong>RENE SCHAEFER<em>* reports on yesterday&#8217;s sweltering Big Day Out at Melbourne&#8217;s Showgrounds, which saw performances by Grinderman, Angus &amp; Julia Stone, Paul Dempsey and new local outfit Boomgates. Additional reporting by **DARREN LEVIN**, photos by *</em>MATTHEW HARDING</strong>.
</h3>
<p>Going to the Big Day Out has become a rite of passage for young Australians, but it&#8217;s testament to the genius of its creators that this annual event also continues to function as a great leveller among music fans of all ages &#8211; from bright-eyed youngsters to the most jaded rock dogs. Even after nearly 20 years, the winning formula of mixing heritage acts, current popular favourites and hip young up-and-comers, throwing some dance beats into the mix for the pingers, and presenting the whole in a carnival atmosphere, still packs in the punters. About 52,000 reportedly packed into the Melbourne Showgrounds this year &#8211; that&#8217;s a shitload of people!</p>
<p>The main drawcard for those with more than just a passing interest in popular music was of course the latest incarnation of <strong>Iggy and The Stooges</strong> &#8211; this time reviving the glories of their 1973 album <em>Raw Power</em>, with James Williamson on guitar. The man who once usurped the late, almost god-like Ron Asheton has been rehabilitated in the eyes of many Stooges aficionados since Asheton&#8217;s untimely death, so nobody was going to grumble about this being a lesser event than The Stooges? previous BDO appearance in 2006.</p>

<p>A large part of this festival&#8217;s attraction is always the local content though. <strong>The Vines<em>* were an interesting choice to kick off proceedings in the main arena at 11am, especially as they were going up against *</em>Super Wild Horses</strong> on the slightly smaller Green stage. It would be churlish to joke about the older band brushing shoulders with the ascending new kids on the block on their way down the ladder of success. Actually, The Vines? brand of meat-and-potatoes rock went down surprisingly well with the young early arrivals. Hands were in the air, shirts came off in the 40 degree heat, and there was a fair amount of bouncing about. While much of the set sounded generic, newer songs proved that there&#8217;s still life left in Craig Nicholls and co., with a melodicism coming to the fore recalling early Oasis, as well as the mid-?90s indie-rock of Even, Knievel and The Lemonheads. Who would have thought? Still, long sections of the set consisted of their trademark plodding grunge-lite, and the early enthusiasm of the crowd eventually dissipated somewhat.</p>
<p>Much fresher were <strong>Operator Please</strong>, who put in a blinder of a performance on the Green stage. Resplendent in fetching black-and-white outfits, the band were tight, energetic and eminently engaging. A super-solid rhythm section ensured there was absolutely nothing twee or cute about their bouncy pop. Having put in the hard yards over the last couple of years, singer Amandah Wilkinson was completely at ease in front of a large audience, and her guitar playing was fluid and precise. Vinyl-skirted violinist Taylor Henderson and blonde quiffed bass player Ashley McConnell were clearly enjoying themselves. Operator Please were perfect festival fare, with disco beats aplenty and the kind of songwriting chops that give one hope that commercial pop can still exert some fascination.</p>
<p><strong>Children Collide</strong> continued the theme of saleable pop-rock that doesn&#8217;t actually suck. The trio has well and truly outgrown their early influences and they played a dynamic set, which was buoyed by John Mackay&#8217;s slicing guitar lines. They made the big stage work for them, with the three-piece line-up allowing for plenty of space to pull songs back before exploding into hook-laden choruses. Their popularity is well-deserved just for their uncanny ability to craft perfectly concise rock, without the slightest hint of waffle or self-indulgence.</p>

<p>Melbourne indie super-group <strong>Boomgates</strong>, containing members of Dick Diver, Trial Kennedy, Teen Archer, Eddy Current Suppression Ring and The Twerps, played on the Hot Produce stage, which was thankfully canopied and provided some relief from the relentless UV rays and soaring temperature. If it is possible to be simultaneously frantic and wistful, these guys have nailed the formula. Guitars jangled away at lightning speed, while Brendan Huntley and Steph Hughes? twin vocals layered on the melody and bitter-sweet romanticism. Boomgates seem to have a patent on catchy tunes that easily rival the output of their antecedents, such as The Go-Betweens, The Chills, The Clean and The Bats. Yes, they really are that good. Even in a big tent they retained a kind of intimate charm and rapport with the audience. Huntley&#8217;s monotone vocal delivery was flawlessly balanced by Hughes? sweetness. The same can be said for her guitar playing which meshed amazingly well with Gus Lord&#8217;s harsher attack.</p>
<p>DL: <strong>Gareth Liddiard<em>* followed on the Hot Produce stage, bashing out some Drones ?covers? and tracks from last year&#8217;s *Strange Tourist* on acoustic guitar. His sound was somewhat muffled by the explosion of zef culture over at the Boiler Room (ie. South African hip-hop joke act **Die Antwoord</em></strong>). ?Fucking South Africans,? he quipped before a rousing version of ?I Don&#8217;t Ever Want To Change? from 2006?s *Gala Mill. ?Did you hear what they did to the black people.? A collective gasp followed before the punchline: ?We&#8217;d never do that.? More than just an adjunct to the music, Liddiard&#8217;s witty and often acerbic monologues &#8211; almost Warren Ellis-like in their execution &#8211; have become a defining part of his set. He ranted about Melbourne house prices and fat housemates before ?Strange Tourist? and sung a bar of Die Antwoord&#8217;s novelty hit ?Enter The Ninja? before ?Jezebel?. A reliance on more familiar Drones material may&#8217;ve reflected his apprehensions about a mainstream festival slot.</p>

<p>RS: In the licensed Lilypad area <strong>The UV Race</strong> put on a sublimely messy set. The BDO booklet billed them as a cross between The Electric Eels, The Saints, Roxy Music, X, T-Rex and The Ramones. They sounded like neither. It also described lead singer Marcus Rechsteiner as an idiot savant. He nearly lived up to that claim by taking to the stage clad in nothing but his favourite red jocks and confounding the slightly inebriated crowd with lyrics like, ?I&#8217;m a pig, oink, oink, oink?, as well as his usual non-sequiturs. In between shout-outs to their ex-schoolmates, UV Race shambled their way through a succession of songs that reeked more of high school bong sessions than pop sophistication. This of course is what they do best. Unfortunately, a slightly overbearing drum sound meant that a lot of their subtlety was lost in translation, but the band were happy as pigs in shit and managed to convert a few initially reticent punters.</p>
<p>In complete contrast, <strong>Angus &amp; Julia Stone</strong> were firm crowd favourites &#8211; and yet nobody knows quite why. The Hottest 100 <a href="/news/4177495">winners</a> drew a massive crowd to the Essential Stage. If nothing else, they confirmed the old adage that popularity is no indication of quality. What they played was lowest-common-denominator alterna-plop, nowhere near impactful enough to make any sense at a festival. Despite a full band, the momentum never built enough to really get the crowd moving. Still, the throng lapped it up.</p>
<p>Most people probably weren&#8217;t aware that <strong>Paul Dempsey</strong> had replaced The Black Keys on the Green Stage &#8211; the program made no mention of it &#8211; so his band ended up playing to a tiny audience of enthusiasts and a larger flock laying back in the precious shade of a few trees and a marquee in a sectioned-off bar area. Consequently, Dempsey&#8217;s brand of epic power ballads fell noticeably flat, despite a punchy sound appropriate to the occasion. It wasn&#8217;t terrible by a long shot, just too melodramatically overwrought to hold the attention of the passing crowd intent on other amusements. The mood remained ponderous throughout, alleviated only by a concluding cover of the Talking Heads song ?And She Was?, a song so incongruously danceable, it was almost comical to see a few dreadlocked hippie girls doing their best Kate Bush impersonations in response.</p>
<p>The lull in the schedule made it possible to kick back and ruminate on the general atmosphere. Thankfully, Australian flag capes were few and far between this year. Maybe it was the composition of the line-up, but overall the bogan quotient was remarkably low and aggro vibes were almost completely absent. Maybe it was just the heat though (temperatures were just shy of the expected top of 40). A lot of punters availed themselves of the plentiful free water handed around by security, and the misting domes proved a bigger attraction than the overpriced sideshow rides. Getting wristbands, drink tokens and beverages was surprisingly quick and hassle-free. There were hardly any queues for toilets, and BDO staff and volunteers were friendly and helpful in the main. For a mainstream gig (let&#8217;s not kid ourselves), this was pretty impressive. Naturally, there was a lot of sunburned bare flesh, but the naked apes generally looked like they were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Of course there had to be a downer somewhere along the line: ladies and gentlemen, <strong>The John Butler Trio</strong>. The appeal of this neo-hippie folk-funk wankery is not easily apparent. Spending nearly an hour listening to their stage show while waiting for The Stooges on the adjacent main stage, baking in oven-like temperatures, was enough to turn even the most mild-mannered indie types into raving misanthropes intent on wringing the nearest djembe player&#8217;s neck. Visions of a new Altamont were flashing through more than a few minds &#8211; and the band jamming overtime certainly didn&#8217;t help. It almost seemed like the BDO music programmers had decided to play a particularly cruel joke on the faithful followers of Iggy and The Stooges. Bastards. Still: The Motherfucking Stooges!</p>
<p>Seeing Iggy and his band certainly managed to provide a new context for the concluding performance of the night. Iggy is the consummate showman, an entertainer par excellence. Seeing him cajole and work the crowd into a frenzy put into perspective the latest incarnation of the closest thing this country has produced to an artist of Iggy&#8217;s stature: Nick Cave. With his noise rock band <strong>Grinderman</strong>, Cave has embraced the artifice of showbiz (the ?woo woos?, the goading on of the audience, the guitar hero stance) that previously seemed anathema to his persona as poet laureate of the Australian Gothic genre. While the Grinderman records are pretty hit-and-miss in terms of capturing this supposed rock&#8217;n?roll bacchanalia, it all made sense in the live context. </p>

<p>The first thing to realise is just how piss-funny Cave and his cohorts Martyn Casey, Jim Sclavunous and Warren Ellis are. Hell, they even inspired a male fan to throw a pair of large jocks on stage &#8211; an incident Cave shrugged off with polite amusement. Then there were the impersonations of buzzing bees, the ad-libbing of lyrics, the willingness to let things fall into a shambles on stage. This was Cave having a whale of a time. It was big, dumb, noisy fun, and impossible to dislike or critique with any sense of seriousness.</p>
<p>The crowd clapped along and hung onto every word during the extended middle passage of ?Kitchenette?. As the music was taken down, Cave berated the audience over and over. ?I just want to relax,? he yelled. ?Coming up the back stairs. Tippy toe, tippy toe?. One could picture Cave sitting at his writing desk at home in Brighton, while pesky neighbourhood kids keep driving him to distraction. It was hilarious. The band was a riot of low-down shaking bass, sequenced noise and fucked-up guitars. Not bad for a bunch of crotchety old dudes.</p>
