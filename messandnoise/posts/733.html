<p><strong>T20. Big Scary</strong><br/>
?Mix Tape?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000948">Vacation</a></em>)</p>
<p>In 2011, Big Scary delivered some great singles, and a slightly patchy album. Among the ups and downs, ?Mix Tape? was the moment for the pool room. Opening with a dusty old piano arpeggio, Tom Iansek mumbles his verses, recounting bored conversations with a lover that he doesn&#8217;t even like, let alone love. Eventually, unable to contain himself any longer, he bursts into a miraculous, widescreen chorus. The proclamation, ?I&#8217;m just bored, I don&#8217;t know what to do with my time? is almost ridiculously literal, but it may just be the most poignant lyric I heard all year. ?Mix Tape? manages to make suburban ennui sound both heartbreaking and glamorous all at once. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>T20. Oh Mercy</strong><br/>
?Stay Please Stay?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000859">Great Barrier Grief</a></em>)</p>
<p>Ever the jaded romantic, Alexander Gow is at his best when the romantic conflicts that populate his lyrics are swept along by his instinct for uncluttered pop melodies. On ?Stay Please Stay?, he interrogates himself, playing the jilter and the jilted. The result is a bouncy, maudlin draw. Needless to say, the melodies roll like an indecisive mountain stream, with a marimba, acoustic guitar, and not much else for accompaniment. Between Gow and his conscience, ?Stay Please Stay? just might be the best duet of the year. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>19. Circle Pit</strong><br/>
?Honey/Slave?<br/>
(From the 7? ?Honey/Slave?)</p>
<p>Just as Circle Pit seemed to settle into their chaotic, bad kid groove, and something resembling a stable line-up, everything changed again with the release of twin singles ?Slave? and ?Honey?. Stripped to a two-piece, the tracks unveiled a synthy, slow-moving, narcotised sound. It&#8217;s a lovescape of highs that don&#8217;t wear off and, eight months later, it still lures listeners into a teenage trace of repeated plays and dangerous desires.</p>
<p>Like two doomed lovers staring pupil to pupil, ?Slave? and ?Honey? are inseparable, shining brightest next to each other in their woozy cocoon. ?Slave? is the sexier of the two, taking lines most lyricist would never dare pen &#8211; ?Feels like I&#8217;m on ecstasy/Every time you&#8217;re lying next to me? &#8211; and infusing them with a morose sensuality alive somewhere between bondage and salvation. While equally sensual, with a strip-worthy guitar solo, ?Honey? holds an ancient sadness and a sense of longing for something even though it&#8217;s right in front of you. The seemingly banal line, ?When it rains it pours?, is delivered so heavily that it sounds like a truth spoken for the very first time. Sweet, sour and sultry, Circle Pit may have been born in the gutter but these tracks see them rise like bruised angels into a brighter day. &#8211; Hannah Brooks</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>18. Pets With Pets</strong><br/>
?Pixie Child?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000848">Saturday Aquatic Pixie Acid</a></em>)</p>
<p>Like much of parent album <em>Saturday Aquatic Pixie Acid*, ?Pixie Child? sounds like a marriage of every mind-expanding genre known to man, despite the track comprising little more than synth drones, a beat, and Zayd Thring&#8217;s unhinged vocal offerings. Bits of Neu!, Fuck Buttons, Roky Erickson (on a bad day), all poke through. The whole thing glides like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen">shinkansen</a> &#8211; even if Thring sounds mostly bonkers, and drummer Jonathan Edmonds? tangled fills sound like a mistake *every single time</em>. By the end, the weirdness has totally infiltrated, without it really becoming clear how or when. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>17. Gotye</strong><br/>
?Somebody That I Used To Know?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000933">Making Mirrors</a></em>)</p>
<p>Its domination has been so complete that it&#8217;s worth remembering just how unlikely a hit this is. On top of its tentative origin, we&#8217;re talking about a xylophone hook, a ?Don&#8217;t You Want Me?-style duet with duelling perspectives, some power-ballad catharsis and a much-noted adult-contemporary croon crammed into four minutes. Like the rest of <em>Making Mirrors</em>, it doesn&#8217;t cement Wally De Backer as a gifted singer or lyricist but as a gifted producer and arranger. Bringing headphones-encased art-pop to the mainstream, De Backer has proven a great leveller: the bad guys know him and they leave him alone. &#8211; Doug Wallen</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>16. Kimbra</strong><br/>
?Cameo Lover?<br/>
(From the album <em>Vows</em>)</p>
<p>In among all the soul and jazz inflections that colour <em>Vows*, ?Cameo Lover? is the indisputable pop moment, the shot at chart-busting glory. (Ironically, it was another cameo that got her there to the top of the charts, but we&#8217;ve already been there &#8211; see directly above.) ?Cameo Lover? is as shiny and sweet as a Kool Mint, polished to a high sheen by producer Franc Tetaz. It&#8217;s not just hook-laden &#8211; I count 12 distinct hooks, melodies, refrains, counter-melodies, lead lines, etc. &#8211; there&#8217;s a depth to the lyric, oscillating between coy come-ons and outright pleas. Still indebted to soul &#8211; check the doubled up drums, the horns and the choir of sassy Kimbras in the chorus &#8211; it sounds more of its time than the rest of *Vows</em>, and more importantly, it sounds completely, joyously uninhibited. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>15. Jonti</strong><br/>
?Firework Spraying Moon?<br/>
(From the album <em>Twirligig</em>)</p>
<p>Something of a sore thumb on this list, Jonti may be the most distinctive new voice to have emerged this year. On the wonky, loping ?Firework Spraying Moon? &#8211; he&#8217;s got a thing for surreal non-sequiturs &#8211; the LA-via-Sydney-via-South Africa producer set out his stall; avant-hip-hop in the Prefuse 73 vein, suffused with psych, and Jonti&#8217;s characteristic whimsy. Teasingly short, there&#8217;s a shuffling beat of tablas and fingerclicks, and a dizzying array of sounds that burst into frame, only to dissipate moments later. And that&#8217;s that. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>14. Lost Animal</strong><br/>
?Say No To Thugs?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000951">Ex Tropical</a></em>)</p>
<p>It feels almost barbaric to take a single from an album as unified as Lost Animal&#8217;s <em>Ex Tropical</em>. Like hacking a limb off a perfectly wrought statue. But ?Say No To Thugs? is as good an introduction as any to Jarrod Quarrell&#8217;s self-aware stylings. It&#8217;s sexy and lush but also creepy and cheap-sounding, channelling the lethargic sleaze of St Helens into a new setting that&#8217;s both open-air and totally suffocating. This is what people should mean when they say ?post-rock?: moving far beyond those same three tired instruments without losing a drop of badass swagger. &#8211; Doug Wallen</p>

<p><strong>13. Collarbones</strong><br/>
?Don Juan?<br/>
(From the album <em>Iconography</em>)</p>
<p>The underlying thread running through Marcus Whale&#8217;s lyrics is the overwhelming power desire has over us and our bodies, calling us into being but also splitting us up, leaving us spent and pliable; a lyrical theme perfectly matched to Travis Cook&#8217;s facility for making atmospheric, oddly sensual glitch. If this year&#8217;s *Iconography &#8211; the duo&#8217;s debut &#8211; mostly turned from the lighter to the darker parts of this lyrical and musical terrain, then on ?Don Juan?, Collarbones? carnal cut-up reaches its peak. In doing so, this song trips into territory than can only be called sublime &#8211; aborted sighs and drifting croons glide atop stuttering, shattered beats, as string samples blend imperceptibly into synthesisers, flesh and circuits in congealed rapture. There&#8217;s a lot happening here, but it&#8217;s all guided by a gripping, stunted rhythm that has a power over your body much like that of which Whale sings, ?Show me who to desire.? &#8211; Lawson Fletcher</p>

<p><strong>12. The Panics</strong><br/>
?Majesty?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000911">Rain On The Humming Wire</a></em>)</p>
<p>In a year which saw a televised royal wedding and a visit by the queen, the revival of the republic movement seems about as likely as a Tom Waits tour. But if Eddie McGuire and his pals decided to rally the Australian public again, they&#8217;ll have a readymade battle-cry in The Panics? ?Majesty?. Not that singer Jae Laffer ever really intended it to be. ?There&#8217;s only a few lines in that song that go down that <a href="/articles/4317410">pro-republican] path,? he told <em>M+N</em> in an [interview</a> earlier this year, ?but they resonate.? Though it may never become an anthem so to speak, there&#8217;s no doubting ?Majesty&#8217;s anthemic qualities: the shades of ?Wide Open Road? in the intro, a rousing chorus and, of course, those epic kettle drums. ?Don&#8217;t Fight It? may be their sing-along, but this is the signature tune they should play at every gig &#8211; Darren Levin</p>

<p><strong>11. Twerps</strong><br/>
?Bring Me Down?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000947">Twerps</a></em>)</p>
<p>On the Twerps? gloriously brash, self-titled debut, ?Bring Me Down? sounds like the point where Marty Frawley&#8217;s mask slips. All bravado on songs like ?Dreamin? and ?Who Are You?, ?Bring Me Down? is second thoughts, a moment&#8217;s introspection. It&#8217;s not necessarily the case lyrically &#8211; the song was co-written with Eddy Current&#8217;s Brendan Huntley, who lends Frawley his remarkable knack of saying a whole lot while saying nothing much &#8211; but vocally, he drops out of his reedy tenor range and into an earthy bass croak. A simple, beautiful picture is completed by a gentle strum, Rick Milovanovic&#8217;s melodic bass, and a sweet, gentle chorus from Super Wild Horses? Hayley McKee and Amy Franz. You can almost hear the band growing, and it&#8217;s exciting to think where they may go next. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>10. The Grates</strong><br/>
?Turn Me On?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000895">Secret Rituals</a></em>)</p>
<p>Patience Hodgson hasn&#8217;t kept secret her love of The Breeders, and their influence is all over the ?grown-up? third Grates album. Gone is the awkward puberty and in its place a snarled defiance and sexuality exemplified by this man-eating single (and arthouse film clip below). The alt-rock guitar squall may be patently ?90s, but this song isn&#8217;t about looking back: rather, it&#8217;s the homegrown radio hit The Grates needed to announce an evolved sound and a leaner, meaner, darker record. It also became a homecoming, as they returned at last from Brooklyn to Brisbane. &#8211; Doug Wallen</p>

<p><strong>9. Royal Headache</strong><br/>
?Really In Love?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000931">Royal Headache</a></em>)</p>
<p>Royal Headache stand out from the morass of shit garage bands because they write pointed (not simply fun) songs with great melodies and have a frontman &#8211; as their bio likes to boast &#8211; that can ?actually sing?. Like the Sonics? Gerry Roslie, or even James Brown, Shogun&#8217;s primal wail sounds like it comes from the deepest darkest pits of his tortured soul (or maybe he&#8217;s just good at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=eFpnPZpFTEk">faking it?</a>). ?Really In Love? plays out like an update of The Buzzcocks? ?Ever Fallen In Love?, but as cynical as Shogun gets, he&#8217;s still a romantic at heart.?

<p><strong>8. Dick Diver</strong><br/>
?On The Bank?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000956">New Start Again</a></em>)</p>
<p>Like a pungent cheese, the best Dick Diver songs seem to benefit from a few years? ripening. ?On The Bank? has been kicking for a few years in a live setting, which may account for the absolute ease with which the Melbourne four-piece deliver this lovely, low-key jam. Either way, Al Mackay&#8217;s slide guitar and Al Montfort&#8217;s bass counterpoint form the perfect backdrop for Rupert Edwards? sad little tableau. While waiting for a girl he fancies &#8211; on the bank, naturally &#8211; the protagonist falls prey to his numerous petty thoughts (?Is she going to come? Are those guys laughing at me? Should I start on the wine? Am I getting sunburnt??). Packed with lines as funny as they are sad, it&#8217;s a masterful representation of an Australian summer, in song form. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>7. Brous</strong><br/>
?Streamers?<br/>
From the EP <em><a href="/releases/2000940">Brous</a></em></p>
<p>There are few pop songs that keep you guessing from start to end &#8211; and that&#8217;s the beauty of ?Steamers?, which well and truly signaled Melbourne singer Sophia Brous? shift from her jazz beginnings to something else entirely. From a plaintive, sweetly-sung beginning recalling Wendy &amp; Bonnie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=mwHw6jo1E3M">?By The Sea?</a>, the track takes off like a steam train, hurtling forth with the kind of forward momentum that could so easily implode. But it doesn&#8217;t. Instead, Brous shifts gears again, momentarily donning a glittery gown for a dead-on Shirley Bassey verse, before roping in a Komeda-inspired children&#8217;s choir for the chorus. The ?WTF!? pop moment of the year. &#8211; Darren Levin</p>

<p><strong>6. Adalita</strong><br/>
?Hot Air?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000841">Adalita</a></em>)</p>
<p>?Hot Air? was the first song Adalita wrote for her majestic debut solo outing &#8211; nearly 20 years after fronting Magic Dirt &#8211; and its sparse instrumentation and themes of psychological exploration, loss and eroticism (?boy, I need your man?) really set the tone for one of the records of the year. Like most of the songs on <em>Adalita</em>, ?Hot Air? is little more than guitar and voice, but there&#8217;s great depth and poignant sadness here, no doubt compounded by the <a href="/news/3723078">death</a> of Magic Dirt bassist Dean Turner, who Adalita <a href="/articles/4211918">readily acknowledges</a> as the inspiration behind the album. The song may not be directly about Turner, but his spectre looms large, not least in the Adam Harding-directed clip, which was shot in the same seaside Victorian town the pair used to live. &#8211; Darren Levin</p>

<p><strong>5. Harmony</strong><br/>
?Cacophonous Vibes?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000901">Harmony</a></em>)</p>
<p>Trust dudes from The Nation Blue and McLusky to take the recent trend of throwback harmonising and turn it into something brutal and misshapen. Recorded as if from a hidden microphone muffled under a couch pillow, Harmony&#8217;s first album kept us at arm&#8217;s length from the rawness of Tom Lyngcoln&#8217;s wolf howl, the band&#8217;s caved-in catharsis and those un-gospel singers. As if it&#8217;d be dangerous to get much closer. But the songs came through anyway: a weird, exposed-nerve tug of war between the beautiful and the ugly. This single lives up to its name while hammering home Harmony&#8217;s ancient, earthy grit. &#8211; Doug Wallen</p>

<p><strong>4. Teeth &amp; Tongue</strong><br/>
?Unfamiliar Skirts?<br/>
From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000874">Tambourine</a></em>  </p>
<p>?This is a nasty and vindictive song,? says Jess Cornelius? of the first single from <em>Tambourine*, a record so good she effectively made it twice. ?Unfamiliar Skirts? is the ultimate post-breakup kiss of death; a song about a jilted ex who curses her former flame with a lifetime of meaningless flings and one-night stands ?until you finally realise I&#8217;m the only thing that works?. Ouch. The track showcases the almost intuitive understanding between Cornelius and guitarist Marc Regueiro-McKelvie, who play a neat little call-and-response in the chorus. Their dynamic is at the heart of *Tambourine</em>, and the reason why it&#8217;s one of the best records of the year. &#8211; Darren Levin</p>

<p><strong>3. Architecture In Helsinki</strong><br/>
?Contact High?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000850">Moment Bends</a></em>)</p>
<p>Cameron Bird has been leading his acolytes down this path for a while, but on ?Contact High?, AiH&#8217;s fetish for dirty, Prince-ish electro-funk reaches its logical endpoint. The snare sounds like a coke can being opened, the synth bass squelches, and rhythmic crossfire comes from every direction. Bird&#8217;s breathy falsetto lurks just on the right side of parody, despite lines like, ?Perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy? (he&#8217;s not talking about that shitty Guy Pearce film, is he?). It&#8217;s glorious, plastic pop AND there&#8217;s a key change. Too much! &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>2. Geoffrey O&#8217;Connor</strong><br/>
?Whatever Leads Me To You?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000962">Vanity Is Forever</a></em>)</p>
<p>In the retro-pop fantasy land that is <em>Vanity Is Forever</em>, ABC and Spandau Ballet are revered like gods, and ?Whatever Leads Me To You? is the latest James Bond theme. A clipped, slinky bass line runs the show, overlaid with Jessica Says? boudoir strings, and liberal portions of synth. Over this lush arrangement &#8211; it&#8217;s worth noting that there are few better arrangers in the country right now &#8211; O&#8217;Connor declares that he&#8217;s not above anything, begging pleading, crying. He&#8217;ll do whatever it takes, ?Whatever leads me to you.? There&#8217;s something quite striking about such a small voice uttering such large sentiments. However, the cocksure delivery gives the sense that O&#8217;Connor already has this one in the bag. ?Whatever Leads Me To You? may lack depth, but who needs depth when the surfaces are so shiny? &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>

<p><strong>1. Jack Ladder</strong><br/>
?Cold Feet?<br/>
(From the album <em><a href="/releases/2000887">Hurtsville</a></em>)</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s harder for the most lavishly talented ones; what do you do when you can go anywhere? Well, Jack Ladder went everywhere, looking for the material and the setting that would do credit to his voice and his songs. After digressions into singer-songwiter fare and taut, Motown-inspired rock&#8217;n?roll, ?Cold Feet? feels like a homecoming. Though he&#8217;s never really been here before, you can understand why he took so long, too. For a man that&#8217;s probably <a href="/articles/4279624">been compared to Nick Cave</a> since birth &#8211; generally unfavourably &#8211; a move into the ?wide open? sound of The Triffids, Rowland S Howard and (to a far lesser extent) Cave must have felt like an admission of defeat. However, there&#8217;s no shame in wearing your influences on your sleeve if you&#8217;re gonna nail it like this.</p>
<p>Instrumentally, the song is essentially Laurence Pike&#8217;s stuttering, gated drums, Kirin J. Callinan working sublime variations on the ?Brass In Pocket? riff, and a whole lotta wash. And space: ?Cold Feet? sounds like a lonely skyscraper in the desert. Over this comes Ladder, singing a valentine to his own indecision. His sometimes unwholesome addiction to similes actually serves as an extreme version of word painting, as he stutters, pauses and hedges his bets. When he eventually admits he&#8217;s changed his mind, he has to get Callinan to do the dirty work, bringing down the curtain with a graceful, minor-key lead line. He can&#8217;t even bring himself to end the song, it just fades and fades. Fully aware of the melodrama inherent in his sonorous bass voice, he takes great delight in undercutting it with witless one-liners like ?I wanna &#8230; make like a tree?, confident that his Dreamlanders (Callinan, in particular) will break your heart &#8211; even if he can&#8217;t be arsed. </p>
<p>In a year of pastiche, throwbacks, and tongues-in-cheek, ?Cold Feet? stood out as a proper, big, ambitious rock song, unafraid and unashamed. &#8211; Edward Sharp-Paul</p>
