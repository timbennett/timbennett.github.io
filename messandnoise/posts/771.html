<h2>Thursday 26 August. Bunbury. Prince of Wales. </h2>
<p><strong>Gig vibe: 4</strong><br/>
<strong>Venue treatment: 4</strong><br/>
<strong>Band morale: Good.</strong></p>

Two words &#8211; complimentary breakfast! After a hard night entertaining, the best thing for a dry mouthed, track panted muso is a super sweet bottled OJ shot and bowlful of cereal straight from the dispenser. We smashed the Just Right to the point of refilling. Mad Dog and Jeremy were spotted in their rooms emptying pockets full of butter pats and spreads. Win!</p>
<p>A photographer came to take our photo for a newspaper website. I opted for the juxtaposition of me in little swim shorts posing by the pool while the rest of the band rugged up for winter. I workshopped the idea with the Irish bargirl, who whipped me up an elaborate fruit cocktail to hold as a prop. The photographer seemed disillusioned and asked for a final shot of us standing in a line near the pokies. What&#8217;s with regional newspapers shying away from subversive compositions? I don&#8217;t think the photos surfaced, the editor horrified by our lack of Nova play and wacky band names which we fed the journo as earnestly as possible. </p>
<p>Bunbury is Burnie 2.0. Face value working folk, boot cut jeans, shop names with ?Z? in them. The surprisingly indie-cute barmaid, with European blue eyes and high cheek bones directed us to our rooms while Nature Boy and I quietly fell in love. Already I felt an aversion to the place, the dim light and callous exteriors forming a fist in my stomach. Tonight&#8217;s gig had been downgraded to a guarantee meaning there&#8217;d be no door charge, meaning there&#8217;d be no one there to specifically see us. Of all the towns I&#8217;d mentioned on tour, Bunbury was the one where people looked away.<br/>
?Good luck.?</p>
<p>While climbing the staircase to the rooms, I passed some youths in the beer garden below. By beer garden I mean goon nature strip.<br/>
?How&#8217;s your day been?? girl asked with scatty vivacity.<br/>
?Alright? I mumbled.<br/>
?Out of 10??<br/>
?Seven.?<br/>
?Seven.? She repeated, mulling the number over. My room resembled the set of a school play about biker executions and smelled like warm blood. I moped off to an interview with the local ABC, pulling out a version of ?Middle Aged Mum? with the place names changed.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m going to Busselton to buy a lady Remington.</em></p>
<p>Nature Boy told us he&#8217;d miraculously walked past cute bar girl going into her house. I suggested he go back and knock on the door.<br/>
?I know this sounds crazy but I thought you were really cool and I was wondering if you wanted to come out for dinner.? He shyly scoffed at the idea, stating she&#8217;d definitely have some miner boyfriend, which I assured him she most definitely would.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3027401/448x336-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
For dinner I sat in the bistro, disgusted that the choice of music in the establishment was the commercial radio station blaring ads. The gig was appropriately shithouse, and I was happy to take being ignored over hassled. During ?We Are Tramily?, the spiky haired young males began pulling mock-breakdance moves, as if threatened by the two girls in the bar paying some attention to us. My ego triggered. I countered by jumping onto the dance floor and whipping through a lively spaz-dance. </p>
<p>Boys retaliated by calling us faggots. Channelling the inner bogan that helped me in Launceston, I pulled out a ferocious barrage of counter-arguments concluding that ?just because we come from Melbourne and wear tight jeans doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t love pussy?. I then revealed, for the only time in my life, the number of girls I&#8217;ve slept with. I presumed my aggression earned us some respect, and they went quiet, sucking on their beers. During ?Acronymphomaniac? they put down their pool cues and swept onto the floor for the counter-attack. They staged a wildly acrobatic and energetic dance routine, cart wheeling and hand standing &#8211;  Circus Oz meets Oz.</p>
<p>I deduced that rather than compete with them, I&#8217;d support them. I whipped round and asked The Awkwardstra to make up some generic funk, a challenge I knew they were well capable of, (it&#8217;s the state I find them in after returning from the toilet during rehearsal &#8211; musical screensaver.) Band launched into some tasty P-funk cuts as I announced the inaugural ?Prince of Wales Breakdance Championships? and began a running commentary of Crazy Legs Guy VS Captain Shorts. The bout was well received by dancers and punters alike, and we had transformed ourselves from androgynous Melbourne wanks to all right knockabout champs. The competition was heating up, with Colonel Bumwalker doing a worm on the ground while Captain Shorts stepped on the stage and did a full back flip. He landed straight on Colonel Bumwalker whose face smashed into the concrete floor. I nervously commentated while pandemonium broke out, security and friends running in all directions. Biff seemed inevitable.  </p>
<p>Colonel was brought to his feet, blood smeared about his nose. I announced the end of competition and asked the judges to count their votes. We declared Colonel Bumwalker the winner and praised him for displaying the determination and bravery the sport needed. There were cries of protest from some competitors, taking it very seriously. No one was more focussed than The Colonel, strolling onto stage to make his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>?Try not get any blood on the microphone,? I whispered.<br/>
?I&#8217;d like to thank the these guys for coming.? He said with a dazed grin. </p>
<p>For the rest of the set the crowd paid attention and left us alone. We had broken the Prince of Wales mechanism. Confused them into submission. Afterwards, I was told that during Musical Clearance Sale, two blokes at the pool table had got excited when we started playing the ?Thunderstruck? riff, but were baffled when we sang ?Yeah Nah,? unable to determine whether the song was happening or not. Jim Trail, who recorded my early songs at triple j once said, ?It&#8217;s when people haven&#8217;t got you worked out that you&#8217;ve got their full attention.? For 20 seconds or so we had shut-down their world, holding them in the headlights of our white hot satire.</p>
<p>Good. On. Us.</p>

<h2>Thursday 27th. Perth City. Rocket Room. </h2>
<p><strong>Gig vibe: 2.5</strong><br/>
<strong>Venue treatment: 4</strong><br/>
<strong>Band morale: Low.</strong></p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3027399/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Our bubble of enthusiasm was pierced and vacuumed up by the cleaning staff. Nothing says congratulations on your performance last night like a thick-set matron of pain barking ?checkout&#8217;s at 11? while stripping a single bed. After a muesli and all-milk coffee at Caf? Same we let the WA sun smash our foreheads back into the van. </p>
<p>Highlight of the day, lunch, was taken at the ominously named Safety Bay, a drowsy seaside village 50km from Perth. Our nostrils were king-hit with a furious waft from the bowels of the shoreline, festering with sea-weed. I was baffled how the locals coped with such concentrated pong. </p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry, it must have been the sea. More tea Vicar?</em>  </p>
<p>We entered a grim fish and chips establishment haunted by the Pizza Chef from Pizza without the jokes or being a fictional character. On the wall was a photo of him with Chopper Read. The shop was fitted out with five near empty skill-tester machines, mostly containing cheap watches and fun-size Moros. After scouring the menu, I was taken with ?Sea Shanties? going for $1.25 and nerved myself to enquire what they were in aid of. Chief bared his crooked teeth laconically.</p>
<p>?Nuggets of the sea.?<br/>
I took one with a minimum chips &#8211; to the grave. </p>
<p>With whiffy gusts threatening to upend our picnic, we were set upon by seagulls. Mad Dog had a sea shanty plucked from his hand and shirt shat upon. Like most of The Awkwardstra his wash cycle was down to wearing merch shirts. Still fragile from Bunbury, this ploppy assassination took a toll, the good-natured young man growing darker than the rolling clouds as we dabbed him with napkins. I felt a sting of guilt as we trudged back to the van. The upside was the shirt design, a parody of Rage Against The Machine&#8217;s <em>The Battle of Los Angeles</em> graffiti cover, easily masked the stain. </p>

<p/>
<p>The gig tonight was in a hybrid nightclub featuring a long metallic bar clubbed in the centre, fascinatingly close to the stage. The Rocket Room traditionally serves as a metal venue, the walls wielding giant TV screens playing Foxtel. The band room was the beer cellar, making my stretching routine near impossible. This deprivation of a most basic personal space seemed a fitting metaphor.</p>
<p>The first support band were as loud as Safety Bay was smelly. I retreated with Hitz to the van for a nap. He was hitting his wall. With wedding plans and finances looming, the tour was proving a clog in his calendar. As he later noted, it was a time before <em>Angry Birds* &#8211; if only he could have experienced the visual therapy of flinging bird balls into increasingly complex forts. As it was he played *Angry Kiwi</em> &#8211; arms crossed, jacket defensively puffed, breathing like a kettle on a stove &#8211; hurling his feathered spirit against the iron fortress of civilisation.</p>
<p>All was people. All was noise. </p>
<p><em>Drum Perth</em> review: </p>
<div style="margin:0 0 15px 20px; color:#666;">
There appeared to be a strange annoyance in the air, perhaps because of the rare comedy at rock venue dynamic, but if that upset people then it&#8217;s their own stupid fault. Admittedly though it was hard to hear across the dominating bar. Sensing the mood, The Awkwardstra shifted back away from the social commentary with a ?Fuck words! Who wants to hear songs with drums?? Then, while a large proportion of drunks weren&#8217;t paying attention the solid outfit churned out funny stuff about drifting off on public transport, New-Media and Melbourne, finishing the set with the piss-funny single Northcote (So Hungover), suitably cool complaints to the sound guy and an indulgent number of tambourines. The Bedroom Philosopher and his talented Awkwardstra bode us a bemused goodbye.

<p>After aborting from ?Acronymphomanic?, I screamed at Jeremy to turn the sound down and for Jess our merch girl to bring me the earplugs I&#8217;d lent her. My patience tank was bone dry. I played ?Northcote? on auto pilot as some drunk uncle, beer in hand, clambered on stage next to Nature Boy. It was the ultimate betrayal. Even Bunbury,  with their course ways had respected our space. This crude breach of the fourth wall, our workspace, our meek patch of turf in the crack-den of Hades was a rough finger in our cupcake. During ?Song To Nod Off To? I derisively head-banged in slow motion as we played the timid instrumental. </p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t let them bury you.</em><br/>
<em>Wait till their backs are turned.</em><br/>
Stay alive. </p>
<p>We waited around for an hour-and-a-half to get paid. We had a 7am flight. It was past midnight. We congregated in the beer cellar, the only place to escape the frightful din, as the staff huffed around us. Hitz poked his head in, caught us with drinks and stormed back to the van. I ran a tortured course to the front desk &#8211; ?They haven&#8217;t finished counting the money,? elbowed on the way back by a slick enjoying the My Chemical Romance cover band. There&#8217;s nothing worse than ageing rockers &#8211; their craggy, chubby faces hopelessly at odds with their peroxide crowns. At yuck o&#8217;clock we grabbed the envelope, piled into the van and jetted to the hotel. Hitz drove in silence, his anger consuming the van, forcing more heat through my sizzling ears. I sat in the back, pondering the body language of the girl next to me, desperately in need of some intimacy.</p>
