                <h3>Melbourne rock/pop tradesman <strong>NICK BATTERHAM</strong> has played in The Earthmen, Blindside and Cordrazine. ?Closing Time at Yah Yah&#8217;s? is his second solo album, following 2010?s ?Second Lovers?. It spans a wedding song, a duet, 3am thoughts and the titular ode to Smith Street&#8217;s <a href="http://www.yahyahs.com.au">late-night rock den</a>.

<h2>?Who Can Keep Their Word?  </h2>
<p>I got home late one night and went into the studio to check on progress. I&#8217;d made a loop using a 1970s home organ to use as a click track. I started playing guitar in open G tuning over the loop and soon I was singing. I lazily set up a 58 on the desk, using my glasses case as a mic stand. I recorded about 10 minutes of live voice and guitar with the loop playing through the speakers. I didn&#8217;t think much of it as a demo, but friends said it sounded good so I edited it down to the shape of a song and overdubbed the shit out of it. It was hard to mix because the vocal, guitar and loop were all embedded in the one mono track. I have no idea where the lyrics came from. 3am thoughts.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Your Own Head (The River is Wide)?  </h2>
<p>Another improvised song. I was recording some piano on another song and, when I came to edit it, I found a line that made a nice awkward loop. I laid it up and played acoustic guitar over it, which I also looped. There are no chord changes, just the one note over and over. I improvised singing over the guitar and piano loops. I had the chorus lyric already. Someone had just told me ?it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t know how to use your own head.? Not sure what they meant &#8211; probably nasty &#8211; but it stuck. I chopped it down to a song structure and added some backwards noises. I sat on it for a while before getting Craig Mitchell to play drums on it. The drums were tricky because the timing of the loops is so wonky.</p>

<h2>?Own Worst Enemy?  </h2>
<p>This was written as a duet. The two verses are the two sides of being in a relationship with someone who doesn&#8217;t care for themself. If you love someone, it is very hard to leave, regardless of the personal cost. You naturally want to help them get better, but there&#8217;s a limit &#8211; a point where you admit defeat because it&#8217;s hurting you too much. <a href="/news/4616335">Amaya Laucirica</a> sang the female part. The pitch was quite low for how she normally sings, but it really suited her voice &#8211; smoky and warm.</p>
<p>The arrangement is simple: three acoustic guitars. Jethro Woodward played the main melodic guitar on a battered old 1950s acoustic. The guitar is a story in itself. Left in the attic of a shed for decades, it is warped and has cracks you can put a 20-cent piece through. I need a pair of pliers to tune it. Harmonically it&#8217;s totally shot, but the tone is unbelievable. </p>

<h2>?Sucking on the Tap?  </h2>
<p>I wrote and recorded this song on acoustic guitar. After adding overdubs I removed the guitar, which created a lot of space. At the time I wrote a bunch of songs in the same lyrical style &#8211; second-person, accusatory tone &#8211; once upon a time you dressed so fine, threw the bums a dime, in your prime, didn&#8217;t you? I find it easier to write about myself if I take an outsider&#8217;s view and accuse myself of things.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Love is a Dream?  </h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve played this song at a couple of weddings. Folks must think it celebrates the magic of love. When I wrote it I wanted to set up the stereotypical ?one true love? concept and then slap it down with a chorus line of ?love is a dream.? I guess it can be read both ways. Love is dreamy, or else you are dreaming if you think love can be all you hope for.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2097927784/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=5/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://popboomerangrecords.bandcamp.com/album/pb094-nick-batterham-closing-time-at-yah-yah-s-pre-order">(PB094) Nick Batterham: Closing Time At Yah Yah&#8217;s (Pre-order) by Popboomerang Records</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Help Me Do Right This Time?  </h2>
<p>I recorded this song many times and wasn&#8217;t happy with it. It&#8217;s the curse of liking a song and wanting to do it justice, plus having too much time on your hands. I knew it needed to be a live vocal-and-guitar take; I just couldn&#8217;t get it right. Once I got it, I added piano and Ida Duelund Hansen played double bass. The lyrics, like the title, are self-explanatory. </p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2097927784/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=6/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://popboomerangrecords.bandcamp.com/album/pb094-nick-batterham-closing-time-at-yah-yah-s-pre-order">(PB094) Nick Batterham: Closing Time At Yah Yah&#8217;s (Pre-order) by Popboomerang Records</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Out of Control?  </h2>
<p>I&#8217;d rented out my studio for a few weeks so I set up a temporary recording rig in my spare bedroom. The room was empty so it had a sympathetic reverb that made it forgiving to sing in. I sang the vocal live with the guitar to a click, which I don&#8217;t usually do. At first I improvised for about half an hour. I listened back and refined the lyrics into a song structure then had another go. I ran the acoustic guitar through an amp with a soft tremolo, mainly because I was worried about traffic noise.</p>
<p>From start to finish the song was written and recorded in about an hour. I sat on it for a year before adding drums. I played e-bow electric guitar all over it, getting off on making crazy noises, but I ended up cutting it all out except for a couple of bits near the end. It was a bit of a wankfest.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2097927784/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=7/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://popboomerangrecords.bandcamp.com/album/pb094-nick-batterham-closing-time-at-yah-yah-s-pre-order">(PB094) Nick Batterham: Closing Time At Yah Yah&#8217;s (Pre-order) by Popboomerang Records</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Nice Things (Do My Head In)?  </h2>
<p>This is another live vocal-and-guitar take. I actually recorded it when I made my <a href="http://www.headrecords.com/cms-head-records/second-lovers-nick-batterham.phps">previous record</a>. It didn&#8217;t make the cut because it felt too twee. This time around it sat with the other songs OK. It&#8217;s a love song of sorts &#8211; one where you ask your lover not to say crazy shit while you&#8217;re trying to bang them.</p>

<h2>?Tall and Pretty?  </h2>
<p>My friend was on the phone to a friend who had just been through a breakup. I tried to offer some consolation by saying at least she was still tall and pretty. The line stuck and I wrote the song around it. Again, it has the second-person, accusatory tone.</p>

<h2>?All the Things I Do?  </h2>
<p>This was the last song I wrote for the record. I&#8217;d already finished mixing most of the other songs and then this one came along. I&#8217;d been playing a lot of Townes Van Zandt because I was performing an album of his <a href="http://purepop.com.au">1969?s <em>Our Mother the Mountain</em>] at [Pure Pop Records</a>. I like how he describes elements of nature, so I wrote the verses as if I was God, the creator of all things, then turned it on its head with the chorus, saying I made everything just ?to be worthy of you.? I don&#8217;t know who the ?you? is and I am no God.</p>
<p>I recorded it on guitar but then, when I added all the atmospherics, I removed the guitar and it sounded much better. It takes a leap of faith to ditch the instrument you write a song on, but it&#8217;s often for the best.</p>

<h2>?Last Point?  </h2>
<p>This was written a very long time ago. It&#8217;s about trying to quit something. I&#8217;ve mixed it a few times. This time I ran the vocals and piano through a Leslie speaker and couple of guitar amps, which helped me like the song again. </p>

<h2>?Closing Time at Yah Yah&#8217;s?  </h2>
<p>This is the only full-band song on the record. The vocal, piano and guitars were tracked live and then the drums and bass were overdubbed. With my modest piano skills, I still struggle to get the chords right when I play it. Lyrically, it is as the title suggests &#8211; stumbling thoughts at the end of a big night on the piss. Should I stay and leer at people, or should I just go home to bed? Too pissed to decide.</p>
