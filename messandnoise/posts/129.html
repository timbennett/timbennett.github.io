                <h3>In part two, <strong>DAVE MCCORMACK</strong> talks to Angie Hart about bowel movements, staying sane on the road and her obsession with crossword puzzles. Read <a href="/articles/3188132">part one here</a>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3000916/430x560-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="430" height="560"/><br/>
<em>Dave: If you were to be included in children&#8217;s bedtime story, what sort of character would you be and what would your name be?</em></p>
<p>Angie: In the story of <em>The Strange Noises of Princess Angular</em>, we follow our protagonist as she burps, farts and coughs resonantly through the many splendiferous and uniquely different cavernous ballrooms of the east coast of Australia. Attended by only the cr&#8217;me de la cr&#8217;me of the southern hemisphere, no-one would guess that such vulgar and tasteless sounds could emit from such a princess. Which would be unforgivable, were it not for her gift of song. When she sings, the oompah-pah of all other emissions cease and the music begins.</p>
<p><em>Dave: If you start drinking in the early afternoon before a show, how do you manage to stay sober enough to play later that evening?</em></p>
<p>Angie: Even though I have been documented in song and print media as quite the drinker, I never drank before a show. Until recently. Since I have broken my AFG (alcohol free gig) rule, I try to stick to a cut-off time which begins at the end of sound-check. This has only been challenged once, at the Little Creatures brewery in Fremantle. It is a persuasive ale that won&#8217;t take ?no? for an answer. This is when a level-headed guitarist can be helpful. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the drunkenness if I continue, or the weariness if I stop, that I fear most.</p>
<p><em>Dave: When you are on tour, do you pass strangers? houses in the early evening and wish that you could just walk straight in and join them for dinner?</em></p>
<p>Angie: I am a sucker for a lamp-lit window in a stranger&#8217;s house. They are so full of promise. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I would make my (ex)husband drive me around the hills, so I could look into people&#8217;s windows.</p>
<blockquote><p>None of the things I do on the road are out of the ordinary for being on the road. I swear like a trooper, talk incessantly about bowel movements (not particularly mine), and collect packaging with improper English slogans.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Dave: Are you a gambler?</em></p>
<p>Angie: I do have a touch of the compulsive/obsessive about me, but it&#8217;s more for crosswords.</p>
<p><em>Dave: Any surprising behaviour I can expect from you as we travel from place to place?</em></p>
<p>Angie: None of the things I do on the road are out of the ordinary for being on the road. I swear like a trooper, talk incessantly about bowel movements (not particularly mine), and collect packaging with improper English slogans. The rest of the time, I don&#8217;t say much and can be found huddled in a corner somewhere with the crossword.</p>
<p><em>Dave: I heard someone say the following: ?The happiest time of my life was when I went to the bank with my brother?. I find that beautiful. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Angie: I don&#8217;t have a brother, but I once overheard a woman on a train berating her partner for sitting on the seat opposite from her during their journey to Footscray. She called him a ?backwards man?. It was touching. Another was from a 19-year-old woman at a truck stop in Virginia, who after enquiring about my accent, exclaimed wistfully, ?Australia, I always wanted to go there.? I found her use of past-tense sad.</p>
<p><em>Dave: Do you write your best music when you are happy or unhappy?</em></p>
<p>Angie: My best songs are sad songs with a silver lining, or happy songs with a dark underbelly. I seem to write them, no matter what my mood.</p>
<p><em>Dave: Any tips for keeping healthy and sane on the road?</em></p>
<p>Angie: A healthy devil-may-care attitude, a large dose of the non-judgies, and lots of vegetables. if all else fails, and you find yourself ill of body and ill of mind, I suggest a shot of Drambuie (no ice), sipped at a leisurely measure.</p>
<p><em>Dave: Can you play an instrument in my new band?</em></p>
<p>Angie: Can I play kazoo? I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m a terrible player of most instruments, and I&#8217;m not being modest.</p>
<p><em>Dave: What was the name of your grade one teacher and has he/she attained some sort of mythical status in your mind?</em></p>
<p>Angie: There was a year three teacher at Gold Street Primary, whose name escapes me, so let&#8217;s call her Ms Moneypenny. She never taught me, and it was my wish that she had. I would see her around my neighbourhood, walking a pair of Dalmatians with her rock&#8217;n?roll boyfriend. The fact that she wasn&#8217;t married and that she dyed her boyfriend&#8217;s hair yellow and he dyed hers black, made her a desirable enigma. To top it all off, she had a vast collection of vintage sunglasses that she would doctor with coloured contact on the lenses to match her outfits. I was 10 years old, this seemed the ultimate to me and still does.</p>
<p><em>Dave: Of all of your songs, what is the one you are most proud of?</em></p>
<p>Angie: There are a couple of songs on my first solo album that I&#8217;m proud of having the balls to write, but they are still difficult to perform in some situations due to the vulnerable subject matter (me). In answer to those songs, I find &#8216;Don&#8217;t Be Shy&#8217; comforting and assertive. It&#8217;s something I am happy to share with people and hope that it makes them feel some of what I felt at that time. I&#8217;d be proud of that.</p>
