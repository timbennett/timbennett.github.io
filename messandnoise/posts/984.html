                <h3>Author, bartender and prolific member of bands Nathan Roche sits down with <strong>MITCHELL JUDGE</strong> to discuss one of those bands, Sydney&#8217;s breezy Camperdown &amp; Out, who have just released their first album.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3034965/450x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I arrive at the Old Fitzroy in Woolloomooloo, where Camperdown &amp; Out lead singer Nathan Roche steps out from behind the bar to answer my questions over a few beers. He enjoys pulling drinks here all day, although the great majority of his customers are more than twice his age.</p>
<p>Despite being a few train stops away from the actual Camperdown, the quiet rundown pub is a fitting location given the relaxed sound of the band&#8217;s debut album, featuring members of Royal Headache, Dead Farmers, Raw Prawn and Marf Loth. We chat about this new Sydney ?supergroup,? Rocher&#8217;s other projects and whether he cares about any of them at all.</p>
<p><strong>Camperdown &amp; Out started as a laugh between a couple of mates, so how did you meet the other members of the band?</strong><br/>
When I moved to Sydney in late 2008, I had always liked music of course so I just started going to gigs and meeting people. I was living with the <a href="/articles/4552611">Bed Wettin? Bad Boys</a> on Kirk Street, and I met [bassist] Dave [Akerman] one night there at a New Year&#8217;s Eve party and [drummer] Shortty through Royal Headache. Yeah, pretty much it was all at gigs. Simple as that, actually.</p>
<p><strong>How was the change for you, coming down from Townsville to Sydney?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it was pretty massive: I hadn&#8217;t ever worn jeans until I moved to Sydney. I mean really Townsville is nothing; it&#8217;s the complete opposite of Sydney. Actually I shouldn&#8217;t be so harsh on it because there was a good scene up there with our friends. I used to live in this hellhole crack den right in the city of Townsville with all of these graffiti artists and we all used to put on gigs.</p>
<blockquote><p>?You might as well write about where you&#8217;re from because people can relate to it. And it&#8217;s good for tourism!?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Was that an influence on your lyrics? With songs like ?Manly? and ?South Coast?, the album seems to be quite focused on Sydney.</strong><br/>
Well, even in Marf Loth some of the lyrics would be about Australian towns. I guess my songs will always be set in Australia, because that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m from. It&#8217;s where the whole band is from. I&#8217;ve written books as well, and they are all set in Australia: in Sydney or Adelaide or Townsville. You might as well write about where you&#8217;re from because people can relate to it, and I think it gives it a cultural image and relevance. And it&#8217;s good for tourism! When I read <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A<em>Confederacy</em>of_Dunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em> it made me want to go to New Orleans.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Do you think there&#8217;s enough Sydney or Australian bands singing about their hometown?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t think so. I mean, back in the day you would hear it, and I think it might be coming back now. I know <a href="http://beefjerk.bandcamp.com">Beef Jerk</a> sing about Sydney as well, but I don&#8217;t know of any other bands that do. No one has to though, but I think some people should.</p>
<p><strong>You establish that Sydney connection right away with a name like Camperdown &amp; Out.</strong><br/>
Yeah, well, with the name, I don&#8217;t know &#8211; all of our music&#8217;s pretty self-deprecating, and I do it for fun and really just don&#8217;t care. I think everything&#8217;s a joke, and that name is just a joke. So the band to me is a joke. [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p><strong>That comes across a little in the subject matter of <em>Couldn&#8217;t Be Better</em>, I think. Especially compared to some other jangle bands like Bitch Prefect, this album is quite lighthearted and optimistic.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I try not to think about lyrics too much, and I think I always write about the same shit: whether it&#8217;s in this band or another band it&#8217;s all the same. If something rhymes I write it; it&#8217;s all about rhyming. But I can&#8217;t really speak on behalf of Alex [Kiers] because he wrote four songs, which I really liked. It&#8217;s good not having an entire record of myself. I really enjoy listening to his songs because it adds a bit of variety. </p>
<blockquote><p>?For me it&#8217;s always been the same: John Cale, Lou Reed and Alex Chilton.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you see yourself fitting in with that <a href="/articles/4517534">jangle sound</a> that is quite popular now?</strong><br/>
Well that&#8217;s the thing &#8211; when I read that press release with our influences [The Go-Betweens, Ed Kuepper, Paul Kelly, The Clean], I was thinking ?I love Paul Kelly but I really don&#8217;t know anything about The Clean or The Verlaines.? If there are any influences, and I know it would be different for Alex, but for me it&#8217;s always been the same: John Cale, Lou Reed and Alex Chilton.</p>
<p>But in saying that, it might be easier to just mention the bands that people are relating to at the moment. I don&#8217;t think we sound like The Clean at all, but hey maybe I&#8217;m wrong. Actually you know the actor Elliott Gould, his voice has been more inspirational to me than any band. And Lee Hazelwood is all you need in life. </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_u0uo0TxS-I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Do you think it was tough for the other guys to strip back some of the layers and release an album that is so different sounding to their other material?</strong><br/>
Well, yeah, this is the polar opposite to <a href="http://deadfarmers.bandcamp.com">Dead Farmers</a>, but Dead Farmers is one of the best live bands in the country and I&#8217;ve been saying that since I first saw them. And for Dave, that&#8217;s always been his band and he&#8217;s always had a distortion pedal. So I think it&#8217;s nice for Alex and Dave to mix it up and have an interesting contrast.</p>
<p>The good thing about people who are obsessed with music is that they love all kinds of music: you&#8217;ll listen to The Dead C and then you&#8217;ll listen to Donovan or something. The more music you&#8217;re into, the more music you want to make. So for me it&#8217;s like ?Hey Alex, do you want to play in this band, it&#8217;s kind of like The dB&#8217;s or Lou Reed?? and he&#8217;ll be totally on board with it. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3034966/400x275-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Was there a point where it changed from just being a laugh between mates to thinking that you could take it more seriously?</strong><br/>
Not for me. I was hesitant to do any signing to a label because I just don&#8217;t care about anything. I don&#8217;t care about being successful, or playing with the right people or having people at our shows. I just do it for fun.</p>
<p>And the reason that I wanted to be in Camperdown &amp; Out is because they&#8217;re nice people, so still at no point now am I taking it seriously. I know the record label probably want us to, but it&#8217;s just fun for now, and when it&#8217;s not fun it will be over. I don&#8217;t know how long it will last, but at least we got one record out: there&#8217;s some sort of legacy in a catalogue number. </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mbnGPAlStWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>So did you even want to sign to Popfrenzy?</strong><br/>
Well, I was the one who probably took the most convincing to want to do it, and that&#8217;s got nothing to do with Popfrenzy. I&#8217;ve done interning at Spunk, and I think independent labels are incredible; they&#8217;re there to help you. But I just have a lack of commitment to things, and by signing to that label you&#8217;re expected to work together and I just don&#8217;t care enough. I feel like I&#8217;m letting them down by not being ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>I was surprised that you didn&#8217;t go through R.I.P. Society, because of their history with Royal Headache, Dead Farmers and now Raw Prawn.</strong><br/>
Oh don&#8217;t get me started on that! [<em>Laughs</em>] I remember living with Nic [Warnock] and the day that the first Circle Pit 7?s arrived, and I said ?Nic, can you put out some of my stuff?? and he never did. I always ask him and he never will, and I like that! I hope I never have anything on R.I.P. Society: I mean, I love the label but I just like the idea of being good friends with him and never having anything on it.</p>

<p><strong>You had Kiosk support your Sydney album launch. What was that experience like?</strong><br/>
That was amazing! When I first moved here, the first band I ever saw was Circle Pit at The Hopetoun, and that&#8217;s how I met everyone. So it was great for them to join the bill. I think that they pulled a huge crowd; I guess it shows how relevant they were. It all came about pretty weirdly because we were all really drunk at Angie <a href="http://www.facebook.com/catcallmusic">Bermuda]?s birthday dinner in Newtown, and Catherine [Kelleher] just said, ?Kiosk should reform for the Camperdown launch!? So she put it on the Catcall [Facebook page</a> and that was that.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m not sure how long Camperdown will last; it might just be a one-album thing.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the story with <a href="/releases/2000362">Marf Loth</a>? Has that wrapped up now?</strong><br/>
Yeah it&#8217;s finished now. Marf Loth started out in Townsville as an experimental free-jazz band, because I was really obsessed with Frank Zappa and Ornette Coleman. Then I started doing some stuff with friends in high school and we made a few albums up there, and then I moved to Sydney and made four or five albums with various people like Owen [Penglis] from Straight Arrows and Daniel [Grosz] from Dead Farmers.  </p>

<p><strong>So are you focusing on Camperdown &amp; Out now or do you have some other projects going as well?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not sure how long Camperdown will last; it might just be a one-album thing. It&#8217;s tough because the other three guys are so busy with their real jobs and their other bands, but I&#8217;m not busy at all. I want to say yes to everything and play everywhere, but I&#8217;ve always thought that it doesn&#8217;t matter who you play with.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other things I&#8217;ve got going on; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/wentworthavenuebreezeout">Nathan Roche &amp; The Wentworth Avenue Breeze Out</a>, which is a garage-punk thing. <a href="/articles/4539572">Home Run</a> is my baseball-noise band with this guy Jay. I play in a punk band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-revisionists">The Revisionists</a> with some of the guys from King Tears <a href="http://disgustingpeople.bandcamp.com">Mortuary] and Beef Jerk. And [Disgusting People</a> as well, with Matt Banham and Craig Lyons and this guy Pat [Delohery]. But everything is pretty easy: it&#8217;s all like two chords.</p>
<p><strong>Is <a href="http://soundcloud.com/redneck-discoteque">Redneck Discotheque</a> still going as well?</strong><br/>
Oh yeah! That&#8217;s with my good friend Jordan Ireland from Townsville, who used to play in The Middle East. It&#8217;s pretty much whenever he&#8217;s in Sydney or I&#8217;m in Melbourne and we&#8217;re bored and drunk we&#8217;ll write a song, but we&#8217;ll never play I don&#8217;t think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still writing books too; I love doing that. I really only make music to be social and have fun; I think of myself more as a writer and a bartender. A while back I was supposed to have this writing residency in Spain funded by a government grant, but that fell through at the last minute so I ended up on a trip through Mexico. If I&#8217;ve still got ideas to write music and books, then that&#8217;s success to me. Or maybe success is being able to drink yourself to death off APRA royalty cheques in Barcelona.</p>
