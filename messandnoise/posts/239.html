                <h3>In part two of his interview with The Holy Rose&#8217;s Gareth Edwards, <strong>REN? SCHAEFER</strong> talks to the former Sandro frontman about life in the burbs, domesticity and striking the right balance between the personal and the universal.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3004190/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="587"/><br/>
<strong>Looking back at Sandro now, how do you feel about having created this rather substantial body of work? What are the highlights and lowlights?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m proud of what we did. The highlight for me was getting to meet lots of great people and having fun playing music with my friends. The US tour was great because it was such a new experience. It was fun to explore a different place. Certain gigs are memorable, the final one in particular. The first gigs were exciting and very tense due to the sparse nature of what we were doing and the setting in which it was being done. It felt, at that time, that we were bringing something a little bit different to the scene.</p>
<p>I think the realisation that things were finally drawing to a close for the band was the major lowlight. But nothing lasts forever and the end of one thing is always the start of something else. </p>
<p><strong>As much as Sandro seemed to be specific to you living in Melbourne and Sydney, The Holy Rose appears to be informed a lot by living in Brisbane with your family. Does place have a big influence on the songs you write?</strong><br/>
I tend to feel embedded in the places where I live. I think this feeling comes from many years of skateboarding. I tend to end up exploring all corners of the neighborhood so thoroughly that I start to feel absorbed into the environment, rather than something separate moving within it. From this position it&#8217;s very easy to see the commonalities between people&#8217;s experiences. I don&#8217;t feel distinct and special. </p>
<p><strong>The Holy Rose is very much your solo project. Why did you decide to do everything yourself, including recording and releasing your records?</strong><br/>
There are a few reasons. The first is practical. We had a baby and I needed to spend a lot more time at home with my family. I still wanted to play music, but without the time investment required for rehearsals, gigs and all of the organisational activities that go along with those things. So, I bought a little 8-track and set up a small studio at home. I wrote and recorded in the garage during my daughter&#8217;s nap times and at night. Secondly, after the break up of Sandro I lost a fair bit of confidence in my own abilities and I suppose I wanted to prove to myself that I could still write something I was happy with. I grew to enjoy the process of working alone and picked up a few new skills along the way.</p>
<p><strong>The solo guitar and extremely sparse sound of the Holy Rose recordings suits the intimate nature of the lyrics and the sound of your voice. Is it hard to translate that into live performances?</strong><br/>
Yes, but only because I tend to play in pubs, and people are drawn to socialise in that setting. I realised very early on that trying to play over people&#8217;s conversations, or trying to pull their attention with banter, was a bit pointless. If people want to listen, they will. If they don&#8217;t, well I just play the songs anyway and focus on the sounds I&#8217;m making. Now and then I get a gig where it seems like the whole room is paying attention. Those shows are very easy to play.</p>
<p><strong>You have deliberately removed yourself from the machinations of the music industry and even the indie scene, yet you continue to write, record and release CDs. Why?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m primarily interested in writing the songs and making the recordings. I enjoy the process of creating something and for me that&#8217;s almost enough. The internet has given me a convenient outlet for distributing the music. If I get the occasional email from someone telling me that they like something I&#8217;ve done, or if someone bothers to introduce themselves and tell me they enjoyed a gig I&#8217;ve played, then I&#8217;m satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Is the idea of being a bit of an outsider, an observer, appealing to you?</strong><br/>
I think it comes naturally to me, it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve engineered. I have other things that I do that keep me in touch with people, but I&#8217;m quite happy in my own company most of the time.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I&#8217;m married, with a daughter, a mortgage, a job and two cats. I couldn&#8217;t convincingly write songs about getting drunk and chasing women anymore &#8211; even if I wanted to.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>You write about a lot of domestic themes in your songs, often touching on very intimate subjects and everyday experiences that not a lot of song writers are willing to explore, yet you&#8217;re not a diarist. How do you strike a balance between the personal and the universal?</strong><br/>
The idea of accurately describing events doesn&#8217;t appeal to me. I would rather extract a few details from a scene and create a subtext for the listener to discover on their own. I know that when I listen to music I&#8217;m not really interested in the singer or musician&#8217;s intention. I think that leaving room for the listener&#8217;s own experience makes the song more useful to them. I suppose I also want to create some sense of drama without resorting to being overtly confessional.</p>
<p><strong>Your songs are very affectionate towards the suburbs and the people who live there. Where does this appreciation come from?</strong><br/>
I think that Australian suburbs are often miscategorised by urban dwellers as culturally bereft, bogan backwaters. On a very superficial level it&#8217;s obvious where this stereotype comes from. It is very easy to go to a suburban supermarket, for example, and view the families, teenagers and general subculture within it as being a dull hive for the lowest common denominator. The impression of sameness and apathy can seem overwhelming, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for. Because I have lived inside this world for a very long time I think I can appreciate the complexity that lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Also I think writing about the suburbs is appealing because not many people seem to be doing it, at least not in a sympathetic manner. Finally, I&#8217;m married, with a daughter, a mortgage, a job and two cats. I couldn&#8217;t convincingly write songs about getting drunk and chasing women anymore &#8211; even if I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>One of your funniest and most touching songs is ?Living Next Door To Stewart? from the <em>Land Of The Last</em> CD. Was Stewart, who ?calls his mum a fucking cunt?, a real person you grew up with?</strong><br/>
Yes. He was one of the kids who lived next door to us in Balcatta [WA]. He was a year younger than me and is solely responsible for introducing me to the harsher elements of the English language. His mother bred Persian cats. They gave us one, but it had epilepsy and used to piss all over the place whenever it had a fit. They also had chickens and two dogs called Blackie and Brownie. Blackie was black, Brownie was brown. For a short while we had a sandy-coloured Labrador called Sandy. If you ask a kid to name something you can be sure they&#8217;ll get it exactly right.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004191/440x309-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="309"/><br/>
<strong>A lot of your songs, like ?Firewood? off the latest Holy Rose album <em>Bats And Birds</em>, are very simple observations of everyday events and situations. Do you constantly see things you can turn into songs?</strong><br/>
In my free time I like to get out on my bike. It&#8217;s a dirt jump bike, so I get down to the jumps and the trails when I can. I&#8217;m not shit-hot, but I have fun. So, I spend a lot of time riding around between various destinations. In doing so I see a lot of what goes on in my neighbourhood. Certain things just seem to stick in my mind. Eventually a line for a song will pop into my head and, by that stage, I&#8217;ve got a pile of images and incidents to draw upon and connect. When it works, it all just seems to fall into place without much effort on my part. Sometimes the harder I look at something the stranger it becomes.</p>
<p><strong>On <em>Bats And Birds</em> you accompany your songs with other instruments, including keyboards and drums. Does that mean you might eventually return to playing with a band?</strong><br/>
I like playing with other people, but as a band leader I think I might still feel responsible in some way for providing some sort of path into the scene for the other members of the band, which is a feeling that conflicts with my nature. I guess what I&#8217;m saying is that I wouldn&#8217;t rule it out, but for the moment I&#8217;m happy to continue working alone.</p>
<p><strong>You are quite prolific. Have you got another record in the works yet?</strong><br/>
Yes. I am writing for it now and have got a couple of keepers. It might be a six or seven song EP. I&#8217;d like to do this one quickly. It might just be the nylon string and vocals. I&#8217;ve wanted to do that for a long time.</p>
