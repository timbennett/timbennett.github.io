                <h3>Melbourne punk quartet Clowns expand their sound on second album ?Bad Blood?, from vintage gear to more instrumental sections to an 11-minute finale. The band&#8217;s bassist, <strong>HERNY</strong>, unpacks every song, streaming exclusively below all week.

<h2>?Human Error?  </h2>
<p>Choosing an opening track for an album is always a bit of a tough decision. We all know that in this day and age a lot of listeners will flick on an album via some streaming service or an illegal torrent, and if it hasn&#8217;t captured them in the first 30 seconds they are likely to turn it off and say it sucks. Yet even realising this, we still decided to open the album with a track that has a long, dull intro with a scratchy, almost crappy-sounding guitar used with a pretty big compressor filter to give it that terrible ?are my speakers broken?? sound.</p>
<p>Eventually (for the listeners that make it through the intro) it does in fact jump in and grab you quite violently, with lots of sudden blasts with dissonant chords and what have you. We used a ?90s Goldtop Les Paul through a Sound City 120r head from the early ?70s to give it that vintage crunch on the guitar (a combination which was used very frequently on this record), and funnily enough we used the same amp with the bass on this one as well, played through a 1963 Fender Precision, to give it both that equally big and bouncy bass sound but level it out with that driving crunch you get through the Sound City 120r guitar amp.</p>
<p>Lyrically, it was inspired by a party we went to where one of our closest mates was the victim of some unfair police brutality. It took us five years to release a ?Fuck da police? song; I guess now we&#8217;re a real punk band?</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Never Enough?  </h2>
<p>We decided to follow up our fierce opening track with perhaps the poppiest (if you want to call it that) track on the whole album. On this album we&#8217;ve tried to expand a little on our old sound a fair bit, but I guess this particular track is the most reminiscent of our old sound. It&#8217;s kind of like a gateway track between the old and the new. It&#8217;s also probably the first song we&#8217;ve ever incorporated wah-wah pedals into, with both the bass and the guitar wah-ing it up in the intro.</p>
<p>The big instrumental bit in the middle was something that was worked on for a long time. The guitar was obviously brightened and boosted to make it really pop through and the bass gets a little splash of phaser on there too to make it really stand out as well, which is something we&#8217;ve never done before. This is one of the few tracks where we actually used a proper bass amp, opting for the ever reliable Orange Tiny Terror head and played via a vintage Russian Big Muff through the ?63 P bass, which gave it that really big, almost friendly-sounding bass tone. Most of the bass you will hear on this album is played through the various vintage guitar heads, totally Motorhead-style, that the studio had on offer.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Euthanise Me?  </h2>
<p>We all agreed this to be the first single of the album, as we for once all agreed that this would be a good one for the masses to enjoy. It&#8217;s pretty fast, it&#8217;s tough and it&#8217;s definitely punk, but I think we were pretty successful in keeping its vibe uplifting and disguising a bit of power-pop and melody in there as well to try and make a song that was uniquely ours. Lyrically, it&#8217;s inspired by conspiracy theories of the occult and Illuminati. It&#8217;s all one big vague metaphor, but if I gave away the meaning it would ruin the mystery, wouldn&#8217;t it? </p>
<p>I believe this was the first taste of the <a href="http://fuzzrociouspedals.com/">Fuzzrocious</a> ?Demon King? pedal (which I had custom-made specifically to be used on the album by a dude from New Jersey) used on the bass, which again was played via the trusty ?63 P bass, which we felt gave it that ?Radio Birdman on Meth? sorta vibe, which was quite important to achieve as this song has not one but two bass solos in it. Very ?77 punk.</p>
<p>We also combined that bass sound with the first taste of the <a href="http://www.crowtheraudio.net/products/hotcake">Crowther</a> ?Hot Cake? overdrive pedal (which are handmade in New Zealand by the guy from Split Enz) played through a 1974 Orange OR120 head. It sounded so mean that the Hot Cake pedal has now become a constant in Joe&#8217;s live set. </p>
<p>One final bit of a trivia about this song is the initial pick slide you hear in this song was done by the one and only Dave Larkin of Dallas Crane fame, who is definitely a master of the pick slide.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Figure It Out?  </h2>
<p>We chose this song to be the first taste people heard of the album, as we all agreed this song had everything people needed to hear from what the new album was going to be about, yet it was still short enough to not give too much away. I usually find that on a lot of albums, song #4 is when things start slow down, you start to get a few more feelings and it stays like that until song #8 or #9, when it gets bought back up again into a higher energy.</p>
<p>Nope, take a 10-second blast-beat/scream intro that after some ambiguity explodes into a hardcore punk track about failing at life that goes for no longer than a minute. This song was also where you first hear the Tym <a href="http://tymguitars.com.au/products/tym-red-mudd">Red Mudd</a> pedal which Tim from <a href="/articles/4682382">Tym&#8217;s Guitars Brisbane</a> kindly donated to us after I had my car broken into outside The Old Bar in Melbourne and had all my pedals stolen only a month or so out from stepping into the studio. The tones on this one sound bloody fat, cheers Tim.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Infected?  </h2>
<p>There are a few songs on this album which we thought very carefully about, took our time writing and, after a strenuous period of time, got to a point where we are all satisfied that it was done; this was not one of those songs. I&#8217;m pretty sure every Clowns release to date has at least one song which we have thrown together in attempt to meet a deadline, but in those cases it&#8217;s always funny how the songs which we spent less time on actually end up being some of the best songs on the record. We really pushed the guitar sound in the breakdown bit to be as fat and heavy as just a simple two-power-chord riff could get without it falling into the trap of being too fuzzy and lacking clarity. We&#8217;re stoked with how Jez [Jeremy Giddings] and Craig [Harnath], our producers, managed to achieve that. </p>
<p>When writing this one there was a blank spot at the end of this song which needed some vocals, which we were lucky enough to have our mate Karina Utomo from <a href="/releases/2001289">High Tension</a> come in and tear it up over the track. Ad fuckin? hell, does she nail it or what?</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Bad Blood?  </h2>
<p>We knew that on this album we wanted to play a lot more with music and sound, which would allow us to create more long instrumental sections for our songs. It&#8217;s something that we have never really done before, probably because we weren&#8217;t good enough to pull them off until now. I think we used about four or five separate guitar tracks within this one, all doing different things to give that ultra edge a slow instrumental song really requires, which in turn means that when we play this live it&#8217;s a completely differently structured song. Still good, but completely different to what you hear on the recording.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?These Veins?  </h2>
<p>From the outside, it&#8217;s just a straight-up punk rock tune with a bit of a surfy aspect to it. But we really made an effort on this one to try and give it a semi-serious vibe, while still maintaining a lot of the melody and powerful major chords that are the basis of most of our tracks. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m looking too far into it now though, but it definitely feels fresh for us to be playing stuff like this.</p>

<h2>?Swallow Your Dreams?  </h2>
<p>Mushrooms can be your friends, but they can also be your enemy: this theme is explored lyrically on this track. We all love bands like Poison Idea, Melvins and a whole bunch of ?80s death- and thrash-metal bands, and to a degree our music has always been influenced by that darker and heavier side of punk. </p>
<p>On this track we really tried to nail a heavier-sounding vibe, but without succumbing to the old trick of heavier being faster, and now I think about it, it&#8217;s probably one of the slowest songs we&#8217;ve ever written. The guitar work in particular on this one is pretty awesome, coming through the vintage Hiwatt Custom 100 head, especially Joe&#8217;s killer Jeff Hanneman-esque solo. He was so proud of it, he wouldn&#8217;t even allow a rhythm guitar track behind it and specifically asked for the bass to be turned down. We let him have his way, just this once.</p>

<h2>?It Stops With You?  </h2>
<p>After a slower start to Side B, this is the point of the record where things start getting very fast very suddenly. In it we try our best to disassociate ourselves with the racist views that plague much of our nation&#8217;s halfwits, with some pretty full-on lyrics that I&#8217;m sure if you showed your bogan cousins from the country at the Christmas table they&#8217;d probably choke on their lunch. We even included a Joe Hansen-esque ?fuck the world? rant, probably just because we&#8217;d been listening to too much Suicidal Tendencies and Night Fever&#8230;</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Is This a Test??  </h2>
<p>Just a fucken? fast song with some skitzy lyrics but with a bit more riffage in it this time. Must say the blasts coming out of Jake&#8217;s locally custom-made ?Gas? drum kit on this one are pretty phenomenal: some seriously epic shit coming off of those skins. The bass that was used on these couple of really quick ones is also a funny story. They were all used with a headless ?Dream Theatre nerd-looking bass,? and as daggy as it looked it was really the only thing that could handle clarity whilst being played at the speed we were playing at. And secretly, although we didn&#8217;t allow any photos to be taken of it, we all absolutely loved how it sounded.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great video of Craig, the studio&#8217;s owner, who also owns the whole amazing collection of gear at Hothouse, playing the headless bass we used on these very vicious and hate-filled hardcore songs live on <em>Countdown</em> with Molly Meldrum in the ?80s when he was playing in his New Wave/disco/pop band Kids in the Kitchen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=Q5lUJl2CPEQ">no shit</a>.</p>

<h2>?Derailed?  </h2>
<p>There&#8217;s really nothing much to say about this song that you can&#8217;t get within the 10 seconds or so it goes for. Just a one-line metaphor about how small things can have drastic consequences. This one also has one of the coolest post-tracking edits we did on the whole album, which was the ridiculously thunderous sounding effect Jez put on the final drum hits that let the song ring out into the oblivion with help from the famous Neve mixing desk at Hothouse. If you crank your speakers really loud, the drums sound like an earthquake erupting or an atomic bomb striking the ground: absolutely loud and ruthless.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Dead in the Suburbs?  </h2>
<p>This song we actually recorded a few months before the rest as a sort of trial day in the studio, though once we were there it didn&#8217;t really take much convincing for us to stay on and finish the whole thing in the same place. This is the only song on the album that features the 1976 Rickenbacker 4001 bass, which just goes to show how spoilt for choice we really were at Hothouse knowing they had a ?70s 4001 there and we only used it once. The bass was played through the ?70s Hiwatt head via a locally made ?basskadet? distortion pedal, which reallllly gave it that Motorhead-sounding crunch. The Les Paul Joe used on this one also sounds bloody mean. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely the fastest song on the album that doesn&#8217;t have any blast beats in. Its lyrical content is just a very straightforward story about living in an area you just can&#8217;t relate to for various reasons: a running theme that a lot of the album references, including the title and the album artwork. Oh, and that initial scream at the start of the song was done in one take through the pickups of a guitar instead of a vocal mic. Gnarly.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Play Dead?  </h2>
<p>I guess this one is kind of like Straightjacket Nation meets Electric Wizard vibe, or maybe others might think completely different. Who knows? But one thing is for sure and that&#8217;s that it was definitely one of the most fun songs to record.</p>
<p>The guitars you&#8217;re hearing are the Goldtop Les Paul, a hollow-body 1972 Gibson 335 (yep, seriously) and the ?63 Fender P again. But to top off, in the doom section we added a ?63 Fender IV, which, for those who don&#8217;t know, is a six-string guitar with a jag body but instead of six-guitar strings it has six bass strings on it, and it sounds HUGE. If you listen closely you can also hear us going to town on the whammy bar with it, making it sound like Satan gargling up his Listerine. Absolutely crushing. </p>
<p>The noise part to follow is where things got a little crazy: you can hear five bass tracks, one being a straight-up one-note ringing out where we used five different distortion and fuzz pedals in a chain to gather up enough sustain to ring out for the whole section, plus four other tracks going nuts on the multi-FX unit. On the guitar we did 10 separate noise tracks mashing buttons and twisting knobs on all sorts of different pedals, which sent Jez into a near psychotic state mixing it all, although it&#8217;s safe to say he totally nailed it.</p>

<h2>?Human Terror?  </h2>
<p>We could dissect this one up and analyse it until the cows come home but all you really need to know is that it was an absolute journey to write, an absolute journey to record and we really that hope it&#8217;s an absolute journey to listen too, all 11 something minutes of it. We thought it was a fitting way to close the album.</p>
