<h2>August 18</h2>
<p>We join The Bedroom Philosopher&#8217;s tour in Canberra, having skipped the Tasmanian and South Australian legs. James and I fly in from Melbourne an hour before Charles and Tony, who are flying in from Brisbane. Being a band spread across two states has surprisingly few downsides and it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure to be reunited again. The fact that we just finished our own album tour also means we can forego the usual anti-cobwebs rehearsal and head straight to the first show. We walk out into the cold drizzle, pick up the hire car and the tour begins.</p>
<p>As always this trip is accompanied by the constant rhythm of gentle bickering over mundane tasks such as packing the car, directions and parking, not unlike a family holiday. We scan through radio stations before settling on ABC 666AM, the aunty of the beast. We drive past a library bigger than the Whitehouse.</p>
<p>At this point you can see where I&#8217;m heading. Experience follows experience, impression follows impression but this is only part of what I need to relate. The more times you go on tour, the more you find that the place you are in is actually your own thoughts and memories &#8211; of either the place you are in or the place you think of as home. </p>
<p>This is especially true when you are waiting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well-established that waiting takes up a huge proportion of the time one spends on tour. Waiting in the airport, on the plane, for your luggage, in the hire car, waiting to soundcheck, waiting to play, waiting to go home or go out. Waiting on tour is different to normal waiting. I find the more I tour, the more the nature of waiting changes. When you wait 15 minutes it&#8217;s actually the feeling of having waited for the equivalent of all the accumulated amounts of time you have ever had to wait on tour plus 15 minutes. Of course you can say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not waiting! I&#8217;m reading. I&#8217;m drinking. I&#8217;m playing <em>WarioWare</em>.&#8221; But really you are waiting.</p>
<p>The only exception is playing and talking to old and new friends &#8211; I will not actually be discussing these two exceptions much, even though they make up a large part of the trip. As with songwriting, often the things that make us happy are not the ones we examine closely or try to understand more. Just know that for the last seven years playing music and being with friends is almost exclusively what has made touring completely worthwhile and deeply enjoyable.</p>
<p>Repetition can feel like a kind of waiting and also gets you down so anything that&#8217;s even slightly different from previous tours is exciting &#8211; for example our first show at ANU Bar in Canberra. It at first seems that it will be hard to entice people away from their beer benches and we hatch a plot to offer a free jug to the first table to dance. Happily our planned offer is pre-empted by half the crowd who come down the front and make it feel like a show.</p>
<h2>August 19</h2>
<p>The next morning we wake up from the first of two nights of hotel accommodation we will experience on this tour and drive to Wollongong. Generally we stay on people&#8217;s floors and couches and most of the time I prefer it that way: it&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve met and kept in touch with many dear friends. When you live in the same city as someone you know you can put off catching up, but when you are on the road, camped out on their lounge room floor with only two days up your sleeve, time together just happens.</p>
<p>August 19 is the day we play Wollongong. It&#8217;s also the day that my divorce hearing is scheduled. My wife and I separated a year-and-a-half ago and more recently she did the paper work via an ?eVorce? form you can fill out online. There&#8217;s still always an actual court date though, with attendance optional for either party &#8211; to give things the proper gravity, I suppose. Of course, I&#8217;m in Wollongong and she didn&#8217;t attend either so I guess it was just the judge.</p>
<p>The others hit the beach while I stay in the room above the pub and watch Steven Seagal&#8217;s <em>Hard Target*. Last time we were in town it was *Robocop</em>. The Wollongong show goes well, although we and the Beddy Philly cop a lot of back talk from a single gent who swings wildly between threats and support. There is a beautiful fishtank at the back behind the bar and I spend a good portion of the night following the movements of a fish whose body is shaped like a staffie&#8217;s head (front-mounted eyes, velvety matte grey skin, no visible scales). An aboriginal dude, who turns out to be the night&#8217;s heckler, gives Charles a hard time at the merch desk over our band name while using his only arm to jab him in the chest repeatedly with our album, before eventually buying a copy. &#8220;Boat people?! Boat people!! Yeah! Boat people! You&#8217;re the boat people mate! Hur hur hur!&#8221;</p>
<h2>August 20</h2>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3015100/266x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We drive to Sydney and spend the afternoon in Victoria Park waiting for soundcheck. I buy several boxes of old matches with the names of exotic old-world hotels on them and an Adam Ant 7? &#8211; both as presents &#8211; as well as a book and a Vietnamese roll. The Factory show is a lot of fun and Charles participates in the first Bedroom Philosopher human pyramid of the tour. Afterwards we head to my first Purple Sneakers where the Beddy Philly band are guest DJs. Then it&#8217;s off to bed in a triple-decker inhabited by some Deep Sea Arcades and a Dappled. We have the eerie experience of arriving there and leaving the next morning without seeing any of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that touring in a band was a factor in my marriage ending. Since I moved to Melbourne four years ago, before that even, I estimate I would&#8217;ve spent about three months of every year away from home. I came back from tour three days before our wedding. I was on tour on our first anniversary. </p>
<p>We also had six months apart when she moved to Melbourne. She was the reason I moved down. It&#8217;s not the long periods that get you though, it&#8217;s the short ones and what constantly adjusting back and forth does to your life at home. Life got into a cycle where I&#8217;d go away and come back poor, exhausted, not wanting to go out or see people. You can&#8217;t travel with the person you love because you use up all your free time on touring. It&#8217;s always worse for the person left in the empty house too. I&#8217;ve been in the situation once or twice so I can make the comparison. Why am I telling you all this? Because these thoughts are also experiences I had on tour.</p>
<h2>August 21</h2>
<p>Saturday! Today Australia decides! We attempt unsuccessfully to vote in the suburb we woke up in, running into Malcolm Turnbull along the way. &#8220;Good on you for exercising your democratic right boys!&#8221; he says not knowing we have been unsuccessful. After a detour to the city to get our votes in, we head to Newcastle. A TV in a corner above the stage shows the election count and every now and then I peak around my keyboard to get an update. The Seabellies are our gracious hosts and eloquent conversationalists on this evening.</p>
<h2>August 22</h2>
<p>We round out the NSW leg of the tour at the Brass Monkey in Cronulla, a lovely venue, whose crew have always treated us well. I&#8217;ve been reading a book that references highballs without defining them, and I decide they will be my drinking homework for the tour. When I request a highball at the bar, I am told there is no such thing. (I will later be told otherwise when back in Melbourne though it is still contentious.) Instead I am given a Tom Collins and a little nip of a particularly sweet gin that is used specifically for making them, followed by a Moscow Mule.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Regional shows for some reason force you to fight for the audience more, to make everything bolder, make sure you&#8217;re heard. It explains a lot about the sound of Australian pub rock.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Beddy Philly&#8217;s show makes me laugh night after night. His brand of humour is drawn from seemingly compulsive, highly detailed observation of his immediate environment, incorporating it into a highly personal mythological landscape that&#8217;s under constant construction. This quality is ever present and reminds me of the monstrously perceptive descriptions of family life in Jonathan Franzen&#8217;s <em>The Corrections</em>. It&#8217;s interesting to see how his show bristles and bucks in the regional areas. Having grown up in a country town, I feel particularly aware of it. Regional shows for some reason force you to fight for the audience more, to make everything bolder, make sure you&#8217;re heard. It explains a lot about the sound of Australian pub rock. Our band tends to respond the same way as the Bedroom Philosopher does and it&#8217;s hard to adjust back to the more gentle ?take it or leave it? approach that somewhere like Melbourne responds to more warmly and which is frankly closer to my own attitude.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what category Cronulla falls into. For the first and only time on the tour, Justin interrupts his own set to play a ?quasi serious? song, the subject matter of which is so direct and personal that I hesitate to relate it here due to the lingering effect of feeling &#8211; probably along with the rest of the audience &#8211; that I have been confided in. A girl nearby me is openly sobbing by its summary. Suffice to say there was no ?quasi? involved.</p>
<p>After the show, one of the punters asks us for a ride back to Sydney and we&#8217;re happy to oblige. Turns out he&#8217;s been counting votes the past two days. He says that you can write/draw almost anything you want on a ballot paper, and that as long as you&#8217;ve actually numbered your box(es) and your unsolicited decorations don&#8217;t intersect with any of those boxes, then your vote will still be counted. You can&#8217;t write your name though. Popular choices reportedly included drawing dicks, writing ?fuck you? and drawing an extra box marked ?Kevin Rudd? with a number in it. Apparently even this last option won&#8217;t ruin your vote depending on how you&#8217;ve filled in everything else, although it is at the discretion of a supervisor.</p>
<h2>August 23-26</h2>
<p>I catch the red eye to Melbourne and get home in time to spend some time with a friend working on his album, which I&#8217;ve been producing bit by bit over the year. Tuesday is the day job &#8211; office temping, currently with precarious emphasis on the ?temp? part &#8211; followed by a Machine Translations rehearsal. On Thursday, James and I will fly to Brisbane to play in Machine Translations.</p>
<h2>August 27</h2>
<p>Friday, I wash an enormous bag of clothes I brought with me, knowing that it would be my only chance to wash them and that here in Brisbane, unlike in Melbourne, they&#8217;ll actually dry on the line.</p>
<p>Around this time, someone posts an article online bemoaning the death of the mysterious and iconic personas that artists were said to be able to cultivate before the age of blogging and connecting with fans directly. It was claimed that they ruined the mystery and iconic power of their stage personas via endless updates about their pets, for example. I guess that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re reading right now. My options seemingly limited to cloying mundanity or trying to prove my rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll archetype status by inserting my name into stories that ring familiar enough to interest people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t give a shit about me. </p>
<p>As a songwriter and performer you encounter the challenge of being the documenter and the spectacle in one &#8211; roles that you see a lot, both represented and lived, but often split into separate people. Once again, knowing that I would be writing a tour diary means my thoughts about writing are also experiences I have had on tour (thus falling at least partly into the category of spectacle as well). Writing is something that I have become more and more drawn to over time, not so much because of any specific advantage of effect within the medium, but because the process of production is still so simple.</p>
<h2>August 28</h2>
<p>Saturday, I take up a friend&#8217;s Friday night invitation to visit a shared studio space. I walk up and down several hills and past the governor general&#8217;s house, eating pear gelato and alternately cursing the Brisbane heat and my Melbourne attire on my way there. I arrive to find no one is around bar a large, menacing chicken who is also trying to get in and approaches me threateningly, clucking at me until I share my gelato, which she pecks at greedily at first, then disdainfully shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>Everyone appears baring lunch items and we shoot the shit over salad rolls. I sit in on a few jams then dash off to soundcheck at The Troubadour. The show is sold out and we engage in a respectable amount of party times afterwards. </p>
<h2>August 29</h2>
<p>Respectable because we have to get up on Sunday for an all-ages show at the Old Museum, which is the kind of beautifully incongruous, sub-tropical, ye olde public building that no other capital city in Australia can lay claim to.</p>

<p>All three bands burn through their sets so as to make it to Byron Bay in time for the evening gig. Byron has the honour of winning the ?crowd most preoccupied with talking to each other? award thanks to a few stand-out MVPs. A bunch of nice people dance during our set but one wonders whether some care more about the backbeat than the songs or the band.</p>
<p>Steve Grady opens the show with assistance from Dan Parsons. I interviewed Dan and Steve back when we were driving to Sydney &#8211; I&#8217;m writing a press release for them about a tour they will be doing together in coming months. It&#8217;s called ?50 First Dates? &#8211; 50 shows throughout regional Australia. I expressed incredulity over whether there was a point in a gruelling run through areas that may not have developed an appetite for new music but they remained undeterred. They wanted stories, to test themselves, to be ?On The Road? &#8211; to give their inner-documenter a big dose of Moriarty presumably.</p>
<p>?These guys are weapons,? says the Beddy Philly&#8217;s Hugh halfway through Grady&#8217;s show and he&#8217;s right, they are. Grady however loses his cool halfway through the last song, perhaps letting the crowd chatter get the better of him, and walks off stage. This makes me wonder why he and Dan want to subject themselves to 50 first dates, but then again maybe that&#8217;s the explanation. James dubs Steve, ?Brainsnap Grady?, but he disappears off to bed before the name gets much use. We finish the QLD leg of the tour with a little porch party upstairs. It&#8217;s a big part of what makes The Great Northern one of my favourite places to play.</p>
<h2>August 30-September 3</h2>
<p>Back in Melbourne, and with most of the bands and their members hailing from said city, the feeling of being home incites more docile behaviour and we negotiate the Geelong, Ballarat, and Hepburn springs shows evenly, pacing ourselves for the homecoming shows at the Northcote Social Club and the end of the tour, driving home each night and sleeping each day. Five members of the already-modest crowd at the Ballarat show are thrown out, which in percentage terms is a new tour record.</p>
<h2>September 4-5</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3015099/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Two nights at the Northcote Social Club. It&#8217;s fitting that Justin is launching his new-ish album <em>Songs from the 86 Tram</em> in a venue situated on that line.</p>
<p>The Saturday is sold out, sometimes in a scary way. One particularly extroverted ice fan asks me if I would ?like a head-butt in the face?&#8221; Pinky Beecroft has been the third act on the bill for most of the tour and pulls out a cracker tonight. He is a shambolic and charismatic vagabond and barely-reformed dandy in the classic tradition who nonetheless provokes a subtle gravitas upon arrival. We hypothosise that he and David McCormack would get along very well &#8211; and later find that this supposition has already been proven. Fingers crossed for a supergroup.</p>
<p>The Sunday show is packed full by just the right amount. Someone down the front requests &#8216;Hidden Busses&#8217; from <em>Dear Darkly</em>, and while I appreciate she likes the song (I like it too), we will never ever play it live. Sorry about that. A bunch of Bedroom Philosopher percussion-istas join us onstage to kick out the jams at the end of the show. They&#8217;ve been the best of touring companions, and I wish I had the wherewithal to shower each one with epithets at this late point in the text.</p>
<p>Finally, in what has become something of an end-of-tour tradition for us, we invite everyone back to our Brunswick Boat Bungalow. I dance to <em>Grammy Rap Nominees 1998</em>. My sister gives me a scotch decanter that comes in a serving unit featuring a built-in music box and ice bucket. We drink a drank that was taught to me by a man called Cookie in a place called Toowoomba. We all feel love for each other and have a good time.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>The Boat People will play shows in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in November. Stay tuned for details.</p>
