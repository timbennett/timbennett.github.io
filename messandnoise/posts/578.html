                <h3>Guineafowl&#8217;s Sam Yeldham considers music a stabilising force. He talks to <strong>CAITLIN WELSH</strong> about raucous gigs, rock star antics and what it&#8217;s like to be covered by his peers. 
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3018405/448x298-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
First, some trivia. Sam Yeldham shares a birthday (January 8) with Elvis Presley, David Bowie, Dame Shirley Bassey, R Kelly, and my boyfriend Hugh. On his 23rd birthday, last year, Sam was playing his third gig as Guineafowl; backed with a live band of school and uni friends, they were one of about nine acts on the bill at MUM, an unruly weekly night at the World Bar in King&#8217;s Cross. I went along with Hugh and yet another birthday boy to join the fray. We fought our way up the poky staircase, clutching $9 worth of beer in each hand. In the upstairs band room, an act whose name I failed to retain was doing some seriously rough justice to ?Boris the Spider?, much of it from the floor. It was a sweat lodge with amps and chandeliers. The sofas at the back wall were supporting a dozen people each by the time Guineafowl took the floor, inches from the semicircle of teapot-wielding punters closing around them.</p>
<p>The World Bar, famously, used to be a brothel; one would think that the floors have taken their share of thumping, raucous, rhythmic damage. But by the end of their half-hour set &#8211; they only had half a dozen songs, at the most &#8211; the old building was complaining. I don&#8217;t know how many kids were in that room but it was too many. They were even packed three deep on the slender strip of balcony outside the French doors, and they all seemed to know the words.</p>
<p>?Yeah, we got told by management that they thought the floor was going to come down,? says Sam. We&#8217;re sitting upstairs at a caf? on Glebe Point Road the day after Australia Day. It&#8217;s hot, and there&#8217;s a loud clump of teenagers carb-loading for the Big Day Out at the next table. ?That was a pretty insane gig. And that was with very minimal exposure, so I don&#8217;t know how that happened. If I knew how that happened?? He trails off and shakes his head slightly as if to clear it. ?So yeah, that was a year ago.?</p>
<p>Starting with that first World Bar gig, Guineafowl played 59 shows last year. They were signed to Dew Process by the end of winter, and their debut EP <em><a href="/releases/2000829">Hello Anxiety</a></em> came out last week.</p>
<p><strong>Did you think you&#8217;d get signed this early?</strong><br/>
No. It was a goal, though. Kip [Williams, Sam&#8217;s school friend, erstwhile keyboardist and director of their breakout clip for ?Botanist?] set me the goal. He said, ?You should be signed by the end of 2010.? So I basically only did it for him. [<em>Chuckles</em>] I didn&#8217;t feel like we deserved to be signed yet, didn&#8217;t feel like we&#8217;d been around long enough. To me, that opportunity, when it was put in front of me &#8211; to go and make more music is something that I can&#8217;t really turn down. And I needed it mentally, to stabilise the fact that this is what I was gonna do. And you know me, I&#8217;ve been doing random things since I was at school, ranged through a lot of different things, performance sort of things &#8211; I needed something to stabilise it in my head and it certainly wasn&#8217;t going to be money.</p>
<p><strong>You need a reason to put it on your immigration forms, on your census forms. Official-like.</strong><br/>
That, or Jedi. It was going to be either musician or Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>Well, why not just put it down? It&#8217;s not like you need any kind of proof anyway.</strong><br/>
Well, you do. [<em>Matter-of-factly</em>] You need a lightsaber. You have to make a lightsaber.</p>
<p><strong>Or a beard. Or a rat-tail.</strong><br/>
Maybe a beard.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t get a rat-tail.</strong><br/>
I wouldn&#8217;t get a rat-tail.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>When I met Sam, in a first-year English tutorial, he was wearing a CanTeen bandanna around his too-long hair like he thought he was on <em>21 Jump Street</em> or some shit. He was cocky, but appealingly so, and clearly smarter than just about everyone in the room. The ?performance sort of things? he did throughout uni were mostly Theatresports and acting &#8211; he was Laertes once, playing it intense with a hair-trigger temper, and one night he fought so hard over Ophelia&#8217;s grave that Hamlet left the stage with Sam&#8217;s blood on his face. He was in a band for a while, along with Williams and current Guineafowl guitarist Doug Thompson. They made it through a few rounds of the same USyd Band Comp that boasted Cloud Control and Richard In Your Mind among the winners that year. He hosted Manning Bar&#8217;s weekly trivia with an iron wit and a zero-tolerance approach to mobile phone use, which is the way it should be.</p>
<p>The ?Botanist? clip, a quietly surreal lo-fi affair done in a single long take, made it into rage&#8217;s Top 50 videos at the end of 2009. It was made before any gigs had happened, only a couple of months after Sam had started recording songs at home on his laptop &#8211; looping spindly guitar motifs over handclaps and eerie stretches of sound and turning them into claustrophobic little pop songs. His voice has a strange quality to it, at once arch and warm, authoritative and wistful. That bedroom aesthetic has largely disappeared into the expansive shimmer that characterises their sound now. The live shows are an gleeful, upbeat affair, almost uniformly sweaty and packed, and their signature move is to finish with a cover of a pop song so classic it&#8217;s almost daggy karaoke, anything from Springsteen to the Cure to the Hilltop Hoods. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>I had a writing teacher who used to tell us to copy out short stories. Just so we&#8217;d know what it was like to write them.</strong><br/>
You look at so many of the great bands &#8211; the Stones, the Beatles, or, I don&#8217;t know many modern examples of it, I only know classic ones, they were all cover bands. And I think covers are important. And when you&#8217;re a new band &#8211; first you get everyone&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p><strong>You sure did that. I remember that show at the Vanguard, when you did?</strong><br/>
[The Cure&#8217;s] ?Close to Me?. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>That was mental &#8230; It was this surge towards the stage. It gets the energy up. And the good thing about the way you guys do it is that it doesn&#8217;t come off as stealing someone else&#8217;s magic for your own benefit &#8211; you love playing the songs.</strong><br/>
Yeah. Every good show we&#8217;ve ever done &#8211; this is going to sound incredibly wanky, but it&#8217;s a giving thing. If you&#8217;re not onstage and being quite vulnerable, if you&#8217;re not showing the audience that you need them &#8211; And every show I&#8217;ve ever played where I&#8217;ve been kind of pissed off, the audience is standing the dreaded five feet away, and I can&#8217;t be fucked bringing them forward, is a bad show. Because there&#8217;s no dialogue between me and the audience &#8211; I don&#8217;t put myself on the line, so why should they?</p>
<p>A three-week residency at Oxford Art Factory last year saw them pack out the Gallery Bar over three free Friday night shows. The first was warmly received, with a burst of manic energy at the end as the band broke out a faithful, fervent ?Dancing In The Dark?. I missed the second week, but the last was a total clusterfuck. People were crowding in as it was, and while the paying customers were waiting for Black Cab to come onstage, in the other room they wandered over the see what all the fuss was about. I wedged myself in &#8211; d&#8217;j? vu, I thought &#8211; and listened to people around me yelling at their friends, asking who the hell these guys were.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first show ever as Guineafowl?</strong><br/>
Um, Cuthbert and the Nightwalkers. Their album launch.</p>
<p><strong>How was that?</strong><br/>
Really good. I mean, it was our first show, so we were so nervous, and there were a lot of people there to see us &#8211; a lot of friends, a lot of family, curious about what we were doing. That was at the end of December 2009, the 29th or something. And I remember we behaved like absolute rockstars that night. Like, got belted right afterwards, upstairs at the Annandale.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s so louche and impressive the first time you go up there; like it&#8217;s the Chelsea or something.</strong><br/>
Yeah, exactly. Like, Tim Rogers definitely puked somewhere in here. Probably right there, and there. And there, and there. And we felt like we couldn&#8217;t do better than that. We were at the Annandale, and it was a really great show, supporting a really good band, and so that was number one.</p>
<p/><center>???</center>
<p>The latest triumph is a Sydney Music, Arts and Culture Award. Run by FBi radio, they were handed out a week before our interview, with the Best Sydney Song category going to Guineafowl&#8217;s breakout single ?In Our Circles?. Sam uses the word ?honoured? four times in two sentences when I ask him about it, but the thing that really floored him was hearing it covered by a ?Sydney supergroup? that included members of Cloud Control, Straight Arrows, Bridezilla, ky? and megastick fanfare.</p>
<p>?When I got to the SMAC awards early, the bands were soundchecking, and the supergroup jumped up to soundcheck. I heard the first couple of chords, I heard <em>that</em> chord, and I was like, I know that sound &#8211; too well! &#8211; and the melody just sort of floated above that. I just bolted to side of stage to listen. [It was] amazing. Alyx [Dennison] from ky? just sang it so beautifully &#8211; It&#8217;s pretty insane to hear a song of yours covered. I know bands get used to it, but I&#8217;m not.?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s tempting to credit the gradual sonic shift from intimate to anthemic to the strange alchemy of ?In Our Circles?. In demo form, even with everything multi-tracked and reverbed to shit, you can feel it straining at the edges of its technical limitations. Live, and on the Scott Horscroft-produced EP released last week, it opens out beautifully. It&#8217;s like the difference between your backyard and, say, the Lorne Amphitheatre. Made for a mid-afternoon festival crowd, just as everything begins to bleed into everything else, pill haze and beer haze and sunset haze, there&#8217;s a soothing, uplifting, almost meaningless refrain that the stoned and the heartbroken alike can echo: ?Let me in, let me down/Let me in, let me down.?</p>
<p>Then the guitars stomp satisfyingly on that moment with a finely balanced cocktail of that <em>Joshua Tree</em>-shimmer and a subtly grungy fuzz. It&#8217;s the same deep, blazing effect that give Cloud Control&#8217;s happy-clappy sound an edge, but here it&#8217;s used to anchor a slightly darker, slinkier aesthetic. That song&#8217;s gossamer melody, abstracted lyrics and easily-learned call-and-response structure give it a nursery rhyme-like feel, but the subsumed menace in the lyrics &#8211; when you sit down and listen hard &#8211; feels like a declaration of war: ?We form in our circles/And condemn you if you break our circles/Never let you leave, not with all your teeth/Kids can dance dance dance dance dance dance dance.?</p>
<p>My personal favourite, the recently revamped ?Little Fingers?, emerges within the same theme: kids versus adults, fun and chaos and exuberance as an act of rebellion (?We can drive a car without keys or experience) or maybe wry rage at the selfish abuses of previous generations (?Push a few buttons, drown another hundred?). The best part is, those gleefully threatening affirmations are delivered in a sunny, forceful, catchy-as-fuck package with a cheeky guitar solo thrown in for good measure. But like most good pop, remember, it&#8217;s darker underneath.</p>

For a long time the standard press photo for Guineafowl has been a photo of Sam: head and shoulders, in his customary plain white t-shirt, with a smeared mask of blue, green, yellow and pink facepaint. It&#8217;s a playful palette, but his face is hard &#8211; his mouth set, dark brown eyes burning holes in something in the middle distance. A mutual friend took the photo at uni near the beginning of last year.</p>
<p>?It was one of the worst days of my life, too,? he says wryly, when I mention the picture. ?One of the worst days/weeks of my life. We took that photo, and did that Major Label thing [a single release of ?In Our Circles? through General Pants Co.?s label], but my personal life was like, ?Oh, boy.? That was what most of my year was like. Just my personal life being destroyed &#8211; But look, I think that&#8217;s going to inform the next lot of music I write. But last year for me was just music &#8211; and being so busy [kept] me from going insane.?</p>
<p><strong>Did you do a lot of writing then?</strong><br/>
No. Couldn&#8217;t. Every time I did I&#8217;d get too upset. About the subject matter, about what I was writing &#8211; it was too soon. You can&#8217;t paint a forest if you&#8217;re right in the middle of it, you can only see a couple of trees around you &#8211; you need to be above it, to get a good picture of that wilderness that you&#8217;re in. I was too deep. Couldn&#8217;t see anything. It was pretty fucked up. My music&#8217;s pretty upbeat, so playing all these upbeat songs whilst being incredibly, incredibly down about my personal life &#8211; It was kind of a nice contrast, really. Quite interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Well I think that&#8217;s a useful thing &#8211; Brian Wilson swore by that, writing happy songs about incredibly sad things.</strong><br/>
Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s quintessential in pop; it&#8217;s usually sad subject matter, but told in a really upbeat and uplifting way. That&#8217;s something that I think we do, and that I wanna keep doing. I think that makes it pop, but it also makes it engaging and sometimes quite meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a cathartic thing.</strong><br/>
Yeah, and it should be. Music should be.</p>
