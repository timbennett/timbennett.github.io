                <h3>Songs inspired by Samuel Fuller films, Greta Garbo and daytime soaps &#8211; the always entertaining <strong>SIR</strong> (aka Jesse Jackson Shepherd) leads us through &#8216;Tears Again&#8217;, his new collaborative album with actor Jane Badler.
</h3>

<h2>?Sometimes I Fall In Love With The Wrong People?</h2>
<p>With this album and particularly this song, I was trying to recreate all the thoughts that came into my mind when I used to watch daytime TV all day, every day, stressing about what was going to become of my life and waiting for <em>Family Ties</em> to start.   </p>
<p>Paying homage to the ?80s daytime soap, Paul Grabowsky (producer) created an opening similar to that of the Emmys or possibly the Logies. I really think his production nailed that daytime TV vibe. At the time, I was listening to Miles Davis? ?On the Street? a lot and remarked to Paul how much I loved wah-wah trumpet. When I heard it I must say it was very ?On The Street?, and that street was named ?Ramsay?.</p>
<h2>?Men Who Lie?</h2>
<p>An old song that was always fun to play with Jane and then I realised, to my horror, no one who came to see Jane had ever heard the old version. The song fits Jane like a glove and features some cool percussion from a guy called Javier that Paul brought in. As a side note, I&#8217;m a teacher by day and my students found the SIR version on YouTube. They sing or scream it to me every time I&#8217;m on yard duty, so literally it has become legendary in my own lunchtime.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?4 Corners To My Bed?</h2>
<p>The title of this song was taken from a Samuel Fuller film <em>The Naked Kiss*, and always made people laugh when I used it in everyday parlance. The first line was taken from the Jean Genet play, *The Maids</em>. Paul&#8217;s playing and production took it somewhere sleazier than even I imagined. </p>
<h2>?I Want A Lot Of Boys To Cry At My Funeral?</h2>
<p>I used to sing this to myself all the time (well change the ?boys? to ?girls?) just prior to recording as I realised most of my friends at that time were women, and it would have been a pretty glamorous pew. Then Jane and I were discussing actors she knew and how they become fascinated by their own story and would regularly become obsessed by their final act. </p>
<h2>?I Don&#8217;t Trust Women?</h2>
<p>So anyway, one day I&#8217;m discussing a personal matter with a friend of mine and she says, ?I don&#8217;t trust women.? I was pretty shocked for two main reasons: one was how she seemed to group all of womankind into a bucket in such a simplistic way; and secondly I thought, ?That is one hell of a jaded VCE student.?</p>
<h2>?Did I Leave The House Today??</h2>
<p>I was living with Jessica Venables aka Jessica Says and one day I was running around the house trying to find my keys in a panic. I started trying to retrace my steps and it was proving more difficult than I imagined it ever could be. Anyway, I&#8217;m asking myself, ?Did I leave the house today??, and Jess stops me and says that sounds like a title to a Jane song. The line in the bridge section, ?When memories are more important than dreams?, is inspired by a promo of the great Canadian wrestler Brett ?The Hitman? Hart.</p>
<h2>?Snow Carnival Queen?</h2>
<p>Jane and I were going through her colourful history one day and she advised me she was once a Snow Carnival Queen as a young woman. I thought that could be a cool title for a song that relates to Jane in a direct way. As a child I always loved the Kim Novak and William Holden film <em>Picnic</em> and used to always imagine what would have happened to the drifter and the beauty queen after they ran away, so I put those two things together.</p>
<h2>?All Of Our Friends Are Lonely?</h2>
<p>This song was based around Plato&#8217;s Retreat, the classic ?70s swingers establishment. One day Jane was chatting about how Plato&#8217;s had to move premises from the original New York location to Plato&#8217;s Retreat 2 in Florida (located at 321 West Sunrise) in 1985. At the time Jane was working on <em>One Life to Live</em>, which was being filmed in the area.  A lot of couples in the TV business supposedly frequented there, so an ?80s style swinging song seemed to be just the dish for our soap opera inspired romp. </p>
<blockquote><p>?An ?80s style swinging song seemed to be just the dish for our soap opera inspired romp.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jane mentioned how the people she knew who were patrons at Plato&#8217;s fit into two groups: in one group were the lonely couples wanting somehow to reconnect; and in the second group were couples who liked to watch the action and remain detached. This one caused a few arguments in the studio regarding the vibe: SIR wanted a Grace Jones ?80s atmosphere; Paul wanted a New Orleans jazzy feel. Being the adaptable crew we are, we went New Orleans. Special mention goes to Stephen Cummings who was Jane&#8217;s co-star here.</p>
<h2>?Why Don&#8217;t I Fall In Love Anymore??</h2>
<p>Gee this song takes me back.  At the time I really thought I wouldn&#8217;t ever be in love again. I know it seems very sad, but at the time I wasn&#8217;t sad, in fact it was kind of relaxing, even easy. I&#8217;m happy to say that it didn&#8217;t last forever and a couple of months later I met my beautiful wife. Anyway, not all stories end so well and Jane and I felt this one fitted into the TV vibe, being about the jaded older character who you know is not going to be on the little screen much longer and never gets a fun falling-in-love storyline.</p>
<h2>?Nursery Rhyme?</h2>
<p>Jane Badler: I wrote ?Nursery Rhyme?. I was intrigued by the notion of a person who can never forget or forgive. So instead of having a lifetime of love she chooses a lifetime of solitude and living life on the fringes. The title came in as a metaphor for the loss of innocence. I like the twisted tale it weaves inviting this person into her home years later and wanting to seduce and torture him through the nursery rhyme. Paul&#8217;s arrangement was perfect using the cello to enhance the darkness and eeriness of the mood. Also love the musical interludes which are a bit discordant.</p>
<h2>?What a Mess?</h2>
<p>Guilt is a funny thing. So often I&#8217;ve felt guilty about <a href="/articles/1006817">stories that get out</a> and people knowing about things I&#8217;ve said or done. Generally, however, after the public ridicule and embarrassment, these become light-hearted reminders of life&#8217;s journey. The things that never got out, on the other hand, stay with me on a day-by-day basis. These things have never become lighthearted in any way. The day I wrote that one was a bad day.</p>
<h2>?The Springs?</h2>
<p>I always loved the idea of Greta Garbo becoming a recluse and I wanted to write a song about the moment someone like that chooses to withdraw from the world. Retiring from anything strikes me as very romantic, be it cage-fighting, teaching, acting in soap operas or watching daytime TV. Giving something up forever always seems like an enormous deal, but actually I don&#8217;t know that it really is. The only thing that I enjoy more than a good retirement is a good comeback.</p>
