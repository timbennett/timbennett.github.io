                <h3>Hobart&#8217;s short-lived cult quartet got tapped by The Drones to play ATP, but is it a one-off or a proper reunion? <strong>TROY D COLVIN</strong> checks in with drummer Ianto Kelly.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3033824/450x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Among the stellar list of bands announced in The Drones? <a href="/news/4549460">second-round</a> line-up for their curated day of All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties in Melbourne was the surprising inclusion of a long-defunct band from Hobart called The Stickmen. Formed in 1996, The Stickmen made two albums and played close to 100 shows before disappearing in early 1999. In the ensuing years the band &#8211; Aldous Kelly (guitar/vocals), Luke Osborne (bass), Ianto Kelly (drums), Matt Geeves (turntables) &#8211; have achieved almost mythical status. This month they come together for the first time in 14 years to play the biggest show of their strange career. </p>
<p><strong>So how did the ATP invite come about?</strong><br/>
I saw [Drones drummer] Mike Noga the other day and he said he&#8217;s been playing The Stickmen in tour buses ever since he&#8217;s been in the Drones, and he got them around to it. He said those choices needed to be pretty unanimous, and they were all on board and they loved the idea. I think it was his little project, a labour of love. </p>
<p><strong>Are you excited?</strong><br/>
Incredibly excited. Aldous is coming from New Zealand; he&#8217;s really prolific and creative &#8211; he&#8217;s still doing a lot of music and visual art. Luke is in Canberra, and Matt is still in Hobart. My other band <a href="/articles/4540453">[The Spinning Rooms</a>] is reasonably fast and repetitive drumming, so I&#8217;m not out of shape. The drums in the Stickmen are simple so I&#8217;m fine. I think the other fellas are a bit worried. We&#8217;re going to do an intense week of rehearsals. We played all the time down in Hobart. Those connections you make, just being on stage together or in a rehearsal space, just playing, playing, playing &#8211; that runs really deeply. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be a problem; we&#8217;ll get into a room and think ?Wow, that&#8217;s always been there in the back of my mind.?</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve all remained friends?</strong><br/>
Yeah, we were best mates through high school, the three of us, like a little gang. Aldous, when he had a vision of that version of the band, he recruited us.</p>
<p><strong>Did The Stickmen rehearse much?</strong><br/>
We had so many songs we never played live. We used to have a whole set of really slow, dark, and sad music. We did a gig once where we played two sets &#8211; a whole set of slow stuff and a whole set of fast stuff. We had so many jams and ideas and noodling things. And we had heaps of stuff like, ?I&#8217;ll give you a nod to slow down, or maybe speed up. Depends what the nod&#8217;s like.?</p>
<blockquote><p>?We were too young and dumb to realise that we could&#8217;ve got our heads kicked in.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate any issues getting back to The Stickmen sound? I&#8217;m thinking of the turntables, particularly.</strong><br/>
The albums themselves are pretty ?live? recordings. What [turntablist] Matt did at any given point, no one knew. Maybe he played Torvill and Dean backwards instead of forwards; he was the wildcard element, which made it really interesting. Sometimes we could either not hear him at all or he&#8217;d be ear-splittingly loud. Whoever knew what was going to happen. So we&#8217;re not going to play a Don&#8217;t Look Back note-for-note, ?cause he doesn&#8217;t know the notes he plays.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be interpreting the music from your recollection of that time or with 14 years? post-Stickmen life experience?</strong><br/>
We have to go back in time in a way and be The Stickmen. Those songs came from that place and who we were back then. Trying to go back will be really interesting. Music&#8217;s a funny thing; little nuances will come out and those nuances will be 14 years of being different people. There&#8217;s some photos of us in makeup and drag; we did glam up a bit. I think we were too young and dumb to realise that we could&#8217;ve got our heads kicked in. Then again, we were in no way the most radical or weirdest of Tassie bands.  </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Is this the beginning of a Stickmen reunion?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not thinking ?Is this the beginning of The Stickmen MKIII??, but none of us are averse to kicking a few new songs around. You don&#8217;t have to be geographically in the same space anymore; the game has changed for that. We&#8217;re in four different places but that doesn&#8217;t actually mean anything now. You can actually be a band and do that &#8211; so we&#8217;ve got a couple of new ideas. What that means, I don&#8217;t know. Maybe that means we&#8217;ll record it as something for ourselves, maybe it means we&#8217;ll send it out on the internet. </p>
<p><strong>Do you feel any pressure?</strong><br/>
Yeah! It&#8217;s funny because we only did two albums and a few years together and I think part of the interest and intrigue of the band is that we didn&#8217;t continue. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure, I guess, but get four of us in a room and it&#8217;ll come back to us pretty naturally and who&#8217;s to say what it&#8217;s going to sound like? </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard ATP is a really respectful environment between artists. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be anyone looking for us to fail. I think that&#8217;s the beauty of it. It&#8217;s not like something we organised and said ?OK, listen to us, here we are again.? We&#8217;ve been asked really nicely to do this thing and because of that people will be looking for the good and trying to enjoy it and have fun. At the Hobart gigs, people danced all the time &#8211; not up-and-down dancing, side-to-side. So if there&#8217;s any of that, it&#8217;d be great.</p>
