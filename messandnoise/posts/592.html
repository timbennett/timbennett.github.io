                <h3>While other bands are out partying, Sydney&#8217;s Seekae are too busy playing LAN games backstage. Ahead of the release of second album &#8216;+DOME&#8217;, they talk to <strong>ANDREW MCMILLEN</strong> about poverty, illegal downloading and how they recently ?annihilated? Cloud Control on ?Starcraft?.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3019240/440x614-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Since releasing their debut album <em>The Sound Of Trees Falling On People* in December 2008, Sydney trio Seekae have become one of the most interesting independent acts in the country. Both in the studio and on stage, their set-up consists of laptops, MPCs, live drums, keyboards and melodica; their sound, a distinctive and complex brew of electronica. Rarely do vocals work their way into the mix, yet the band have a reputation for delivering: they won a Sydney Music, Art and Culture (SMAC) award in 2009 for ?Best Live Act?, and re-released *Trees</em> with a bonus disc of remixes (and a PVT cover) upon <a href="/news/3685251">signing</a> with indie label Rice Is Nice.</p>
<p>So how have the trio &#8211; John Hassell on synth/guitar, Alex Cameron on synth/drums and George Nicholas on synth/melodica &#8211; spent the couple of years between their debut album and its forthcoming follow-up, <em>+DOME*? Playing too much *Starcraft*, according to Nicholas, though he confirms they still attempt to record new ideas each day, even if most of it is ?absolute garbage?. It&#8217;s fitting that a video game would distract these three from their artistic calling; they were originally named after the DOS game *Commander Keen</em>, before shortening to a stylised version of its initials after discovering that the name had already been taken. </p>
<p>Though Cameron was initially scheduled to do this interview, some unexpected laptop problems ahead of a show supporting Mount Kimbie in Perth on the next night &#8211; simply, a computer wouldn&#8217;t turn on &#8211; caused him to flee to the nearest repairs store, leaving Nicholas to fill his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>There was an article published in <em>triple j mag</em> in March last year, where you wrote: &#8220;Musicians don&#8217;t have any money. They spend all the money they earned on new instruments and laptops.&#8221; Is this still the case?</strong><br/>
George: Yeah. I think I&#8217;m the poorest I&#8217;ve ever been, actually. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to hit the jackpot for a while. I hope we do, but we&#8217;ve still been eating spaghetti for a couple of weeks now, waiting for our cheque to come in.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re the poorest now that you&#8217;ve ever been?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I mean, we put some money into recording the album, and stuff like that. What people don&#8217;t understand is that, in order to write an album, you have to take a lot of time off work. You have to dedicate a lot of your time to doing it. I think that&#8217;s the main reason why we&#8217;re so poor, I guess. But it&#8217;s not that bad. We&#8217;re not entirely starving. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Does the lack of money bother you?</strong><br/>
No, it&#8217;s alright. I mean, it does bother me, because it&#8217;s always hard juggling a shitty day job and a band. A lot of my friends are going and getting real jobs and careers, but I look at this and just see &#8211; although I&#8217;m not being paid that much for it &#8211; it&#8217;s good to be able to do this stuff, and have people listen to it. It&#8217;s all fine. It&#8217;s all gravy! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>You also wrote that you have to ?try and convince security that an MPC drum machine is pretty much the same thing as a laptop, and that it was designed to destroy dancefloors, not jets?. I take it this conversation happens every time you&#8217;re in an airport.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah. We always get a few snickers and laughs every time we go through the x-ray machine. I carry all my stuff in my backpack. I carry my laptop, my soundcard, my hard drive, my MPC, my Kaos pad, all in one bag. There&#8217;s like 10 different things. It&#8217;s really absurd when you see someone taking out all these suspicious-looking things out of their bag. We get a lot of strange looks. But we always make it through, although every single we time go through, we get the explosives check. </p>

<strong>I remember seeing PVT tweet a photo from their tour in August last year, where you guys were playing <em>Starcraft</em> via LAN backstage before a show. The caption was &#8220;Rocknroll&#8221;.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] That&#8217;s indicative of all of our touring experiences. Instead of going out and partying, and doing all that stuff you&#8217;re supposed to do on tour, we&#8217;re usually just backstage watching YouTube, or playing *Starcraft*. The PVT guys were fantastic, but on the Cloud Control tour it was really good because Alistair, Luke and Jeremy are all big *Starcraft</em> players, so we were able to drop into Launceston&#8217;s only internet caf? and have a cheeky game. It was great.</p>
<p><strong>Is there an underground league of indie musicians playing ?Starcraft? that we don&#8217;t know about?</strong><br/>
Oh, maybe! I only know those guys. Actually, Ivan [Vizintin] and Anthony [Warwick] from Ghoul plays as well. Anthony is in the Gold League &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if that means anything to you, but it means he&#8217;s really good. [<em>Laughs</em>] There&#8217;s a few people who play. It&#8217;s definitely my favourite game. And I think we can all blame that game itself on the fact that this album took three years to make. </p>
<p><strong>So video games are a big source of procrastination for the band?</strong><br/>
Yeah. They work against us. They suck all the creativity out of us. We&#8217;re too busy forging battle plans, and thinking of ways to take down the Zerg overlords.</p>
<p><strong>Out of yourselves and Cloud Control, who dominated?</strong><br/>
We played a few games. We played a bit of <em>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare*. I think they won in that, but in *Starcraft 2</em>, we took them down. We annihilated them, in two or three matches. Straight wins. </p>
<p><strong>Some of your stuff reminds me of the soundtrack of a Nintendo GameCube game called <em>Metroid Prime</em>.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve never heard played that. I don&#8217;t know what that is. What&#8217;s that like?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a first-person shooter game based on the old side-scrolling <em>Metroid</em> games on the NES and SNES. There&#8217;s an ice world section, whose soundtrack has an electronic feel. Some of your music reminds me of that &#8211; which is a good thing, because it&#8217;s a great soundtrack.</strong><br/>
Oh, OK. Great! I&#8217;m happy about that. I mean, what makes a video game good for me; it&#8217;s not just the graphics and the gameplay, but also the soundtrack. I think it was the second <em>Splinter Cell</em>, which had a really amazing soundtrack. It was made by [Brazilian electronic artist] Amon Tobin. I liked the game, but it was really the soundtrack that kept me playing. It was constantly changing and evolving. I think that&#8217;s a really important part of gaming. This whole interview is about games!</p>
<p><strong>Is that OK with you?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s good! Heaps better than the usual, boring questions. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favourite game soundtrack?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;d be the second <em>Splinter Cell* game, or *Icy Towers</em>, which was an old platform game. It had a really cool, repetitive hip-hop loop behind it. That&#8217;s an old game.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the last of my gaming questions, unfortunately. What&#8217;s with that quote on your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Seekae/10592317582">Facebook</a>, in the ?About? section, where it says &#8220;They&#8217;re just pressing spacebar.&#8221;?</strong><br/>
Oh! [<em>Laughs*] That was because we played an absolutely dreadful show one night, supporting Mouse On Mars at the Oxford Arts Factory. We were really under-prepared. My computer was breaking, and all this kind of stuff. Just a terrible, terrible show; the worst show we&#8217;ve ever played. The crowd was getting a bit antsy, I think. We got heckled by this dude who yelled, ?They&#8217;re just pressing space bar!? And the whole crowd laughed. It was one of the most embarrassing things we&#8217;ve ever done. That&#8217;s why that&#8217;s on there, because some dickhead yelled that out. We weren&#8217;t just pressing space bar; we were pressing other keys, as well. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I read in a past interview that you guys try to record each day. Do you treat making music like a job?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s not like a job, because it&#8217;s fun. Sometimes there&#8217;s a lot of pressure, but a lot of it&#8217;s just recreational. It&#8217;s leisure. You get home from work, or university, and you turn on your computer or get out your microphone, and you make something. It gives that day a certain amount of validity. You can say, ?Oh, I wasted a whole day at work doing mind-numbing, boring stuff, but I actually created something that I like!? But usually you don&#8217;t create something you like; you create something that&#8217;s absolute garbage. But that&#8217;s the good thing about making something every day: nine days out of 10 will be crap, but one day you&#8217;ll make something good. You&#8217;ve just got to keep up the momentum.</p>

<strong>You keep referring to mind-numbing, crappy jobs. Is this true of your situation?</strong><br/>
Yes. I&#8217;ve got a pretty bad job. I work in an office in Chatswood, transcribing people&#8217;s conversations. It used to be really exciting, but I&#8217;m getting really sick of the same people having the same boring conversations. It&#8217;s for a voice recognition software company.</p>
<p><strong>As a journalist, I feel your pain.</strong><br/>
Because you&#8217;re going to have to listen back to this interview, and transcribe the whole thing! [<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Moving on. Is it true that the track &#8216;Rock&#8217;s Performance&#8217; is named after a MySpace comment?</strong><br/>
It is, actually, yeah. A chap from Italy, I think, didn&#8217;t have the best grasp of English. He made this incredible, incredible comment chock-a-block with misused superlatives and terrible grammar. And he finished it off with ?rocks performance?. So as a tribute to this guy, we thought we&#8217;d name a track after him. And it happens to be the most un-rockish track on the album.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a pain in the arse to name songs?</strong><br/>
Yeah. We don&#8217;t put too much thought into it, really. It&#8217;s not a pain in the arse, but it&#8217;s a thing that none of us really read into. They&#8217;re totally arbitrary. I think the main thing is because none of the tracks really have lyrics, there&#8217;s nothing to really name them after. Even the ones that do have lyrics, like ?Wool?; I don&#8217;t think Ivan [Vizintin, of Ghoul] sings ?wool? at all. It was called ?Turn To Stone?, but we called it ?Wool? just because &#8211; I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve never really named tracks after lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>How do you pronounce the new album&#8217;s name?</strong><br/>
Plus dome. A lot of people have been saying ?dome?. But it&#8217;s definitely ?plus dome?. You need the ?plus? there. That&#8217;s half of it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the final song, &#8216;You&#8217;ll&#8217;. It&#8217;s the least Seekae-sounding track I&#8217;ve heard from you.</strong><br/>
That was a weird one. That came up late in the mix, actually. John was just havin? a sing, and playing some guitar. He played it to me, and then we wrote a rogue synth line at the end, and put some effects on it. We weren&#8217;t really thinking about having it as a track, and then we were like, ?Ah, fuck it. It&#8217;s fine.? It doesn&#8217;t really fit, but I guess why it&#8217;s the last track.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pursue that style of songwriting more in future releases, or was it a once-off?</strong><br/>
I have no idea. Maybe. Probably not that exact kind of thing. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s going to be that many vocals [in future tracks]. But  &#8211; could be. We haven&#8217;t started writing new material yet. We&#8217;re going to the UK in May, and staying at John&#8217;s Mum&#8217;s house in Cambridge. We&#8217;re going to play some stuff over there. We&#8217;ll start writing an EP, or an album over there. That&#8217;s when we&#8217;ll start thinking about Seekae stuff. For now, in terms of writing new material, we&#8217;re more focused on writing solo stuff.</p>
<p><strong>I know you have other recording monikers, but I want to keep this conversation to Seekae. You mentioned the track &#8216;Wool&#8217; from the first album, featuring Ivan, which was one of the most striking songs. Will you be looking to collaborate with vocalists much in future recordings?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;d love to. It&#8217;d be really good to collaborate with vocalists. It&#8217;s always good to have a vocal on a track; I mean, in terms of getting exposure, having a vocal is an easy way for people to relate to a song. That&#8217;s not our main focus, but I definitely wouldn&#8217;t dismiss the idea of having some guest vocalists on the next release.</p>
<p><strong>Well, look at PVT, who added vocals on their last album. Maybe it&#8217;s coincidental, but they seem to be getting more exposure as a result of having words, and vocal hooks in their songs now.</strong>  </p>
<p>Certainly. Not having vocals, you&#8217;re immediately losing three-quarters of the music listening audience by having instrumental music. That&#8217;s totally understandable why they&#8217;ve had a rise in popularity, because they&#8217;ve added catchy lyrics. Their album is a lot more accessible than their last one.</p>
<p><strong>On the topic of PVT, I thought your cover of PVT&#8217;s &#8216;O Soundtrack My Heart&#8217; was beautiful. I know you&#8217;ve done some remixes, but have you done any other proper covers?</strong><br/>
Thank you. We sometimes do a live version of White Town&#8217;s ?Your Woman?. You know that [<em>sings</em>], ?I could never be your woman?? We play that one sometimes, which is pretty fun. I think that&#8217;s about it. I know John&#8217;s got a version of a J-Lo song up his sleeve. We&#8217;ve got a few, but we don&#8217;t usually play them live. </p>
<p><strong>I saw you live for the first time in April last year, at <a href="/events/2002807#review_3939940">Empire in Brisbane</a>. I was impressed by how you all synchronise your bobbing to the beat. Is that planned, or unintentional?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s just a natural, bodily response, I guess. We&#8217;ve got the snare drum to keep us in time. We don&#8217;t have any otherworldly connection between the three of us. It&#8217;s a purely natural thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Instead of going out and partying &#8211; we&#8217;re usually just backstage watching YouTube, or playing Starcraft.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>At that show, Alex only played live drums for a few songs &#8211; less than half of the set, I think. How do you decide which tracks to live-drum on?</strong><br/>
A few of the tracks on the new album have got live drums, but we play it by ear, really. We don&#8217;t want to force live drums onto things that don&#8217;t need it. I think roughly half of the songs now have live drums. We see if live drums work, and if they don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re pretty happy to scrap them. I think it&#8217;s important to add the drum element into it, just to give it another element of &#8211; live-ness, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re touring the UK and Europe from May onwards. Are those the band&#8217;s first shows overseas?</strong><br/>
Yeah. I&#8217;m really excited about it. We&#8217;re playing at The Great Escape festival in Brighton, and then a few other shows that I can&#8217;t talk about, because they haven&#8217;t been confirmed and it&#8217;d be really embarrassing if I told you and we didn&#8217;t end up playing them. But we&#8217;ll be playing a few shows over there.</p>
<p><strong>I have a feeling that, because you&#8217;re instrumental, it&#8217;ll take away any language barriers that would exist for other English-speaking bands playing in Europe.</strong><br/>
I hope so, yeah! I&#8217;ve never actually thought about that. It&#8217;s an interesting point. </p>
<p><strong>Hopefully some foreigners get into your stuff.</strong><br/>
Yeah, there won&#8217;t be that communication breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>Finally &#8211; I saw that the new album leaked a couple of days ago.</strong><br/>
Oh, I know! It&#8217;s pretty bad. I don&#8217;t know how that got out there. It must&#8217;ve been one of the people we gave out press copies to. But I&#8217;m not that fussed, really. I&#8217;ve been downloading illegal music since I was a young kid. It is a bit frustrating, but I&#8217;m kind of just happy that it was a good-quality rip, and that they had all the track names right. I know that our label will be a bit angry about that, but there&#8217;s nothing you can do, really.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider that kind of thing lost income for the band?</strong><br/>
Yeah, it is. But it&#8217;s also increased exposure. It might even out.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;d think that the people who&#8217;re downloading it are those who rabidly want to hear it, and who&#8217;ll therefore go to your shows, and buy your merch.</strong><br/>
Exactly. It was going to get illegally posted on the internet at some stage, anyway. It would be cool if we could have a big launch, where everyone could hear it around the same time, rather than dribs and drabs of some people hearing it, and then a few more. But at the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m not that fussed</p>
