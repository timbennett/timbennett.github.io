                <h3>Ahead of worldwide Record Store Day celebrations on Saturday, we asked seven stores how they&#8217;re celebrating the day and about the challenges they face in running an independent record store in an MP3 age.
</h3>
<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:3px;">Licorice Pie (Dave)</h2>
<h2>Prahran, Melbourne</h2>
<p><strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Our store doesn&#8217;t have much spare floor space between the racks, hence no live bands, but we are offering 15 percent off all stock for the day, and we have our resident hip hop guru Danielsan (Koolism) working the counter for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a celebration of the staying power and passion of people who are prepared to work hard to give the music loving community more variety and knowledge than what the major labels/music chain stores could possibly do. A love of music rather than a desire to line shareholder pockets is what drives the independent stores. Give ?em a cheer.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
Those bastards, the Australian Model Railway Association will go to any length to flog more toy trains, won&#8217;t they?</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
It appears all over the world the number of ?bricks and mortar? shops is shrinking, with a trend towards online convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
I personally want more than ?people who bought this also bought these titles? &#8211; and I think I am not alone there &#8211; I hope.</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Knowledge, understanding and a love of music versus ?would you like fries with that??</p>
<p/>

<strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We were hoping to put a show on, but we&#8217;ve had to delay it until the week after (April 25). Straight Arrows, Repo Man, Royal Headache and Bed Wettin Bad Boys at The Sando for $10. It&#8217;ll be huge! We&#8217;ll be having a huge punk sale in the store on Saturday though with CDs from $5 &#8211; good ones too.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Because we are a semi-redundant relic from a bygone era who require public sympathy to pay the bills.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
Looks lame as hell. Laughable even.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
If you&#8217;re independent, having the financial resources to get through slow periods, keeping people interested without a huge advertising budget and the worst retail mark-up margins going.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
If you can hang in there and keep fighting, why the hell not? As long as you offer something different and are as angry as me.</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Enthusiasm, knowledge, cash in hand. (That last one is a joke ATO.)</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:3px;">Missing Link (Dan)</h2>
<h2>CBD, Melbourne</h2>
<p><strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got five of our favourite new local indie/punk/bleurghhhh bands playing from 12pm-3pm: Repairs, Aktion Unit, Teen Archer, Wasted Truth and Dick Diver. We&#8217;re also using the day to kick off a belated Easter sale and are offering an additional discount on t-shirts/box sets (20 percent) and all other stock (10 percent). Plus giveaways, prize packs, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
The experience of interacting with independent music on a direct physical level is becoming underrated as the internet music culture marginalises ?real life? and larger chain stores are able to successfully market themselves as being part of the independent musical community. But the existence of indie stores in the face of this is testament that people <em>are</em> supporting them, so we see Record Store Day as a chance to mutually celebrate this. </p>
<p>Independent record stores have always been very important to cultivating and supporting new music, either by stocking the esoteric sounds of underground bands, having knowledgeable staff who care about music (everyone who works at these stores are usually active in bands, labels, fanzines, etc.) and are able to connect people to new and interesting things they wouldn&#8217;t stumble across in larger stores.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s disappointing, but understandable that larger music retailers would attempt to co-opt the spirit of a day supporting real music stores. However, it&#8217;s also an indication of how desperate retailers are becoming to appear like they have a connection to indie/underground/real music, because it&#8217;s obvious that people who care about music are still buying it. It&#8217;s just shaking hands and kissing babies in the hope to milk a little more money out of the MP3 generation.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
The economy! Also, strange sweaty men in purple capes who lurk in the corner of the room smelling like cheeseburgers and chanting Exploited lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
They will be overcome as increasingly larger chain stores stop stocking risky independent labels/bands and younger audiences find a connection with &#8220;searching out&#8221; new music as each generation has and will. We are seeing more and more people everyday who have started buying vinyl as a format long championed by smaller stores. We are seeing more and more people everyday who have decided they want to buy a new CD to hear a song as the artist intended (and not as a fragmented sound file on their MySpace page). The MP3 fad is evidently giving way as people seek to reconnect with songs again, and the vitality of any tune is weakened when digitalised (we invented this word). We obviously welcome this, both as retailers, producers and consumers of music.</p>
<p>The strange sweaty man phenomenon is Sisyphean. The sooner one leaves, another mind is warped and the cycles begins again.</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
I would suggest that indie record stores are in a symbiotic relationship with the independent music community, whereas multinational chains are parasitic and exploitative. As mentioned above, independent record stores are usually staffed by people with a strong connection to local music, so they are often staunchly supportive of new bands, offering them their first exposure to people outside of the live setting. They have stock of a specialised nature, providing people access to bands/music they wouldn&#8217;t come across in larger stores. </p>
<p>Before Sonic Youth or Nirvana or The Drones or Eddy Current Suppression Ring or Black Flag were played on national radio or had their records sprawled across the world, their releases would have been the buzz of these indie stores and the bands/labels/distributors/fanzines/customers/<em>Mess+Noise</em>s that support them.</p>
<p/>
<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:3px;">Rocking Horse (Warwick)</h2>
<h2>CBD, Brisbane</h2>
<p><strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We have three bands playing: Yves Klein Blue, Texas Tea and The Gin Club. We will also have various giveaways throughout the day.  </p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
I think people who could bear to get away from their computers for the day would be surprised to see that the culture of the record store is thriving. Apart from the good vibes of a record store with its posters, local scene info and interesting music playing, they will discover lots of cheap CDs which they imagine from their pre-download life as being $30, but are now often around $10. They might also find a great new influx of vinyl LPs, interesting books and T-shirts and, of course, the ability to talk with someone else who loves music. Record stores support up-and-coming local acts who get a chance to reach a wider audience by having their CDs in stock and doing in-stores etc.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
We are in Leading Edge and thus part of AMRA&#8217;s day. I would prefer that the day was more about indies as the true spirit of record store day implies, but I believe that it was deemed necessary for the chains to be involved to secure any kind of major coverage and funding for posters etc. this time around.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
Constantly being on top of deals that are coming through, remaining competitive with the chains as far as possible and exploring a more and more diverse and exclusive range of merchandise: vinyl, T-shirts, etc. And paying the rent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
Yes. Good stores will always remain.</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
See above.</p>

<h2>CBD and Fitzroy, Melbourne</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3003677/440x330-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="330"/><br/>
<strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got some help from our friends working behind the counter this year: Alan Brough and Myf Warhurst (<em>Spicks &amp; Specks*); Fee-B Squared and Michael Williams (*Triple R Breakfasters*); Marieke Hardy (triple j); Julie Zemiro (*RocKwiz</em>); and comedians Lawrence Leung, Andrew McClelland and Daniel Kitson. Twenty percent of all proceeds from CD/vinyl/DVD sales from the day will go to the Cancer Council, Victoria. The exact times they&#8217;re working are available at <a href="http://www.polyesterrecords.com">www.polyesterrecords.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re lucky there are so many indie stores in Melbourne but based on what is happening in the US and Europe, many stores may close in the near future. A day that raises any awareness can only be a good thing and may encourage a lot of people to visit a record store for the first time in ages. I think we often take for granted the cool small businesses we have around Melbourne, so I get saddened when anyone has to close a business they&#8217;ve put so much heart and hard work into.</p>

If they were genuine about it, they would&#8217;ve chosen another day, but I don&#8217;t really think it undoes the good things all the indie stores have planned for the day.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
The main challenge is dealing with the larger record companies. There&#8217;s been huge changes in the last decade, but I truly think a lot of record companies are stuck in the past. A lot of them find dealing with independent record stores a hindrance and prefer to just deal with the chains. I&#8217;ve been here 10 years and I&#8217;ve never had a call about how they could do things better and I&#8217;m sure every indie store around the country would say the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
I think there are huge opportunities for new labels, distributors, bands to do well in the future. I can&#8217;t see the majors changing so I think the future is bright for anyone that is innovative in the music industry.</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Real record stores don&#8217;t sell plasmas. As record store owners we&#8217;re all big music fans and aren&#8217;t motivated purely by share prices, profits and trying to crush competitors. I love the indie store community in Melbourne. I think it&#8217;s something as a city we should be extremely proud of.</p>

<strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We are having 10 percent off everything in the shop and in-store appearances: Magic Dirt&#8217;s Adalita on Saturday arvo and Mick Turner and Spencer P Jones on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
What is a city without cool record stores for fuck&#8217;s sake? Indie shops give a fuck about music and supporting unknown bands. They have always been an important part of the network that helps create the whole scene.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s outrageous that the giant franchises have taken this off us. This has been happening to indie stores for decades.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
Well, downloading has destroyed the whole world of music for a start. There has been NO major youth movement in rock&#8217;n?roll for a decade. Teenage apathy is a challenge and major chain stores cutting in and aping anything we do.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
Yeah, we can overcome these problems. There are still lots of people that are after vinyl and quality re-issues, and bless the people who refuse the download and wish to support bands and actually pay for their music. </p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Indie shops have always been run by passionate fans of music. They offer an experience and they offer passionate advice and knowledge. They always have rare vinyl, CDs and imports that the majors don&#8217;t.</p>

<strong>How is your store celebrating Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve got live music in the courtyard from 3pm-8pm. The Graveyard Sons will be launching their new EP, fantastic singer/songwriter Ben Smith will be performing solo, Dan Brodie will be unveiling his new band ?Dan Brodie &amp; Sons? and, as a finale, The Blackchords will be launching their new album which is already getting rave reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Why should people support Record Store Day?</strong><br/>
Indie record stores have had such a huge influence on music lovers but we are really struggling. You know the story &#8211; downloading (legal and illegal), CD burning, chain-store discounting, etc. &#8211; so I won&#8217;t bother going into it in detail. But if every true music lover in Melbourne said they were going to buy a CD a week and each week went to a different indie store and bought something recommended by the staff, every record store in Melbourne would survive. And, at the end of the year, each punter would have 52 fantastic CDs across a huge range of music. Sadly, it probably won&#8217;t happen so that&#8217;s why Record Store Day has to be supported.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the Australian Music Retailers? Association&#8217;s rival Record Store Day Australia?</strong><br/>
Well, I understand why a lot of indies are pissed off and I was too, but I guess on reflection I&#8217;ve got a bit philosophical about it. A wild animal has to eat or it dies. If you get in the way and get eaten, you can&#8217;t really be angry at the animal. It has no emotion, it&#8217;s just doing what it does to survive. The best way is to not be in the same environment as it. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why indie stores have to offer alternatives to the chains. Try to compete with them and you&#8217;ll get eaten. Why indie stores are pissed off &#8211; at the risk of labouring the wild animal metaphor &#8211; is that we found something that can help us survive (Record Store Day) and the lion is trying to drive us off so it can eat the whole thing itself.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges of running a record store in 2009?</strong><br/>
We host 10-12 in-stores each month and it never ceases to amaze me how hard it is to sell CDs. Now I don&#8217;t want to criticise my customers too much, but our in-stores are free entry and I&#8217;ve had a courtyard of 50 people absolutely blown away by an artist. They&#8217;ve cheered for an encore and then at the end, when I&#8217;ve asked them if they want to buy a $10 EP of the band, they say no. On Record Store Day you can bet I&#8217;ll be a bit more persuasive.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think those challenges can be overcome?</strong><br/>
We were able &#8211; after an 18-month battle with red tape &#8211; to open a bar and venue in our courtyard. We&#8217;re selling more beer these days than records, but the extra revenue stream has allowed us to have the record store we always wanted to offer our customers but couldn&#8217;t afford. Sales of music have risen with the better stock we have on our shelves and the extra time that punters spend in the store. But to be honest, I think without the bar/venue we would have had to close our doors. It&#8217;s pretty tough. On the other hand, it&#8217;s pretty easy to keep your favourite store open. Once in a while buy a bloody record!</p>
<p><strong>What do independent record stores offer that multinational chains don&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Personal service; an investment in the customer, in that we really need them to come back; and, above all, a love of music. I&#8217;m not saying that the kids who work in chain stores don&#8217;t love music but do they <em>really</em> love music? Know what I mean? I&#8217;ve never met an owner of an indie record store who was stupid. These are people who could succeed running any other business if they put their mind to it, but they love music so much they&#8217;ve invested everything into it &#8211; and not just money. They get a kick out of spreading the word about their favourite music. They delve beyond the current release sheets that the labels send them. They have a spirit of adventure and exploration. Music is their career and their life &#8211; not just something to see them through uni until they can get a real job. Possibly the only irrational thing they&#8217;ve ever done in their life is buy a bloody record store. But thank god they did!</p>
