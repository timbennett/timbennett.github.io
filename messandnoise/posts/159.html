                <h3>How do you cope with a grueling tour schedule that will see you play 41 shows in 46 days? By trying to keep your shit together, The Datsuns? Christian Livingstone tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002053/440x660-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="660"/><br/>
Australia&#8217;s proud tradition of sweaty bar bands &#8211; from AC/DC to the Beasts of Bourbon, The Lime Spiders to Lobby Loyde &#8211; never really caught on with our antipodean peers. In New Zealand, it&#8217;s all about that jingly, jangly Flying Nun sound.</p>
<p>Such is the label&#8217;s influence that when Triple J compiled a list of the 30 greatest New Zealand acts of all time in 2000, 20 of those bands were on Flying Nun. For The Datsuns &#8211; a sweaty bar band &#8211; playing rock&#8217;n?roll in New Zealand was like being the only bouzouki group in town.</p>
<p>?In New Zealand, local bands were indie bands; Flying Nun bands like The Verlaines, The Chills and The Bats,? says guitarist Christian Livingstone. ?We were nothing like that so we were kind of ostracised at the time. A lot of the stuff I listened to was stuff from the ?60s and ?70s, you know, Zeppelin and T-Rex.? </p>
<p>So when you model yourself on big mythological rock bands, it&#8217;s almost a given that you hit the proverbial road. It&#8217;s why The Datsuns through rain (their difficult sophomore LP <em>Outta Sight, Outta Mind*), hail (2006?s critically panned *Smoke &amp; Mirrors*) and shine (their acclaimed self-titled debut) have always found solace in a tour van. When I speak to Livingstone, he&#8217;s ?somewhere in Germany? midway through a grueling two-month tour of their new record *Headstunts</em> that will eventually encompass Australia and their ?hometown? of New Zealand. Inverted commas denote that the band is now scattered across the globe.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re doing 41 shows in 46 days?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve only had one day off in the past month. That&#8217;s the way we like to roll.</p>
<p><strong>How do you cope with a schedule like that?</strong><br/>
You get really tired &#8211; There&#8217;s not as many shenanigans as there used to be. We try and keep our shit together basically.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from touring with a band like the Hellacopters?</strong><br/>
We also toured with them years ago in 2002. It&#8217;s wonderful to share the stage with such a fine, great rock&#8217;n?roll band who are so enthusiastic and passionate about it every night. Getting to see somebody who has the same enthusiasm for rock&#8217;n?roll as you do, and who gives 110 percent each night, it&#8217;s really an inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>I was reading an interview where [singer/bassist] Dolf [de Borst] said that touring with bands like The Hellacopters was like rock&#8217;n?roll university.</strong><br/>
Their devotion to rock&#8217;n?roll and stagecraft is exceptional. When we were starting out in New Zealand, there were no rock&#8217;n?roll bands. We were kind of the only one. We never got to see other people doing or playing the kind of thing we liked or wanted to play. And when we got to play shows with them, it was like, ?These guys are doing the same thing we want to do.? It was really great to see it up close.</p>
<p><strong>Where does your hard touring ethic come from?</strong><br/>
If you&#8217;re playing rock&#8217;n?roll, you should be out there on a stage playing rock&#8217;n?roll. You shouldn&#8217;t be sitting there twiddling your thumbs counting beans or something. Rock&#8217;n?roll is something best expressed and enjoyed on a stage. If you&#8217;re in a rock&#8217;n?roll band, you should put your money where your mouth is and play as many shows as you can.</p>
<p><strong>In that respect, is it difficult to come home?</strong><br/>
When you&#8217;re on the road, after a while you want to go home for a little bit. But as soon as you&#8217;re home you want to go back out on the road. It&#8217;s kind of a catch-22, you&#8217;re never happy where you are.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when you&#8217;re off the road so to speak?</strong><br/>
Everybody retreats to their respective corner and does nothing for a little while. I&#8217;ll get bored and start trying to write songs, I&#8217;m sure Dolf does the same. You twiddle away the time down the pub, or doing your laundry or whatever, until you eventually have to get back in the studio or something.</p>
<p><strong>Given that the live arena is your bread and butter, what&#8217;s it like making a record?</strong><br/>
Making a record is a totally different mindset. On stage, everything happens in the moment. It goes by and there&#8217;s no changing or stopping or doing it again. We&#8217;re a spur of the moment kind of band in that respect. When you get into the studio you start analysing things. You have to put on a different hat &#8211; It&#8217;s not something we necessarily enjoy but we&#8217;re better at it than we used to be. We know how to record ourselves as a band. The last two records reflect that a lot more. They&#8217;re more versatile, sonically-interesting records than the first two.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your new record, <em>Headstunts</em>?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a logical step on from <em>Smoke &amp; Mirrors</em> &#8211; It&#8217;s still a rock&#8217;n?roll record but it&#8217;s a more diverse rock record. There are different elements and different sound that are incorporated into our sound &#8211; There&#8217;s a lot more pop in there, there&#8217;s blues. It&#8217;s more of a varied melting pot than our previous records.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting, because a lot of reviewers talk about it being a back-to-basics kind of record. What do you make of that?</strong><br/>
People said that about the last record [laughs]. Every record is back to basics, every record&#8217;s a comeback, a return to form. It&#8217;s a journalistic cop-out basically. I see it [the record] as a logical evolution.</p>
<p><strong>There are some strong power-pop overtones. Were those the sorts of bands you were listening to?</strong><br/>
Not necessarily, but those are the bands that are in our blood. We&#8217;ve always been massive fans of Cheap Trick and Red Kross. There&#8217;s always been an element of that in our sound and I think it&#8217;s what sets us apart from more traditional hard rock bands. That sort of melodic element. We do have a love of a good melody.</p>

<p><strong>Ironically though, you parted ways with your last label [V2 Records] because they didn&#8217;t see commercial potential in you.</strong><br/>
We have a different label in Europe and America than we do in Australia and New Zealand. They put more effort into burying the last record than they did promoting it. And then they collapsed because of the declining economy &#8211; so we ended up with a new deal with a new label [Cooking Vinyl]. The new label is into us. They&#8217;ve got no money, but they like us [laughs]. They return our phone calls, so it&#8217;s a step forward in that respect.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true you recorded the album in a barn in Germany?</strong><br/>
We went to this studio in a barn in West Germany. We were going to record it there, but we ended up just writing the record there for about six months. We were writing and playing the odd show. We ended up recording in Gothenburg, Sweden, in a studio that belongs to The Soundtrack of Our Lives.</p>
<p><strong>Given that you all live in different countries how does the writing process work?</strong><br/>
It wasn&#8217;t until we finished doing the record that we split up and lived apart. Previous to that we all lived together. It didn&#8217;t really affect this record, but it might affect the next.</p>
<p><strong>You might have to start making records like the Postal Service.</strong><br/>
Yeah, we&#8217;re a bit more 21st century than that. I&#8217;ve been writing stuff and sending it [via email] to Dolf and he&#8217;s been emailing me back as well. We&#8217;ve embraced the digital era in that respect.</p>
<p><strong>How has the addition of new drummer Ben Cole changed the dynamics of the band?</strong><br/>
He is a very old friend. I&#8217;ve known him for a long time. He&#8217;s a great drummer, very versatile. He&#8217;s able to play different kinds of style more consistently than our previous drummer &#8211; His addition to the band has allowed us to be more experimental.</p>
<p><strong>You spend an awful lot of time in Europe touring. Do you think that continent&#8217;s more conducive to the style of music you play?</strong><br/>
You can tour for a lot longer here. There are a lot of countries clumped together with a lot more people. Things are less dictated by fashion and trend over here &#8211; It&#8217;s very interesting for us, coming from an island at the bottom of the world, to spend a lot of time encountering different cultures and languages.</p>
<p><strong>Do you enjoy coming back to Australia?</strong><br/>
Australia is a really great place for us &#8211; There&#8217;s a big love for rock&#8217;n?roll in Australia. We used to tour Australia and not tour New Zealand way back in the day, because nobody in New Zealand was into rock&#8217;n?roll. We always spin through Australia in 10-12 days, so maybe we should spend some more time there.</p>
<p><strong>Any favourite venues in Australia</strong><br/>
The Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne is always a good show. It&#8217;s a great venue, everyone can see, the sound&#8217;s great, the vibe&#8217;s always great.</p>
