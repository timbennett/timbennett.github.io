                <h3>New ABC 2 series &#8216;I Rock&#8217; attempts to depict the trials and tribulations of a struggling rock band in modern-day Sydney, but it&#8217;s little more than misrepresentations and well-worn cliches, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong>.

<p><img class="c" data-src="/images/3010994/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Write about what you know. It&#8217;s the first thing you learn in Scriptwriting 101, but it&#8217;s somehow eluded Josh Mapleston, the stand-up comic and onetime Air Guitar finalist behind new ABC2 series <em>I Rock</em>.</p>
<p>Premiering earlier this week on Aunty&#8217;s newly branded digital channel, the show ostensibly tells the story about an indie rock band trying to make it big on the Australian music scene, and it&#8217;s already being swallowed whole by several mainstream TV writers who have praised it for being ?true to life? and screaming ?authenticity?. That couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The show, like Alex Proyas? <a href="/discussions/490664">trainwreck</a> <em>Garage Days</em> (2002), presents a rock&#8217;n?roll fantasy world that&#8217;s more likely to exist in Mapleston&#8217;s head than the inner-city Sydney of today. What&#8217;s more troubling is that it&#8217;s being sold to ABC2?s youth demographic as being somehow representative of what it&#8217;s like to be in an independent rock band in 2010. </p>
<p>If that were the case, the show&#8217;s fictitious and relatively obscure group Boy Crazy Stacey &#8211; who claim to be ?post-rock?, but look and sound decidedly ?nu rock? circa 1998 &#8211; would certainly not be playing to a room full of fist-pumping punters at The Annandale on a weeknight, let alone backing it up with an EP launch at the same venue 10 days later. In fact, they&#8217;d be lucky to get a gig at all given the scarcity of live venues in Sydney following the <a href="/news/3761449">closure</a> of The Hopetoun Hotel in September; the oppressive <a href="/news/3809666">pay-to-play</a> conditions enforced by venues like The Sando; and council&#8217;s gradual erosion of Marrickville&#8217;s warehouse scene.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that a month prior to shooting footage of You Am I at The Annandale for the show, a story was published in <em>The SMH</em> detailing the dire situation facing that very pub and Sydney&#8217;s music scene at large. Titled <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/call-for-live-aid/2009/10/08/1254701097561.html">?Call for live aid?</a>, the article detailed how The Annandale was facing imminent closure after an eight-year dispute with Leichhardt Municipal Council over noise compliance, late trading and development applications. It quoted Oxford Art Factory general manager Mark Gerber as saying that venues simply didn&#8217;t have the numbers to promote live music as a ?seven-day-a-week venture?, and claimed that The Hoey&#8217;s closure could probably have been avoided if people ?actually went to see a band and bought a beer?. What a different picture the show paints.</p>
<p>Of course, no one expects such ?mundanities? to drive the action of a lighthearted comedy, but if you&#8217;re going to purport to tell a story about Sydney&#8217;s independent rock scene at least give it a believable context. Instead, <em>I Rock* paints an unhelpfully rosy picture of Sydney as some sort of rock&#8217;n?roll utopia, where bands help themselves to beers from the bar fridge, major record label A&amp;Rs actually attend gigs and enthusiastic punters pack out venues night after night. Say what you will about *Garage Days</em>, but even that film charted the ongoing battles between live music venues and pokies.</p>
<blockquote><p>?&#8217;I Rock&#8217; paints an unhelpfully rosy picture of Sydney as some sort of rock&#8217;n?roll utopia, where bands help themselves to beers from the bar fridge [and] major record label A&amp;Rs actually attend gigs.?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising then to learn that Mapleston himself is writing the show from the outside pissing in. While it certainly doesn&#8217;t take a rock&#8217;n?roll musician to write a great rock script &#8211; Aaron Sorkin never worked in the White House, and yet he still managed to create the utterly believable <em>West Wing</em> &#8211; it&#8217;s worth noting that Mapleston&#8217;s research primarily consisted of getting drunk and going to gigs. That&#8217;s all well and good if you&#8217;re writing a show about a punter, but the show&#8217;s protagonist is an independent musician and a self-described ?proud member? of Sydney&#8217;s live music community. In a recent interview, Mapleston casually admitted that he hadn&#8217;t actually met many working musicians, but once lived in a sharehouse with an aspiring rocker who slept ?on a foam mattress in the middle of a bare room?. It&#8217;s this narrow frame of reference that informs the show&#8217;s lead character Nash Taylor (who&#8217;s not a spoonerism for Even&#8217;s Ash Naylor, because Mapleston doesn&#8217;t actually know who he is).</p>
<p>Taylor (played by Mapleston himself) is a throwback; a living, breathing rock dinosaur who harbours delusions about ?making it? like people once did in the ?90s: put out a record, get signed by a major and the next thing you know you&#8217;re snorting coke off a Playmate&#8217;s chest. Given he&#8217;s been plugging away at the live music thing for five years, surely he&#8217;d know better.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he wakes up in a leather jacket at 5pm, drinks bourbon from the bottle and lives in a grotty sharehouse with what appears to be the show&#8217;s entire cast. They include Luke, the band&#8217;s deadshit drummer (is there any other kind?); Taylor&#8217;s annoying corporate brother Jasper, who effortlessly switches from bass to lead guitar when a member quits; and floozy ex-girlfriend Jane, who pens a music blog called premenstrualasanything.com and always seems up for a casual shag. (The other women in the show are either cast as ditzy musos with skimpy outfits, groupies or aggressive lesbians who hate men). As for Taylor, he&#8217;s sick of playing support to the next big thing and decides to get serious, which according to the show&#8217;s extensive press materials, involves playing major festivals, shooting an inspired film clip and flirting with some hip label ?wankers?. Yes, it&#8217;s really that easy.</p>
<p>While a casual perusal through Melband&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ausband.com.au/modules.php&#8217;name=Forums">forums</a> or the triple j ?Unearthed? <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/">website</a> proves that careerists like Taylor still exist, for once it&#8217;d be nice to watch a show about <em>real* musicians in *real* bands who harbour no illusions about fame and notoriety, and just play music for music&#8217;s sake. There&#8217;s probably a genius tragi-comedy lurking in the career trajectory of bands like Gaslight Radio or The Fauves (see *15 Minutes To Rock</em>), who have endured all the highs and lows of the music business, only to find themselves balding, middle-aged and yet still soldiering on. Tim Rogers, who makes a cameo as himself in episode one, would be great fodder too: here&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s scaled rock&#8217;s so-called heights only to find himself playing gigs from week to week to pay the rent.</p>
<p>Mapleston would probably argue that no one would be interested in characters such as these because they simply don&#8217;t conform to the public&#8217;s idea of what a rock musician actually is. My point is that it&#8217;s a perception worth changing. At a time when the music industry is in a state of flux, when pubs and labels are shutting at an alarming rate, and when stars are (temporarily) born, not on the stages of The Annandale or The Hoey, but on reality TV shows like <em>Idol* (take a bow, <a href="/news/3409773">Wes Carr</a>), a show like *I Rock</em> has never seemed so irrelevant. In that case, let&#8217;s judge it for what it is: a vapid rom-com, and not a very good one at that.</p>
