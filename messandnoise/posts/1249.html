                <h3>Two years after his bandmates vacated The Vines, <strong>CRAIG NICHOLLS</strong> has regrouped with bassist Tim John and drummer Lachlan West for the double album ?Wicked Nature?, which is being called his heaviest work to date. Below, Nicholls gives M+N the exclusive rundown on The Vines? ambitious return.

<h2>Disc 1</h2>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/41581794%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8f5qu&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Metal Zone?  </h2>
<p>?Metal Zone? is the opener and the first single as well. The producer [of disc 1] Paul McKercher had a guitar with a homemade pickup on it. It was really cheap and I wanted to use it, so we used it on the beginning of that. It&#8217;s got a lot of attitude, that song. It could have a double meaning &#8211; in the verses it&#8217;s pretty straight-ahead. It&#8217;s mostly attitude and one of the heaviest songs.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Ladybug?  </h2>
<p>This also has a double meaning. Songs are kind of like poetry. The double meaning is, for me, like having a girlfriend or a wife. I don&#8217;t know how cold that sounds. It goes along with all the other things I hate &#8211; no computers, no mobile phones, no cars, no women. No nothing. I just want to evaporate. So that&#8217;s more attitude &#8211; I don&#8217;t need anything or anyone.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Green Utopia?  </h2>
<p>Another double meaning! What I was thinking is that where I live is very green &#8211;  wicked nature. It sounds like punk, and it is, but the chorus is talking about nature and my preference for that.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Psychomatic?  </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a made-up word. I guess it&#8217;s like being automatically psycho. Again, it&#8217;s talking about driving cars, which I don&#8217;t like. I have problems with a lot of things, more against society and people, so it&#8217;s about how I think being tripped out is a better way to be. Psychomatic to me just seems like everything is out of control, all the people in the world.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Killing the Planet?  </h2>
<p>This one&#8217;s got the most lyrics in it. It&#8217;s kind of environmental. I just can&#8217;t stop singing about things like this &#8211; it&#8217;s what&#8217;s most important to me. It&#8217;s kind of just about people, again &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a problem! There&#8217;s too many people.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Anything You Say?  </h2>
<p>I really like this one because it&#8217;s got a hussy melody. Most of the songs, at least from the first [half of the] record, are more serious, but this one is kind of fun, just more about guys and girls and me again saying I live by the music.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Venus Fly Trap?  </h2>
<p>This is kind of dark. It has a very serious feel to it. It&#8217;s the wicked nature theme &#8211; a girl as a Venus fly trap. But I&#8217;m saying bad things about the guy as well. So I guess it&#8217;s an anti-love song.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Good Enough?  </h2>
<p>I really thought maybe that should be a single. It&#8217;s kind of different but it&#8217;s got a very tight arrangement. It feels very catchy, if I can say that about one of my own songs. The chorus sounds very happy.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Out of the Loop?  </h2>
<p>I like this one because it&#8217;s probably the fastest one we did. It&#8217;s random lines and not specifically about one thing. It&#8217;s a punk song.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Wicked Nature?  </h2>
<p>I remember finishing off little bits of lyrics right before we went in and recorded. I had this song but I just I didn&#8217;t know what to call it, so I called it ?Wicked Nature? because I knew that&#8217;s what we were calling the album. It&#8217;s a different one for us. It comes at the end and it&#8217;s much longer than the usual songs we have. It&#8217;s a bit of a space-jam, which I really like doing in the studio. It&#8217;s more abstract alongside the tighter arrangements.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Into the Fire?  </h2>
<p>This has got a kind of religious theme or feel to it. It&#8217;s very serious and kind of epic. I was raised in a bit of a religious family, I went to a Catholic school &#8211; it&#8217;s all a bit of a crazy thing. It&#8217;s really deep and scary as well.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Disc 2</h2>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/41586384%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-C0beU&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Reincarnation?  </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s really spacey. It&#8217;s a different feel, cleaner. It picks up where ?Into the Fire? finished the first record, from death to rebirth. What I&#8217;m saying is that time never ends, so it&#8217;s more about time.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Love Is Gone?  </h2>
<p>This one is kind of a cleaner, more ?60s-sounding song and, again, it&#8217;s about how I have a problem with love. It&#8217;s about men and women and that struggle which I imagine or perceive or which you get from other people&#8217;s music. It&#8217;s just meant to be fun.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Truth?  </h2>
<p>This one is very serious, almost like a hymn. It&#8217;s just something that my brother had said to me that made me write this song, and it was very simple.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Slightly Alien?  </h2>
<p>This is another very quiet song &#8211; a nylon-string acoustic, brushes on the drum kit. I guess again that&#8217;s me singing about my alienation. But hopefully it sounds nice. It&#8217;s more about character and having a good vibe. </p>
<p/>
<h2>?Everything Else?  </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty nasty sounding. Again, it&#8217;s some of the anger I have and I&#8217;m singing about. It sounds very bratty but that&#8217;s okay &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s alright to be like that.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Fly Away?  </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s very basic. The words are repeated over and over. It&#8217;s meant to be a mellow little song &#8211; there&#8217;s not much in it. It&#8217;s a bit of a country song.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Girl I Want?  </h2>
<p>This one is more ?60s. It&#8217;s got a big chorus in it. The harmonies are so high, I was just screaming to reach the notes. They might be a bit out of tune but again, it&#8217;s the character thing and just going for it. It turned out pretty good.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Clueless?  </h2>
<p>This was an older song, which was sort of an instrumental but I added some more words to it. It&#8217;s really strange sounding, Indian or something. I kind of like it.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Darkest Shadow?  </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s very, very fast. It was fun to do. It&#8217;s simple and we did it really quick. It&#8217;s like ?Out of the Loop? &#8211; the words are just things I thought or felt. ?Darkest Shadow? &#8211; that&#8217;s what I feel like sometimes. It&#8217;s very strange to be living in the Stone Age at this time. That&#8217;s why I just try to cling to music.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Funny Thing?  </h2>
<p>This is just kind of sad. Things about me again. It&#8217;s just like, ?Why is it so difficult? Why do I have this problem and will I be able to survive or relate to people?? I think I&#8217;m really sensitive and that&#8217;s what this is. Being a songwriter, that&#8217;s a good thing. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
