                <h3>Melbourne electronic quartet <strong>YOLKE</strong> launched their second EP while touring the US West Coast with <a href="http://fallopiantunes.com">Fallopian Tunes</a> colleagues Big Yawn and <a href="/news/4559193">Document Swell</a>. Then they hit Mexico City and beyond on their own. Their adventures spanned warehouse shows, icy swims, coastal drives, one sorry hoopty, a psychedelic pig roast, a crashed tour van and a slow-talking cowboy won over by the music.

<h2>LA  </h2>
<p>Errol <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=uto_q6iSlEE">Green]?s pastrami chilli cheese fries sets a precedent for the rest of our time in the States. Make a few [LA-inspired video clips</a>. Buy a car off someone in South Central. (Don&#8217;t drive too fast around here; there&#8217;s kids around. Turns out the car couldn&#8217;t make it past second gear. The transmission was fucked.) Escape from LA. Lose our shit driving through canyons. Experience real terror while operating the hoopty in blizzard conditions. Stay in an American Indian reservation. Bought fireworks. Lots of driving, listening to everything from Autechre to Michael Hurley. Vegas was in there somewhere as well.</p>

<h2>Texas  </h2>
<p>We arrived in Austin a week early; it was SXSW and we wanted to experience all the flavours Austin had to offer. The rest of our Fallopian Tunes homies joined us over the next few days &#8211;  the insipid duo <a href="http://fallopiantunes.com/big-yawn/">Big Yawn</a> and tropical doof captain <a href="http://fallopiantunes.com/document-swell/">Document Swell</a> &#8211; and things quickly slipped into rudeness. Like Errol&#8217;s chilli cheese fries, starting with such debauchery means only improvement from then on in.</p>
<blockquote><p>?In Austin [psychedelic] means throwback ?60s- or ?70s-sounding bands like The Brian Jonestown Massacre or The Black Angels, long hair, paisley and wah-wah pedals.?</p></blockquote>
<p>SXSW was fantastic. None of us had the dollars to fork out for passes but with free Stones Throw, Not Not Fun and Brainfeeder showcases and fucking madness in the streets, we&#8217;re well entertained. Our first gig of the tour was at a free SXSW party, a psychedelic pig roast that had mutants flocking to the party for a taste of all the free shit they could consume. Was a great time &#8211; had a lively enough crowd who were all intrigued by our colourful take on psychedelic. (In Austin it seems that genre means throwback ?60s- or ?70s-sounding bands like The Brian Jonestown Massacre or The Black Angels, long hair, paisley and wah-wah pedals.) And with the devil&#8217;s dandruff crusting the highways of the Lone Star State, we&#8217;re rolling deep on the night train, sucking back road lines with fury.</p>

<h2>Portland  </h2>
<p>After a bleary-eyed flight to Seattle and much time contemplating the connotations of the grunge capital&#8217;s Space Needle, we picked up the van and all seven of us drove down to Portland. Our first gig in Portland was on St. Paddy&#8217;s Day (a holiday we ignored when booking the gig) at a little bar in the city, Valentines. Was a bit of a flop in the end; the city was raging with wigged-out, green-wigged shenanigans and Valentines was tucked in between two Top 20 doof clubs, so anyone who would have come down to the gig thought better of it. However, we did play with an awesome group <a href="http://dogdazetapes.bandcamp.com/album/twins">Twins</a> from the <a href="http://cgifriday.blogspot.com.au">CGI Friday label</a>. Much love to fanny packs and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=y3JVsmaWvpQ&amp;list=PL19B3DCEC5AC0DC6F">John Tesh</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We sat and watched freight trains go by once all the booze was gone.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The second Portland show was upstairs at an Ethiopian restaurant (Habesha). A great way to balance the scale in Oregon with a banger of an evening. Great music from Portland locals Esses and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/magisterial">Magisterial</a>. Big Yawn <a href="http://youtu.be/QuDG8CFCCNk">killed it</a> that night! We all were well fucked thanks to the hysterical Papi Fimbres of Esses, who seemed to be about to explode from his love of all things Australian (?AHHHHHHH!!! YOU AUSTRALIANS ARE SO FUCKING GORGEOUS!! I JUST WANNA FUCK MY OWN DICK IN HALF!?). We went to Papi&#8217;s studio after the gig, had loose jams until the wee hours of the morning, then sat and watched freight trains go by once all the booze was gone.</p>

<p/>
<h2>Seattle  </h2>
<p>Drove back up to Seattle for the next show. The gig itself wasn&#8217;t all that &#8230; but we had a slow-talking cowboy rock up who dug our tunes. Real smooth guy. Didn&#8217;t even let the leather crease in his boots while he tapped along to Document Swell. Got put up by the lovely Randall (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/rainbow-wolves">Rainbow Wolves</a>), who we played with at the show. He was a dude &#8211; took a day off work to show us round Seattle. Record shops, Kurt&#8217;s house and a diner with a wallet-and-cigarette-stealing, ticket-to-Hawaii-buying, dry-wit-having, smoking-hot waitress. Icy cold swims in the Seattle harbour, green washes at the arboretum.</p>

<p/>
<h2>Oakland  </h2>
<p>We took the long way down to the Bay Area. We had three days up our sleeve and decided to cruise the 101 all the way down the coast. I gotta say it was bloody nice! The northwest coastline is some of the most spectacular shit I&#8217;ve ever seen. Pine forest meets sand dunes all the way along the Oregon coast, with rock formations that make the Great Ocean Road look like 2D sandcastles.</p>
<p>Arriving in Oakland we meet up with a Silicon Valley Australian expat (mates of some of the fellas in the car). He was up for a big night, constantly feeding us booze and candy well before the show started. We played at Night Light in downtown Oakland (which is mainly warehouses and dilapidated buildings). Show was good but the party afterwards was more entertaining. We somehow ended up back at some warehouse with a bunch of people from the gig. An old mate who had seen us play was really keen to show us his DJ skills and two-storey indoor swing setup, and things escalated from there. Doofing well into the morning.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3035367/630x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<h2>San Francisco  </h2>
<p>Our gig at Dolores Park got canned; the booker thought it was cool to double-book the night then give it to a bunch of local musicians who hadn&#8217;t travelled halfway across the world to play. But a few free days in San Fran wasn&#8217;t such a bad place to rinse a couple of days. A fantastic city, but lots of homelessness. Had some rare moments in Tenderloin and got spiritual climbing the hilly footpaths of Van Ness.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Back in LA  </h2>
<p>This was the last leg of the tour for our Fallopian Tunes brothers Document Swell and Big Yawn. We had two gigs in LA to round off the American leg of the trip: one at some shot-through dive bar in Santa Monica (TRiP Bar), the other at a sweet little warehouse near Chinatown. Don&#8217;t really want to relive the TRiP bar gig; half the time most of the dudes were sleeping in the van (only waking up to play). The magic school-bus warehouse show was great though. Met a lovely crew of likeminded musicians, had jams, BBQ, skateboard dance floor, played a few songs then brought the party outside to contend with the LA Council&#8217;s fundraising event. Needless to say, the suits didn&#8217;t hang around too long.</p>

<blockquote><p>?There&#8217;s something familiar about the LAPD siren; it&#8217;s in all the NWA records, GTA games and cop shows.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Had a couple more days in LA before the others went back to Melbourne. Managed to crash the tour van the day before we had to return it &#8230; yet another experience with the LAPD. There&#8217;s something familiar about the LAPD siren; it&#8217;s in all the NWA records, <em>GTA* games and cop shows that you grow up with. There was something foreign yet familiar about it; watching Jay Jay successfully do the DUI test outside a servo was fucking hilarious. Once all the dust had settled, we managed to succeed in a mighty catharsis and finally released our *<a href="http://fallopiantunes.bandcamp.com/album/syrup">Syrup</a></em> EP into the ether.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Mexico City  </h2>
<p>Mexico immediately had a different feel; no fingerprints or retina scans or TSA arseholery. Just a friendly customs agent who smiled at us like we we&#8217;re some gringos who were there for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal">Mezcal</a>, oversized sombreros and devil&#8217;s dandruff (she knew&#8230;). We were greeted at the airport by Mexico City&#8217;s #1 live coding techno specialist and Fallopian Tunes? Central American Ambassador, <a href="http://fallopiantunes.com/smell-in-stereo/">Jorge Ramirez</a>. He had it all sorted for us: a banging studio apartment in Condesa, two great shows (one at an independent cinema, the other at an after-party for the Zona Maco Art Conference) and the local ceviche hook-up. It&#8217;s a good thing we didn&#8217;t have to resort to Mexico freestyling.</p>

<p>The first gig at Cine Tonala was a very classy affair. A sit-down crowd at an independent cinema with <a href="http://youtu.be/ppJ7UQHeOKg">full-screen digital visuals</a> courtesy of Mexican sound and visual artist, Roy ?Donde La Hierba? Chilango (a.k.a. <a href="http://vimeo.com/58572251">Ab/Dx</a>). Jorge Ramirez supported us that night under the new moniker <a href="http://fallopiantunes.com/smells-in-your-stereo-2/">Smell in Stereo</a>. This was our introduction to Mexico City&#8217;s thriving experimental electronic scene.</p>

<p>Later that night we we&#8217;re introduced to Patrick Miller. Old mate Patrick actually turned out to be a club which housed some of the most ?uniquely Mexican? music you can imagine: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-NRG">Hi&#8217;NRG</a>. The dancefloor of this place was covered with massive dance circles with two to eight dancers in each and it was on for young and old, literally. Buffed-up amigos in their 50s showing the teenie boppers how to pump and thrust, gothic vampires busting out slow-mo breakdance, all of it! The full cross-section of society. The best thing about Patty Miller was the total lack of inhibition. People were pulling out all kinds of moves and shapes (Aztec ballet, techno heart pumps). It was fucking liberating &#8211; no way would people get down in Melbourne like that unless it was filled with ironic undertones.</p>

<p>Our next show wasn&#8217;t until the following weekend. We had jams with the comical Tito, went and visited some Aztec ruins and had many a night sippin? down sweet Agave in between. The final gig was an after party for Zona Maco. This time the gig was in a Mezcal museum in a plaza full of mariachis that you hire to sing love songs. Weird setting, but something we were kinda used to at that point. It turned out to be the best gig of the tour. Tequila and Mezcal was flowing all night and we had 200 Mexicans boppin? and stoppin? to our set, calling out ?UNO MAS? even when we hadn&#8217;t a track left to play. To top things off, we witnessed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=PPJb9LjwQ0s">Mico Rex</a>. The love child of Jorge and Tito, it was the most insane, bizarre and amazing thing we&#8217;d ever experienced.</p>
<p>The tour was finished. We had a two-week holiday travelling round southern Mexico, getting spiritual at Mayan ruins, jungle tropics, canyons, waterfalls and the Caribbean. Then we flew back to LA and home again.</p>

<p>It was the way to do it, all organised off our own backs. Loose arrangements everywhere we went, making shit up on the fly. Big props to our Fallopian Papa Slatz for have the foresight to push us to do this and spearheading the operation and to all the other Fallopian Tunes crew who put in their hours to make this tour go down. Also, to all our gracious hosts, who put up with seven raw dingos for as long as they could stand.</p>
