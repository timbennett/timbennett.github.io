                <h3>Dew Process? latest signing Ernest Ellis wants to write albums like ?Nebraska? and have the kind of career enjoyed by the likes of Tom Waits and Nick Cave. But who is he? <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> finds out.
</h3>

Talk about meteoric. A little over a year ago 25-year-old Sydney musician Ernest Ellis (real name Roland) was more or less a figment of his own imagination, writing songs to cure the blues in his family&#8217;s cabin in The Blue Mountains. He&#8217;s since fleshed out those tracks into a debut album, <em>Hunting</em>; signed to Dew Process; and is scheduled to perform at Splendour in the Grass ahead of dates with UK pop sensations Florence and the Machine.</p>
<p>On the phone from Newtown &#8211; where he lives and works as a musician in between shifts at the local bottle-o &#8211; Ellis speaks matter-of-factly about his past, his love for Springsteen&#8217;s <em>Nebraska</em> and his decision to write music under a pseudonym. But what he lacks in charisma, he certainly makes up for in ambition. ?I want to get to a point where we can have a live show that&#8217;s like The Flaming Lips,? he explains. ?Somewhere between that and The Bad Seeds.?</p>
<p><strong>So is it Roland or Ernest?</strong><br/>
Probably Roland. It&#8217;s my real name I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Ernest Ellis?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve been making music for a couple of years, as Ernest Ellis for probably a year and a bit. It&#8217;s pretty much all I like to do. It&#8217;s hard to describe who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Have you been in other bands before?</strong><br/>
No, not really. Just high school bands and stuff like that, but I think I&#8217;m too much of a control freak to have too many cooks in the kitchen when writing songs.</p>
<p><strong>So I&#8217;m assuming your band is OK with you calling the shots?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I guess it works like that. It&#8217;s not a dictatorship or anything, but I write the songs and my band &#8211; Mat [Gardner, drums], Ben [Morgan, bass] and Keita [Tarlinton, keys] and Tim, my co-producer &#8211; fleshes them out to be played live and recorded as such.</p>
<p><strong>Why the pseudonym?</strong><br/>
Well, Ernest is my middle name. It&#8217;s weird, but I didn&#8217;t want to use my first and last name. It&#8217;s something that I didn&#8217;t think about too much. It&#8217;s my great-grandfather&#8217;s name and it&#8217;s been passed down. It&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s middle name as well.</p>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s not an adjective?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] No, definitely not. Well, I guess I make earnest music &#8211; but it&#8217;s not about me getting on my high horse about morality or anything.</p>
<p><strong>The album sounds really fully formed. How long have you been writing it for?</strong><br/>
Those songs have been written over a period of about a year all up. Half of the record was written in two months. I went up to The Blue Mountains [in NSW] to a house owned by my grandparents and recorded some stuff there. I went away to try and write a record that represented a sense of continuity. I guess I&#8217;d been listening to and reading how Bruce Springsteen wrote <em>Nebraska</em>, and I wanted to do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>So it&#8217;s not your <em>Tunnel of Love</em> [Springsteen&#8217;s 1987 break-up album]?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs*] What a fucking piece of shit that is! You gotta love The Boss, but *Tunnel of Love</em>? I&#8217;m not feeling that at all.</p>
<p><strong>I brought it up because the press release says you were going through some personal issues. I thought there might&#8217;ve been a break-up?</strong><br/>
No, nothing specific like that. To be honest, it was just dealing with the ?perks? of depression. Nothing really specific, just a lopsided brain, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>In that sense was writing the album a cathartic experience?</strong><br/>
Writing music really is that for me. Without bullshitting or trying to romanticise anything, music is far and away my favourite thing to do, and I don&#8217;t really know how to do anything else properly. In that sense it&#8217;s really cathartic. It makes me feel good about what&#8217;s happening, what&#8217;s coming out.</p>
<p><strong>Did you write most of the album up in The Blue Mountains?</strong><br/>
I recorded about half to three-quarters in The Blue Mountains, and then a couple of other songs (?Loveless?, ?Won&#8217;t Grow?) came after that period. Most of that record was written and then I had more time, which is never a good thing to give me. The label were really good about letting me go and record more and more and more stuff. It got to the point where we had three records and I had to cull it down. It was like killing your kids. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Will we see those songs on future releases?</strong><br/>
Yeah, totally &#8211; We&#8217;re going to do a thing where we send out a B-side every month to people that subscribe to the mailout. At the end of the year, if there&#8217;s enough interest, people will be able to buy those B-sides as a full record on vinyl. It&#8217;s a shame to let songs go to waste.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Without bullshitting or trying to romanticise anything, music is far and away my favourite thing to do, and I don&#8217;t really know how to do anything else properly.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How much did The Blue Mountains influence this record?</strong><br/>
So much. We actually recorded the bass and the drums out in Orange on my co-producer Tim Carr&#8217;s parents? farm. They were really kind to let us use that for almost a month. We recorded drums in this big warehouse that was surrounded by huge open spaces that remind me of <em>[The Assassination of] Jesse James [by the Coward Robert Ford]* or something like that. It was the same with The Blue Mountains. They&#8217;re very remote areas and it, in turn, contributed to the record&#8217;s sound. It wasn&#8217;t intentional that we had something that sounded like a soundtrack to a landscape, but it just sort of came out that way. That&#8217;s why the record&#8217;s called *Hunting</em>, I guess. It just seemed like an apt title when thinking about how the songs were recorded and how the songs sounded as a piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>Were you searching for something as well?</strong><br/>
I wouldn&#8217;t go that far. <em>Hunting</em> wasn&#8217;t mean to be taken so literally. It was just a cool word that somehow seemed to sum it [the recording experience] up for me, so I went down that road.</p>
<p><strong>Were you writing the album in isolation in The Blue Mountains? Or was Tim there during those sessions?</strong><br/>
That was just me for about three weeks, and then Tim came in during the last week and we recorded demos of the songs. We came back to Sydney and took them to the band. They became fully formed: the drums, the bass, whatever. That&#8217;s how it came to be really.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a bit more about Tim.</strong><br/>
He&#8217;s a very small bearded man, kind of like an Ewok. He&#8217;s a difficult character, a standoffish character, but somehow Tim and I found a middle ground where we could work together. We work together still and we&#8217;ll continue to work together. He&#8217;s very good at facilitating what I want to do. I have a tendency to listen to things a million times and slave over small mundane things. He&#8217;s able to deal with me and my impatience. That&#8217;s how we work together. I personally think he&#8217;s the best producer I&#8217;ve worked with. </p>
<p><strong>What else has he done?</strong><br/>
He&#8217;s done some work with Talons and Regular John &#8211; He&#8217;s done heaps of stuff. He&#8217;s sound engineered for Jay-Z and is one of the head engineers at 301 [Studios in Sydney].</p>
<p><strong>How did you meet up with him?</strong><br/>
Tim and I met at Studio 301. I was working with a producer that I wasn&#8217;t getting along with. Tim said, ?We could do it this way better.?  We went away and recorded some demos and I really enjoyed working with him. That was maybe a year-and-a-half, two years ago now.</p>
<p><strong>When did your other bandmates come onboard?</strong><br/>
They came into the frame as my band a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the <em>Nebraska</em> influence, but I&#8217;m hearing a strong TV on the Radio and The National vibe as well. Were you going for that dark, brooding sound?</strong><br/>
I wanted to make songs that were, for lack of a better word, thematically dark. I wanted to make them with a real pop sensibility like Elliott Smith did. So the records I was listening to were things like Animal Collective&#8217;s <em>Merriweather Post Pavillion*, all of TV on the Radio&#8217;s records, Neil Young&#8217;s *On The Beach*, Bob Dylan&#8217;s *Blood on the Tracks* and, of course, *Nebraska</em>.</p>
<p><strong>You mean <em>Nebraska</em> in terms of that whole ?artist in isolation? thing?</strong><br/>
Yeah, that sort of thing. Reading about The Boss writing that record was really interesting to me. It&#8217;s an amazing album. Lyrically, it&#8217;s brilliant. I focus massively on lyrics, so I connected with that album on that level.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s quite a dark album lyrically. Was that reflection of your state of mind at the time?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not a religious young chap, but I ended up singing about God and death. That just naturally came out, so I&#8217;m not really sure what&#8217;s going on there. I never sit down and consciously write lyrics. I think they have to come from a subconscious place &#8211; If you sit down and try and think of a line that rhymes with the line before it, then you&#8217;re bound to come out with a piece of shit. Lyrics for me are subconscious, and if I let a song live for too long without writing lyrics for it, then I&#8217;ll never get to it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you write lyrics first?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t really have a process. I generally have an idea and start recording it into GarageBand on my computer at home. I flesh it out from there. The melody always comes first and then I work out the lyrics from there.</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;d the deal with Dew Process come about?</strong><br/>
I wrote a song called ?Bad Blood? and I got an email from Greg Wales, a production guy at triple j, saying they wanted to play it. I got a call from Paul Piticco, who&#8217;s the head of Dew Process, asking if we wanted to sign with them. He&#8217;s been great to me &#8211; they all have been. That&#8217;s how simple it was really. It came about because he liked the songs. Working with them has been fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like quite a meteoric rise.</strong><br/>
A lot of people still haven&#8217;t heard of me, I guess. But they [Dew Process] have been a great label in terms of what they do and how they approach what I&#8217;m trying to do. It&#8217;s hard for me because I&#8217;m an introverted person who doesn&#8217;t like to deal with too many people. They&#8217;ve been very patient with me, understanding that the kind of career I want to have is like Nick Cave or Tom Waits.</p>

<p><em>Hunting</em> is out now through Dew Process. It&#8217;ll be launched at The Grand Hotel in Wollongong tomorrow (July 23).</p>
