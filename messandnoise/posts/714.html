                <h3>Currently living the dream in Los Angeles, Jonti Danilewitz &#8211; the artist formerly known as Danimals/Djanimals &#8211; talks to <strong>TIM SCOTT</strong> about Stones Throw Records, hanging out with Odd Future and using a foreign accent to his advantage.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024551/440x550-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Cliched as it may sound, Jonti is living the dream. His debut album <em>Twirligig</em> has just been released on his favourite label Stones Throw (Mistletone in Australia). He is currently based in Los Angeles where he&#8217;s been <a href="/news/4339136">recording</a> with Odd Future&#8217;s Hodgy Beats, meeting idols such as Madlib and hanging out at Flying Lotus&#8217; place. ?uestlove tweets about him. It&#8217;s a situation that the multi-instrumentalist, arranger, producer and vocalist explains, in a very LA way, as one that he&#8217;s ?still trying to process?.</p>
<p>Flash back to 2008, and Jonti Danilewitz is a shy, awkward South African-born teenager playing in Sydney indie band <a href="/releases/2000409">Sherlock&#8217;s Daughter</a>. He started recording and putting out wonky and broken beats as Danimals, playing live first with just a 404, and then as a band. Mark Ronson picked him out of a competition and next he&#8217;s recording music for a beer company. Then he&#8217;s changing his name for a <a href="/news/4098114">yoghurt multinational</a>.</p>
<p>He continued to work on various projects with Ronson, Santigold, Sean Lennon and the Dap-Kings, as well as producer John Agnello (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Kurt Vile). For <em>Twirligig</em> though, Jonti produced, arranged and recorded it all himself. A huge task, but one that left an impression on Stones Throw honcho Mr Peanut Butter Wolf himself, who had this to say about his music: ?I understand the pop references because his music is so catchy, but the arrangements blew me away. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how the hell he did what he did. That he did it all on his own at such an early age kinda scared me. I knew right away I needed to add him to the roster.?</p>
<p>I spoke to Jonti from Los Angeles on the day that he received the vinyl copies of <em>Twirligig</em>.</p>
<p><strong>How is LA treating you? What have you been up to?</strong><br/>
LA is fantastic. It&#8217;s surreal. I&#8217;ve been here for one month now and I&#8217;m still trying to process it all. I&#8217;ve been staying in Culver City, which is near West Hollywood, but I&#8217;ve been working at the Stones Throw offices. There is also a studio there, which I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in. It&#8217;s in a place called Highland Park, which is like a Mexican part, but they have their offices there.</p>
<p><strong>How are you finding the nature of celebrity in LA?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m still getting used to it. I&#8217;m originally from a smaller town in South Africa, so even coming to Sydney tripped me out to begin with when I was meeting all these cool musical people. But now coming to Los Angles, it&#8217;s just crazy. The other day I saw Elijah Wood, then I found out later that he&#8217;s a huge Stones Throw fan. Los Angles has such a massive hip-hop culture and history.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3024550/430x430-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Coming from South Africa via Sydney, do you find that intimidating?</strong><br/>
Well, yes and no. To tell you the truth, it still feels like a dream. All the music that I have been really interested in the past ever since I can remember has been LA stuff. Even as a child I liked stuff like the Beach Boys through to the Stones Throw catalogue and now the Low End Theory. It was all ever I&#8217;d ever think about. I love Odd Future stuff now too. I love the LA culture and I feel grateful to be part of it, just to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Plus awesome Mexican food! Do you have a favourite taco place?</strong><br/>
Oh my god, I&#8217;ve been eating it pretty much everyday! There is a place in Echo Park that I go to a lot and I&#8217;ve discovered these horchata drinks, which are Mexican rice drinks that are really good.</p>
<p><strong>Have you been to any of the Low End Theory nights? Are they still going?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been every week since I&#8217;ve been here. [<em>Laughs</em>] There&#8217;s a thing here called the Eagle Rock Music Festival which just happened, and Low End Theory had a stage where Teebs, Flying Lotus and Matthew David played. It&#8217;s their five-year anniversary next week as well, they&#8217;re going to be having a lot of big nights. Last week they had Amon Tobin, and one week it was James Blake and Flying Lotus and all these guys. And last night there was a hardcore band playing as well. There is a great community around it.</p>
<p><strong>What is the reaction when they find out you that are you from South Africa via Sydney?</strong><br/>
Yeah it&#8217;s definitely the same in the United States as it is in Australia. I definitely play the South African card with girls more. [<em>Laughs</em>]. But once they find out you are a foreigner it definitely adds a bit of curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>What was your initial reaction to getting signed to Stones Throw?</strong><br/>
I still can&#8217;t believe it. It was a dream. They have legacy that is amazing. Even today I got the hard copy of the vinyl and just to think that two years ago from when I made the record in my bedroom I never dreamt that I would be putting it out on Stones Throw.</p>
<p><strong>It must be a thrill to see the Stones Throw logo on the record knowing that it&#8217;s the same logo that was on J Dilla records&#8230;</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s crazy. I mean the other day J Dilla&#8217;s brother Illa J was in the studio, and we hit if off. We were recording and he talks the same as Dilla, and it was really tripping me out. [<em>Laughs</em>] It&#8217;s weird, and Madlibs studio is across the street and he is awesome. If I could do stuff with anyone in the world it would be Madlib. He said that he had heard my stuff on the radio and liked it.</p>
<p><strong>The new song up on your Soundcloud ?Love Guitar? is quite different to the album.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it&#8217;s a new track. It&#8217;s an instrumental that I wanted to put up. I was trying to make something that sounded like two guitars in a relationship, with me in the middle. I don&#8217;t know. It seems pretty silly now that I just said it out loud. [<em>Laughs</em>] It was just an experiment and I thought it sounded nice, so I wanted to put it up on Soundcloud.</p>

<p><strong>I read a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonti_danimals">Twitter</a> post earlier this week that said ?terrible news/great news/unfortunate news/exciting news?. Is that an average day for you nowadays?</strong><br/>
Yes. [<em>Laughs</em>] Today, for example, I started off by getting pulled over by a cop at 3am when I was coming home from the studio, and he found out that I didn&#8217;t have a Californian driver&#8217;s licence. He put me in this weird position where he made me park in a tow-away zone and then said, ?You have until 6am to find an American driver to remove your car.? It was awful. I hadn&#8217;t even made it a block from the studio before they pulled me over. Then I go from that to later in the day, when I get the LP version of the album and get to meet Madlib. That part was awesome. Then I have my own studio where I can make my own beats, which is like a dream come true. So yeah, everything is really up and down and surreal!</p>
<p><strong>Is that the same studio that you recorded with Hodgy Beats to do the ?Nagoya? track?</strong><br/>
I made the beat there. I went to his studio to make his vocals and my vocals.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s he and the Odd Future crew like to hang out with? Do you just hang out front of the Supreme store on Fairfax?</strong><br/>
Totally they hang out there. They are on tour now but when I was in studio with Hodgy, Tony Yayo from G-Unit dropped by. It was weird I was doing my vocal part and I look up at the booth and I&#8217;m like, ?Oh, there&#8217;s Tony Yayo? [<em>Laughs</em>]. But Hodgy is really humble and cool. They all have a million projects but they&#8217;re all into talking about music and stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Everyone is just dancing. There&#8217;s no one standing there with their arms folded saying, ?Oh, it&#8217;s not live.??</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A new album means more touring, including <a href="/news/4345305">Laneway festival</a> next year. Is this something that you are excited about? How is your live show?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m looking forward to it. To me it&#8217;s a whole process. Playing live is not something I really intended to do when I first started, but now I&#8217;ve kind of figured it out and it&#8217;s been really fun recently. A lot is changing. I started this long before people like Flying Lotus were big in Australia, but now I find the whole electronic scene very inspiring, and the community around Astral People and those artists there is very supportive. Even a lot of the people involved in the Low End Theory, they have a little [Roland] SP-404 sampler and they just DJ and mess with beats and have everyone enjoying themselves and dancing. Everyone is just dancing. There&#8217;s no one standing there with their arms folded saying, ?Oh, it&#8217;s not live.? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>What about the video for ?Firework Spraying Moon? with Henry DeMaio? He seems to be the Stones Throw in-house video dude, having worked with Mayer Hawthorne, D&#8217;m-FunK&#8230;</strong><br/>
I was just at his house. I&#8217;ve been staying on his couch! He is a really cool guy. He was one of the first people I met when I got here, and I&#8217;ve been staying on his couch pretty much ever since. He has this night called Funkmosphere every Monday night and just hangs out with funk DJs including D&#8217;m-FunK. I met him there. We ended up making the video. I can&#8217;t remember how, but we just decided we wanted to do a video for that song. He had an idea involving chemicals and mirrors, which I really liked, and that&#8217;s how he created a lot of the effects.</p>

<p><strong>Your ?Sine &amp; Moon? mix went up on the Stones Throw <a href="http://stonesthrow.com/podcast/">podcast</a>. That must be a great way to reach a bigger audience&#8230;</strong><br/>
Totally. That was really the first mix I made before <em>Twirligig*. It was one of those albums in my personal discography and it was probably the most recent one before *Twirligig</em>. And this is a mix based around most of those songs.</p>

<p>####?Twirligig? is out now on Mistletone/Inertia. Jonti will be performing at the St Jerome&#8217;s Laneway Festival in January.</p>
