                <h3>Jokes, arguments, &#8216;Jesus Christ Superstar&#8217; singalongs and more roadkill than a redneck&#8217;s dinner. Dead Letter Chorus hit the road in November to launch their new album, &#8216;The August Magnificent&#8217;.
</h3>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day one</h2>
<p><strong>The Annandale Hotel, Sydney</strong></p>
<p>The beginning of <em>The August Magnificent</em> tour. It seems weird that this day has finally come. We&#8217;ve spent so much time working away at the recording and production of this album that playing live and touring was actually one of the last things on our minds. Now that the day is here, we are collectively excited and worried all at once. Playing shows, drinking, lugging gear around, driving for entire days crammed in a station wagon, getting little to no sleep, living on top of each other, drinking &#8230; the life of a touring musician is indeed a glamorous one.  </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3001796/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="400"/>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s performance is to a hometown crowd at the Annandale. We&#8217;re happy to be here first. The home-field advantage helps calm the nerves for the shows to come. We arrived in the afternoon full of energy and dying to get onstage. And after a ridiculously slow moving and annoying sound check, we finally felt ready to sit back and wait for the night to begin. The support bands &#8211; Jordy Lane, Wifey and Green Mohair Suits &#8211; were great. We picked them personally because we love their music. Unfortunately the hectic vibe of the night kept us secluded upstairs for the majority of the evening. </p>
<p>We took the stage to a packed room. It still feels weird when people clap when you walk onstage, like they are showing appreciation for something you haven&#8217;t actually done yet. Despite some slight sound issues and the fact that we were louder than Slipknot for the entire set, we gave it our absolute all, played as if our lives depended on it and stumbled offstage sweaty and completely drained. The crowd seemed to like it and the call for an encore was answered.  </p>
<p>The night ended with tonnes of old friends and new fans buying the record and having a quick chat. Unfortunately all we could think about was getting in the car the next morning at 7am to drive to Melbourne. </p>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day two</h2>
<p><strong>Northcote Social Club, Melbourne</strong></p>
<p>The hour of sleep that everyone in the band was able to fit in last night finds everyone in surprisingly good spirits this morning. Talk of the gig last night and who we bumped into afterwards keeps everyone laughing. </p>
<p>We immediately hit our first bump in the road and we haven&#8217;t even jumped in the car yet. The car cannot fit all our gear. When you tour in a band and you&#8217;re not all over <em>Video Hits* or something, gear is an issue. We just simply don&#8217;t have the space or money to travel with a full drum kit and amps. So the majority of the time, guitars and keyboards are the bulk of our travelling gear. Add to that leads, tambourines, cymbals, a snare, drumsticks, merch and personal clothing and you can see how the back of the car can get mighty cramped. We are lucky that Cameron spent the greater part of his misspent youth playing *Tetris</em> and he manages to cram all that shit into the back of a station wagon. The drive goes faster every time you head to Melbourne and it was definitely quicker this time. We were driving through the streets of Melbourne city in no time.  </p>
<p>Tonight we support American Howe Gelb from Giant Sand fame, whose crowd were predominantly old-school country-folk connoisseurs. This man is interesting to say the least. Speaking to him is equally inspiring and daunting. We sat upstairs and explained the rules of Rugby League to him which were greeted with the confused looks of a foreigner.</p>
<p>We were extremely tired from the night before and the drive, so we smoothly rolled into our set. We have two modes in this band: bourbon and red wine. The Annandale was dirty bourbon, but tonight was the finest of red wines. We sat back and let the songs play themselves which felt great. Howe serenaded a floor seated crowd for a good amount of time. The staff at the Northcote Social Club were extremely nice and basically refused to let us pay for a drink which, in turn, made us drink a lot.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a band in Melbourne that you absolutely have to see. A band called Wagons. Not only are they an amazing band but they are the nicest people around. Henry Wagons graciously gave up his loungeroom and home studio for us all to crash in. The night ended with us heading back to Henry&#8217;s for a good night&#8217;s sleep &#8230; well, almost all of us.</p>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day three</h2>
<p><strong>The Northcote Social Club, Melbourne (Cup Eve)</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so Henry has this dog named Peeps. This dog is insane. It completely freaks out about everything. Every event is huge in Peeps? life. He&#8217;s just so stressed. We spent the good part of the morning playing with him and watching him freak out. Wagons manager and good friend of ours Matt Kennedy came round to start the wind up to the big gig that night. We love playing with Wagons because of the guys in the band and the great audience they have. We all clink glasses later that afternoon when we hear that the gig had sold out before we&#8217;d even left the house. It was a bizarrely exciting feeling. We all headed to the Northcote once again to start the set-up process. </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3001797/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="400"/>
<blockquote><p>We perused op-shops for T-shirts with wolves on the front, drank in coffee shops, replaced four tyres on the car and were part of an evacuation in a major shopping centre.</p></blockquote>
<p>Claire Hollingsworth opened the night solo. A lovely girl that we made friends with that night. We opened to a rapidly filling room. A lot more energy compared to last night because of actually getting a little more sleep. We played our hearts out and once again walked offstage giving our all.</p>
<p>We thought we were all cool and brooding for about 10 minutes until The Wayfaring Strangers walked onstage. This band from the wetlands barely ever play and are a huge inspiration to Wagons. So much so that Wagons still play a cover of their song ?Willy Nelson? at almost every gig. When performing this song themselves they drag Henry Wagons onstage and lead singer Dom berates a kneeling Henry for stealing their song. They then perform a song in which Dom precedes to scream about an angry cat while making the mic feedback to annoy the crowd. This band is mental.</p>
<p>Wagons were their usual fine selves and had our entire band singing along. The night ended extremely drunkenly with the greatest sing-along we&#8217;ve ever been a part of when our guitarist Michael led the entire bar in a rendition of ?For The Longest Time? by Billy Joel. He was almost crash tackled off a bar stool by two very large bouncers. We then knew it was time to head home.</p>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day four and five</h2>
<p><strong>Hanging out in Melbourne</strong></p>
<p>Our hangovers were so rough that we missed the damn horse race! Not that we were that keen on seeing it, but when in Rome &#8211; Cameron awoke to having no voice at all; a slight problem but we&#8217;ve got two days to get it back. Henry gave us a full run-down on his new passion: coffee. He also began recording a version of ?Bad To The Bone? for a new film that we got a sneak preview of.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee, Michael and Andrew relocated to Wagons multi-instrumentalist Mark&#8217;s house. He lives with an amazing musician and old Sydney friend Chad Mason. It was great to catch up with him. Later, we perused op-shops for T-shirts with wolves on the front, drank in coffee shops, replaced four tyres on the car and were part of an evacuation in a major shopping centre. Michael had his FIRST EVER CUP OF TEA and also became obsessed with the show <em>Deadwood</em>, Gabby bought two pairs of shoes and Lee saw his family. Normal day-off stuff. </p>
<p>We had dinner at two different pubs over two days. The first was The Fox. We were served by the rudest staff, ate the best food and completely fell in love with this band called Jelly Tub Rollers, a band of young white kids who dressed and played like they were straight out of an early Ray Charles clip. The second was a pub called The Retreat. Simply nothing like it in Sydney &#8211; the burgers were so big we nearly exploded. </p>
<p>The days of rest were well needed after such a hectic start and set us up perfectly for the day to follow. </p>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day six</h2>
<p><strong>The Old Bar, Melbourne</strong></p>
<p>We find out this morning that we have scored a support slot with one of our favourite Australian bands, The Panics, at The Metro in Sydney. This is great news. We then thanked our dear friends in Wagons with the cheapest bottles of wine and said a sad goodbye to the <em>Deadwood</em> DVDs. </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3001798/640x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="400"/>
<p>Our last gig in Melbourne, and the venue we were supposed to play failed to get the correct licenses in time. It baffled us to no end. The mix-up, however, turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we relocated to The Old Bar, a lovely little pub much like our beloved Hopetoun Hotel back in Sydney. Dirty, but wreaking of character. We buddied up with the bar staff and basically did our own sound onstage as there was a limited PA. </p>
<p>Vibes were relaxed yet positive. Seagull played the best set of the tour bar none. Fucking incredible. We all hope to play with them again. A beautiful crowd clapped us onstage which we&#8217;re still working on understanding. We played a pretty different set, mixing up the song order completely which made it really interesting for us to play. The crowd never dropped attention, was very quiet and polite and surprisingly laughed at all our lame jokes. We decided that we would grade the success of the night by the fact the pierced-up, tattooed, black-haired rocker chick that worked behind the bar came up and bought our record before she signed off. A quick drink with our dear friend Milan and we were back in the car to head to Werribee, which we were later told houses the sewage for all of Melbourne. Awesome. We hope to get four or five hours sleep before the big drive tomorrow. Radelaide here we come!  </p>
<h2 style="margin:0;">Day seven</h2>
<p><strong>Jive, Adelaide</strong></p>
<p>The day started bad. Lee had lost his iPod as well as his new tambourine and was taking it out on the road. After not being able to do the legal speed for a good hour we decided it was time for someone else to drive. Then came rain. It didn&#8217;t stop until we hit Bordertown which, funnily enough, is a town on the border.</p>
<p>We hit up the supermarket and spent a while going through the local sell-and-swap noticeboards finding many interesting and rare products. On our shopping list were four things: bread, cheese, ham and tomato. We had planned to make use of the rare sunshine and headed to the park. As soon as we sat down it began to rain so we headed to the car. Each person had their own job. Lee was on bread, Michael was on cheese, Gabby was on ham, Rose was vainly trying to cut tomatoes with a plastic knife on top of a laptop (is this covered by Dell&#8217;s warranty?) and Cameron was on presentation. If we didn&#8217;t play in a band, we are all certain we could be great factory production-line workers. </p>

<p>We made it to Jive in the late afternoon, still arguing about the time zone difference and loaded into the venue. It smelt bad to say the least, but the people were so nice and they burnt some incense which made the whole place smell amazing. After sound check we headed back to the car where we noticed a parking fine. Before looking at it we were a little distressed. A touring band just doesn&#8217;t have a lot of money floating around, and this could really hurt us. We open it to find the whole sum of $33. Not only that, we have six weeks to pay it. We debated leaving the car there for the whole night. This was relatively cheap secure parking compared to the rates in Sydney.</p>
<p>We play the gig and it feels great all round. We are really getting used to playing the new songs. We thank the Huckleberry Swedes for being awesome and lending us all their gear and retire to a backpackers up the road. Classy.</p>

<p><strong>More travelling and Wagga Wagga</strong></p>
<p>The drive from Adelaide to Wagga is pretty much the most boring thing you could ever experience. But if you have to do it with five people, they may as well be your best friends. Jokes, arguments, singalongs, iPod wars, Farmer&#8217;s Union iced coffee, <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> recitals, roadkill after roadkill. We had it all. Then things started to get a lot darker. After 10 hours of straight flat road, no one was talking to each other unless they were pointing out someone else&#8217;s mistake. Everyone wanted to kill each other. However, it only took one toot of the horn at some unsuspecting cows on the side of the road to restore laughter to the car. It also helped that we were only 20 minutes away from our rest stop for the night.  </p>

<p>We get to our caravan park and load into our cabin. Then it beings. Four pizzas, one case of beer, one bottle of white wine, one game of Uno. One of the most fun and memorable nights of the tour. Michael tried to cheat in the first round. We drink, laugh and dare each other to do stupid juvenile things and sleep like babies for the first time in a week.</p>

<p><strong>Home</strong></p>
<p>We get up. Go to a cafe. Drive home. Hug each other. Blog. Sleep.</p>
