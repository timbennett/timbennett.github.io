                <h3>Small town idiosyncrasies, nightmarish tales of haunted lovers and a swampy bayou dirge &#8211; <strong>JOE DRIVER<em>*, **LAUREN CREW**, **LIAM JUDSON** and *</em>AIDAN ROBERTS</strong> from Belles Will Ring lead us through their second full-length album, &#8216;Crystal Theatre&#8217;. For a limited time, the album is available for preview below.
</h3>
<h2>?Crystal Theatre?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020642/440x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Liam: Named after the old theatre/cinema in the NSW country town of Portland where we recorded a great portion of the record, this is a short moment of peace and sweetness before we get down to the heart of the matter. There is a full version of this song that is being recorded at the very time of this writing.</p>
<p>Aidan: This was the last thing recorded for the album, Liam always conceived of it to be a hint of things to come, eventually a longer song in its own right. It kind of opens up the doors to the theatre.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Come To The Village?</h2>
<p>Aidan: This was always planned as the opening of the record, the first mile of the journey, the voices and hypnotic rhythm of the bass being like the thrumming of car wheels on the increasingly rough bitumen, the further you get from civilisation. Who knows what or where this village is, maybe it&#8217;s Deepwater?</p>
<p>Liam: This song opens with what sounds like a dirty old factory grinding away in the distance &#8211; inspired by the menacing &#8220;music&#8221; that opens <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>.</p>
<p>Lauren: Long hazy days watching the town play out its routines. Every town has a story no matter how small but mostly you&#8217;ll only hear it in whispers.</p>
<p>Joe: We put the drums down on Australia Day 2010, saturated in sweat head to toe, half wondering if the tinderbox bushland behind Lauren&#8217;s mum&#8217;s house was gonna self ignite, half certain it would. The outro feels like some kind of bittersweet reward.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Trouble In Deepwater?</h2>
<p>Liam: One of the earliest songs written for the album, The smouldering atmosphere and themes in ?Deepwater? paved the way for much of the album&#8217;s direction. I particularly like the guitar interplay and Lauren&#8217;s haunting flute on this one.</p>
<p>Aidan: I see this song as Liam&#8217;s way of painting a romantic fantasy about those troubling idiosyncrasies of small towns. There&#8217;s a place called Deepwater on the New England Highway, my only visual memories of it are a run-down movie theatre and a playground with flaked old plastic ride-on animals. </p>
<p>Joe: I&#8217;ve heard the others talk about the sadness this song sometimes conjures up and lyrically, I bet this girl&#8217;s parents aren&#8217;t getting much sleep. Sonically though, I get a kick from the uplifting melody and exultant, anthemic choruses.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Street Lamp Stomp?</h2>
<p>Aidan: This song came out of nowhere while I was making demos for this record. I was in a particularly minimalist mood, and wanted to try to write a song with one chord. I originally sampled a jungle stomp beat from Harry Connick Jr&#8217;s trio, and just carved out this dirty jump-step guitar line for it. Then I imagined Simon and Garfunkel singing over the top of it, and that&#8217;s more or less where we took it.</p>
<p>Liam: Baritone guitars and screaming harmonica &#8211; this is kinda our swampy bayou dirge.</p>
<p>Lauren: This is the ghost train from your dreams. That isn&#8217;t maracas you hear &#8211; it&#8217;s the rattle of a thousand dancing skeletons!</p>
<p/>
<h2>?I Hear Your Voice On The Wind?</h2>
<p>Aidan: Another nightmarish tale of haunted lovers and revenge tactics from Liam. Kind of like his &#8216;Big Iron&#8217;. I can&#8217;t imagine the headspace Liam was in when he did the vocals for this &#8211; it must have been a hell of a night, one finger always on the tape delay send. The yelps are truly terrifying here.</p>
<p>Liam: It&#8217;s written from the point of view of a heartbroken soul. He&#8217;s clearly messed up. Thematically it&#8217;s related to ?Deepwater?, and it was recorded on a very windy night in early spring. The singing was particularly challenging on this song &#8211; it had to be right, I freaked myself out.</p>
<p>Joe: Someone shut the door! Get him out of here!</p>
<p>Lauren: I adore the harmonies of the voice on the wind. I enjoyed the recording session &#8211; singing like a haunting memory on repeat.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Like A Boxer?</h2>
<p>Aidan: I wrote this originally as a two-minute mini-song, to be quietly inserted into a dark corner of the record. But as we worked on the song for the live shows, we realised it had more in it than that. Recorded out at the Oberon house at about 3am, you can almost hear the guitar falling asleep. I get taken to another world when the flute comes in at the end. We had Tom Waits dialogue samples from a Jim Jarmusch film on the original demo; wish we could&#8217;ve stolen those. But in the end I found this late night talk show on the shortwave radio which seemed to fit the mood.</p>
<p>Liam: I remember recording this late one night at the walnut farm near Oberon, where we recorded a bunch of the record. It was our second attempt and we were getting kinda worked up. Aidan and Joe were playing together for the basic track and I was manning the recording. All of a sudden they nailed it and when we listened back, furrowed brows slowly turned to smiles and we all went &#8220;oh yeeeeaaaaahhhhhh&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lauren: We recorded the flute outro twice for this song. I was so happy with the first but there was an issue with the recording and we had to do it again. Thankfully we did because the second version was far less planned and has so many strange and wonderful moments.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Do You Know What I See??</h2>
<p>Liam: This song started life many moons ago as a swinging, jaunty thing &#8211; probably inspired by Simon and Garfunkel and would have sat comfortably on <em>Mood Patterns</em>, our first album. Fast forward a few years and I&#8217;m dreaming up a vibe for a song that I could hear 12-string electrics, echoey guitars and a melancholic, but slightly detached tune. Instead of starting from scratch, I jokingly grabbed this old song and used and abused it until it barely resembled the original. It worked! Now it&#8217;s one of my favourites.</p>
<p>Joe: This song had a few incarnations indeed, at one point disappearing from our thoughts altogether until it resurfaced for a drink in a sleazy club frequented by shady characters from a cold war spy novel set in Krakow. The characters at the centre of the story are unchanged but their soundtrack sounds a little more investigatory now perhaps. </p>
<p>Aidan: Probably the most recognizably Belles Will Ring moment on the record, for me. It felt instantly familiar when Liam first showed it to us &#8211; that descending 12-string part, and the cruise-control outro vocals. This song was recorded so many times I hardly even remember where it began, now it seems like it&#8217;s always been a part of the set.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Come North With Me Baby, Wow?</h2>
<p>Lauren: Melting horizons and the promise of alcohol.</p>
<p>Liam: Initially we were going for a very LA sound for this song, with the Tijuana-style horns and twangy guitars. To our pleasant surprise, the final product ended up reminding us more of The Go-Betweens than say, Love. I, for some reason have a thing with driving north, and north in general. At a restaurant I will often try and sit facing north &#8211; I realise it&#8217;s strange.</p>
<p>Aidan: I am pretty sure Liam got the title of this song from an improvised studio quote from Dean Jones, &#8220;Oh tell me about it, baby, wow.&#8221; Here was the first chance we had to insert the American brass ensemble. Sounds like it&#8217;s been pulled from somewhere between San Francisco and Tijuana.</p>
<p>Joe: This required a leap of faith that befell us as a band, being the first thing we recorded after I moved over onto drums. I was hell bent on making sure it still sounded like the vintage Belles I loved. The guide track I played along to featured some vintage Judson mock-singing and alternate lyrics that meant my first few attempts disintegrated into fits of uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?The Green?</h2>
<p>Liam: The heart of the matter.</p>
<p>Lauren: Fading light of day. Don&#8217;t go out after dark.</p>
<p>Aidan: Liam&#8217;s dirge masterwork on the record. One of the late-night behemoths from the Oberon sessions, I remember hearing Joe and Liam jousting out the drums and guitar as I stood outside, the song echoing across 100 acres of walnut trees at night, bouncing back at me under the half-moon.</p>
<p>Joe: I threatened to punch Liam at three million o&#8217;clock one drunken night in Fortitude Valley when he told me he wanted to re-track ?The Green?. I think I only popped a button off his shirt in the end (sorry mate), but I think I was right in insisting we keep it. I remember thinking the air pressure was dropping in the room around us during that outro &#8230; a sensation that became positively cyclonic when we reconvened to track ?The River? later the same night.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Bald Mountain?</h2>
<p>Joe: It&#8217;s late and it&#8217;s near freezing out. This guy is handcuffed in the back of a Police car and his breath is fogging up the side window as he becomes hypnotised by the passing of those high hung phosphorus yellow lights that line the deserted freeway.</p>
<p>Aidan: About as close as we wanted to get to soul on the record. I wrote this as a response to ?Come to the Village?. In a way, it&#8217;s like you are driving far far away from the village, because of what had happened there. As the song progresses, you slowly shake off the heavy feeling.</p>
<p>Liam: Recorded the same night as ?Deepwater? in the Portland house. It&#8217;s a continuation of the cinematic imagery that we were crafting for our &#8220;dark road movie&#8221; which became this album.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?The River?</h2>
<p>Liam: No lie &#8211; the night in the walnut farm that we recorded this song was one of the eeriest of my life. It was late and we were loose! No one was aware this song existed, then I sprung it on them and we jumped on our instruments and after about five minutes of playing, someone yelled &#8220;roll tape!!!&#8221; The take was 40 minutes long and it broke down once in the middle with us laughing feverishly. By the end we were feeling psychotic. The song has a spaghetti western meets biker sound &#8211; we stumbled outside and in the sky was a gang of skulls in a perfect cloud formation and we were like, &#8220;Oh man, we summoned the ghost riders!&#8221;. The cover art by Sonny and Biddy [We Buy Your Kids] makes a reference to this.</p>
<p>Aidan: A maniacal jam, conceived by Liam as only a series of impressions and images in his mind over the course of several months, which he eventually demonstrated through his guitar one night in the country. We hastily set up the mikes and tore into it. One half-hour of time and space that I can still see and smell and hear as though it were yesterday.</p>
<p>Joe: The full story behind the creation of this, our &#8220;monsterpiece&#8221;, is too perfect, too unbelievable, for a few ill chosen words here. If you can imagine being on a runaway rollercoaster that passes through a forest of Hawaiian shirts, diner carparks full of angry, territorial hot-rodders while being pursued by a carriage of your musical contemporaries &#8211; then you&#8217;re some of the way there! Ask me in person for the full story sometime? This night, which started with ?The Green?, changed me.</p>
<p>Lauren: Somebody save us.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Redwood Hill?</h2>
<p>Liam: Aidan and Lauren sing together beautifully on this. Joe plays guitar. It was recorded on the last night in Portland, and I can still feel the mood of that night every time I hear the song &#8211; that strange feeling of something ending.</p>
<p>Lauren: Singing this song makes me feel curious and at peace.</p>
<p>Aidan: I really wanted to sing a song with Lauren, so I wrote this one for us to sing. It&#8217;s a song about a fallen movie star. I&#8217;ll never forget when we first laid down the acoustic guitars, very very late at night. I just taught it to Joe and we sat down and knocked it over in one sleepy take, everyone just kind of went silent for a while.</p>
<p>Joe: Playing this put me in a trance that quelled any hovering thoughts about getting the performance right, while the storytelling reminds me of Ray Carver.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Pallisade Alley?</h2>
<p>Aidan: This is the song for the next morning, it&#8217;s the end titles of the film. The wild percussion and the optimistic chord progression seemed like the right balance of uplifting and tense; in a way it&#8217;s the final statement of the journey we started with ?Come to the Village?.<br/>
Joe: If there is a happy ending for all the scary events in this album, ?Pallisade Alley? is where it happens. Roll credits.</p>
<p>Liam: This song returns a sense of hope after the ghostly, choral coda of ?Redwood Hill?. It makes me think of driving along the Bear Tooth Highway in Wyoming in the morning. Not a bad way to end.</p>
