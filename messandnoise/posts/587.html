                <h3>After 19 years fronting Magic Dirt, Adalita Srsen has emerged with a solo album of her own &#8211; but she&#8217;s had to endure her fair share of personal hardship in the process, writes <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>*. Photos by *</em>WARWICK BAKER</strong>.

?I&#8217;m not into this la-dee-da stuff,? jokes Adalita Srsen in an upstairs boardroom of Liberation Music&#8217;s South Melbourne office. This is her home now, among the memorabilia and gold records, the 50 Cent tour posters and the signed Sound Relief billboards. She&#8217;s even sitting at the same polished table where she put pen to paper on a deal with Liberation back in September. After self-releasing the last few Magic Dirt records, Srsen was courted by the Michael Gudinski-helmed label, who were so impressed by the early mixes of her eponymous solo debut, they approached her to put it out.</p>
<p>?[Liberation] come around the corner unexpectedly,? she explains. ?I wasn&#8217;t geared up for it at that point; it was so soon after the record was done. They put forward a very convincing argument as to why they wanted me, they seemed to understand where I was coming from, and it just felt right. I decided then and there.?</p>
<p>It takes little more than a cursory listen to <em>Adalita</em> to confirm why. Informed by the death of her ex-partner and Magic Dirt bandmate Dean Turner, the album is stark and uncompromising; a unique and clear artistic vision co-conceptualised with Turner before he died from a rare form of deep tissue cancer in 2009, aged 37. Srsen is still grappling with Turner&#8217;s death, but she&#8217;s turned tragedy into triumph, and exorcised some demons in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Did you contemplate putting the record out yourself?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I did, but I wasn&#8217;t sure whether anybody would be interested.</p>
<p><strong>Where did that apprehension come from?</strong><br/>
Dean used to always say, and various managers that we had, that I&#8217;m always negative, a little bit pessimistic. If I&#8217;m a little bit pessimistic, then it can only go up from there. [<em>Laughs</em>] Maybe it&#8217;s a safety net, or something like that. I guess apprehension because it is so different from Magic Dirt. In my mind I was like, ?This is going to be difficult to market?, because it&#8217;s pretty much just guitar and voice for most of the record. So I guess there was apprehension of that, and the unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Were you worried about [Magic Dirt] fans not coming across with you?</strong><br/>
Um, I think I was just doubtful. There&#8217;s always apprehension with any release I&#8217;ve done &#8211; even with Magic Dirt. ?What are people going to think??, particularly with the twists and turns Magic Dirt have taken with their recordings &#8211; It&#8217;s a natural part of the creative process, really. To have a little bit of doubt, that expectant moment, that intake of breath, that leap into the unknown. That&#8217;s very integral.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s a natural part of the creative process, really. To have a little bit of doubt, that expectant moment, that intake of breath, that leap into the unknown. That&#8217;s very integral.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The early response to ?Hot Air? must&#8217;ve been pretty pleasing given it&#8217;s pretty indicative of how the record sounds.</strong><br/>
Yeah, it was. I was rapt and taken aback really by the response. I was hoping it&#8217;d be good, but it was better than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Were you nervous about how people would react to the more personal themes on the record?</strong><br/>
No, no. I don&#8217;t really understand what people mean by personal and I&#8217;ve been getting that a lot with my solo record and also with Magic Dirt. I guess I don&#8217;t understand, because it seems like that&#8217;s just the way you should write. What other way can you write, aside from personally? I find it hard to comprehend what people mean.</p>
<p><strong>Well, I guess, there are a lot of people that can write from the perspective of a character.</strong><br/>
So a first-person kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, like Nick Cave.</strong><br/>
Right, right. OK. Well it&#8217;s not difficult for me at all [writing personally]. I find it really natural, really normal and I don&#8217;t give it a second thought. I think nerves come more from how the instrumentation is presented: have I produced it correctly and have I got the right sounds? I&#8217;m more nervous about that side. Once the lyrics are done, they&#8217;re done.</p>
<p><strong>I think some people would perceive it as quite a brave thing to do; to keep putting yourself out there.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s nice. I&#8217;m happy to be seen like that. I guess I&#8217;ve never really known any other way to write. I guess if I sit down and analyse it, I might freak myself out. I&#8217;m OK with it, because I don&#8217;t think that I expose my &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m doing it in a dangerous way. It feels quite constructive. It&#8217;s a positive process, exploring my psyche or reactions to the world &#8211; There are some darker aspects that are explored, but in a way they&#8217;re enlightened once they&#8217;re out there.</p>
<p><strong>Like a catharsis?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s more like a balm. Half the time when you have a problem, or issue going around in your head, once you verbalise it, half the problem&#8217;s gone &#8211; maybe even three-quarters. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s this toxic thing that comes out. I think it&#8217;s transformed into something else &#8211; This other thing that&#8217;s not so bad. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>I find it hard not to think about Dean when I hear this album.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s all about Dean for me and honouring our creative teamwork and his initial idea of me doing the solo thing. This is an extension of our relationship &#8211; he&#8217;s immortalised through it now, and in Magic Dirt and in everything that he did. The clips I&#8217;m making now, I just think about if Dean would be proud of them, what he&#8217;d say and what parts he&#8217;d love. It&#8217;s just relating it back to that part of me that&#8217;s connected to Dean, connected to our past together and our lives together, where we came from. So a lot of the shots I have in my clips come from where we grew up or that environment; that&#8217;s kind of the backdrop to our lives. I&#8217;ve brought it into the present and put a new spin on it. I&#8217;ve had people at my shows get quite emotional because they think of Dean.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting because the album&#8217;s not specifically about Dean, though. A lot of these songs predated his passing.</strong><br/>
Oh, yeah. ?The Repairer?, which is the third track, is about Dean. A lot of these songs are about other people, or other relationships, infatuations or personal things, sort of psychoanalysing certain reactions to certain events &#8211; A lot of it is psychological exploration. Then there&#8217;s ?The Repairer?, which is specifically about Dean.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20497390?portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Those early recordings with Dean &#8211; how much of a bearing did they have on the finished product?</strong><br/>
Well, a lot. He was involved in the selection process and we spoke a lot about the aesthetic of the record. There were a lot of buzz words we came up with together: minimal, raw, stripped-back. When he could he came to some live shows. I&#8217;d play a new song I&#8217;d written for the album and he&#8217;d say, ?That&#8217;s a great song. You should do that song.? He was very involved with the bulk of the making of the record, and he came into the studio a few times.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like an album with a very clear artistic vision. Do you think you&#8217;ve realised what you and Dean set out to achieve?</strong><br/>
Absolutely, and it came really easily. Once the songs were selected, we both knew how it would go. It was a matter of just getting the takes, making sure we got the right textures and sounds.</p>
<p><strong>The stark instrumentation &#8211; was that born out of playing live by yourself?</strong><br/>
I think that had something to do with it. That was the initial idea: Dean encouraged me to do some live shows. I was writing at the same time, but doing the live shows cemented the idea of putting the record out, because if I couldn&#8217;t do the live thing, there was no point in putting the record out. I roadtested some of the songs and that helped me finesse the arrangements. I think definitely [playing] live had something to do with it, but demoing the songs really helped as well. We just chose the songs that almost refused to have a beat. It would be a totally different ballgame if there was a band behind a lot of these songs. I&#8217;ve tried jamming ?Invite Me? with a few drummers and it&#8217;s really hard to get a good beat to it. And these are good drummers; they&#8217;re fucking great drummers! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>But the guitar implies the rhythm, and as a result the songs move around a bit.</strong><br/>
Well, yeah, exactly. It was kind of an experiment, really, to see if it could happen. We just committed to it: ?If this experimental, let&#8217;s commit, let&#8217;s make a record and see if it flies.?</p>
<p><strong>And I guess that approach has typified Magic Dirt&#8217;s last few records as well.</strong><br/>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s been like that with <em>every</em> record &#8211; even the really big produced ones. It&#8217;s always been a risk, but an exciting risk, because we were so committed to every record and every song we recorded. You just send it out into the world and see what happens with it. At the time, you&#8217;re fully committed to the experiment &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a slick pop-styled record or a raw stripped-back thing.</p>
<p><strong>But there&#8217;s always a concept at the start?</strong><br/>
Yeah, or a feeling. I like to approach things in an obtuse, loose kind of way, but have strong feelings about how it should sound or how it should be. If I stray away from that, I get a bad feeling straight away and I know I&#8217;m off on the wrong track. [It&#8217;s about] loose concepts, strong feelings.</p>
<p><strong>And ultimately cohesive albums.</strong><br/>
Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Were any of these songs considered for Magic Dirt?</strong><br/>
No, they were written just for the record. But there is a kinda of stockpile, or library of songs that I&#8217;ve written over the years that have either been rejected from Magic Dirt, because they were too kooky or just didn&#8217;t fit in. I&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of that stuff, but I couldn&#8217;t use it for the record &#8211; it just didn&#8217;t feel right &#8211; so I decided to write a fresh batch of where I was at at that time.</p>
<p><strong>So the shelf life of these songs is 2009?</strong><br/>
2008.</p>
<p><strong>Has a solo record occurred to you in the past given all these tracks kicking around?</strong><br/>
No, I was pretty much in Magic Dirt and that was it. There was never really a need or a want.</p>
<p><strong>Did it feel like cheating?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] No no. I guess Magic Dirt was so busy and prolific.</p>
<p><strong>And no real side projects either.</strong><br/>
No, not really. We all just loved being in the band, that was our lives. It was such a great band. No room for anything else, and no need for anything else. It was very satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>The word ?was? is pretty interesting.</strong><br/>
Well, this is?</p>
<p><strong>A new phase of the band, I guess?</strong><br/>
Well, yeah. Without Dean it&#8217;s different.</p>
<p><strong>Are you hoping this record paves the way for more solo albums?</strong><br/>
Oh, yeah. I&#8217;ve started writing for the second one. I&#8217;m hoping to get stuck into the writing after this solo tour. I&#8217;ve got about three [songs] ready: one new one and two really old ones that I&#8217;m hoping to rework. I feel like I&#8217;m getting a bit more raucous. I feel like getting louder. [<em>Laughs</em>] </p>
<p><strong>Was there always the intention to call this album <em>Adalita</em>?</strong><br/>
No, I was struggling with the title. I had pages and pages of ideas and I was really trying hard to come up with something &#8211; A lot of first albums are self-titled, and it felt right, so I just called it that. Nothing else was really working, but when I gave it a bit of a thought, something clicked. I thought, ?That&#8217;ll do.?</p>

<p><strong>Putting yourself on the cover is a very solo artist thing to do.</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah. There was always the thought about having myself on the cover, so it&#8217;s good to get that one out of the way. On the next one, I might not be on the cover. You think about the marketing, and all that branding shit, I wanted people to know what I look like. I guess that plays a part in advertising your wares. But I think overall, I&#8217;m not really a business person, so it was more of an aesthetic, gut decision. I think it works well. I wanted it to look pretty and with the booklet, I wanted to be a beautiful package that was simple and nice to look at.</p>
<p><strong>Those are all your photographs in the booklet?</strong><br/>
Yeah, and [Melbourne photographer] Warwick Baker did the cover shot.</p>
<p><strong>He did the cover for My Disco&#8217;s <em>Paradise</em>, which was very evocative.</strong><br/>
Right, yeah. He&#8217;s amazing. The label got me onto him, and I&#8217;m so glad.</p>
<p><strong>The photos in the [CD] book are all yours. Have they been picked to match up with the songs?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been taking amateur shots for a four- or five-year period. I started going through all the photos with the album playing in the background, and just whittled it down till the right one matched the page of lyrics. I was just going on feeling again &#8211; I&#8217;ve just got one of those point-and-shoot cameras, but I&#8217;ve fallen in love with it [photography].</p>
<p><strong>The guest musicians on the record &#8211; Amaya [Laucirica] and JP [Shilo] &#8211; you spoke in the release about developing an almost subconscious understanding with them. Did you know them before?</strong><br/>
I did. I&#8217;m one of those people who like working with friends. [<em>Laughs</em>] I met Amaya ages ago, maybe 2003 or 2004, down at a Richmond rehearsal studio called Midian. We [Magic Dirt] were rehearsing and when we stopped we heard this lovely little sound next door. I poked my head in and introduced myself and started following their shows. I&#8217;ve known Amaya for a while. We&#8217;ve done some Neil Young covers and just kinda hung out. We did ?Good Girl?, the track that&#8217;s on the record, live a couple times when she supported me, so I wanted her on the record. And JP, I knew from Hungry Ghosts days in the late ?90s. I only befriended him through Rowland [S Howard], when he started playing with Rowland over the last few years. He asked me to collaborate on his solo record, so I asked him to collaborate on my record.</p>
<p>JP&#8217;s really serious about music, but he&#8217;s the loveliest guy. He&#8217;s a really calming influence &#8211; and so creative. He literally just jumped into the studio and played on the tracks that I selected for him then and there. He was improvising, doing this spontaneous thing. We get each other. It&#8217;s very relaxing to be around him. He&#8217;s smart and talented and very brave. I don&#8217;t think he realises that because he&#8217;s naturally like that. He doesn&#8217;t give a shit about anything except playing music, and playing it well.</p>
<p><strong>And he played on Amaya&#8217;s record [<em>Early Summer</em>] as well.</strong><br/>
He did! He&#8217;s a very in-demand musician.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I remember a show I did in the Blue Mountains. You could hear someone open a chip packet.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d love to talk about the guitar tones. They&#8217;re integral to the sound of this record.</strong><br/>
That was really important because it was just vocal and guitar. We laboured over the mic positions on the amp: which mic, which angle, which part of the room, which speaker, you know, ?Turn up the treble a bit more.? The engineer &#8211; Brent Punshon as he likes to be known, but I just call him ?Sloth? &#8211; is kinda the same as me. He&#8217;s very OCD &#8211; Once we get together in the studio, we can spend hours deliberating. Sloth really helped get that great guitar sound through his mic selection. I bought a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe particularly for the solo stuff and the recording &#8211; I wanted to get a great guitar sound going into the desk without too much effect, so that the foundation was solid. The same went for the vocal as well, just making sure we got the right texture. It&#8217;s a bit more difficult because the voice is a lot more variable than the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Lots of reverb, obviously.</strong><br/>
Yeah, yeah. I love the reverb on everything. [<em>Laughs</em>] But once I got the guitar sound right, that was a real weight off my back. Once we got that &#8211; it took about half a day &#8211; then it was just ?go?. All the songs have the same guitar setting, we didn&#8217;t really move it around all that much.</p>
<p><strong>The tone on ?Goin Down? sounds like a practice amp.</strong><br/>
That was a loop. I can&#8217;t replicate the riff &#8211; I&#8217;ve tried. It was a freak accident at my rehearsal studio one day. I was playing this riff and just put it on my loop. Luckily, I would&#8217;ve recorded it on the loop, otherwise I would&#8217;ve lost it. There&#8217;s no other way to get that sound or riff but turn on my loop station &#8211; There&#8217;s another loop on ?Hot Air?, but that&#8217;s a clean guitar. They&#8217;re the only two loops on the record.</p>
<p><strong>Were the guitars and vocals recorded at the same time?</strong><br/>
Vocals afterwards. It was too hard to do at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t sound like it.</strong><br/>
Oh, cool. That&#8217;s good. It was a full-on record to make because I had to make sure the guitar was right and the vocals were right; they synthesised, it was the right take, the right emotion, the right character. The listener was going to hear everything because it&#8217;s so stripped-back.</p>
<p><strong>Did it take a long time to make the record?</strong><br/>
It took a long time to mix. The recording didn&#8217;t take as long &#8211; it was definitely hard, especially the vocal. I hadn&#8217;t done that many live shows, so I hadn&#8217;t played the songs that much. I think if I had two years of live shows it would&#8217;ve been easier &#8211; I could&#8217;ve done with more time to live with the songs, but that&#8217;s how recording goes. But then after you&#8217;ve played them for two years you go, ?Oh, I should&#8217;ve put that in the song!? or, ?Now I know how to play this bit!? The mixing was full-on. We had to keep adding days on. It stretched out and stretched out.</p>
<p><strong>Are you comfortable now touring the album?</strong><br/>
Definitely now, yes. The first couple years of playing [solo] shows were pretty difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Just dealing with a quieter room?</strong><br/>
It was full-on. I remember a show I did in the Blue Mountains. You could hear someone open a chip packet. [<em>Laughs*] I was just like, ?Fuck this!? I had to make a joke about it. Everybody laughed and it broke the ice. I&#8217;m sure the audience was thinking, ?What do we do??, the same way I was thinking, ?What do *I* do?? It&#8217;s like a partnership. There&#8217;s this aspect of it that I&#8217;m getting more comfortable with &#8211; I just feel more relaxed with the silences. I can banter in between, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that nerve-wracked thing anymore. I guess the silences are due to my nerves, rather than me taking it too seriously or it being too sombre. Now that the nerves have dissipated a bit, I find that I can &#8211; speak! [*Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It seems like there&#8217;d be more pressure to be an entertainer in this context</strong><br/>
Exactly, and I&#8217;m not an entertainer. I can be myself: sometimes I&#8217;m funny, but sometimes I&#8217;m not. A gig&#8217;s a gig, you know. Every one of them is different. You just have to go with the flow; you can&#8217;t force it if it&#8217;s not working.</p>
<p><strong>Gareth from The Drones has made that transition [to solo artist] well.</strong><br/>
Yeah, he&#8217;s amazing. He&#8217;s funny as all fuck and he just makes you laugh. He&#8217;s got these amazing songs that are really profound &#8211; they take you to another place and they&#8217;re really serious &#8211; and then he can just relax you and tell really funny stories in between. But he&#8217;s just being natural, being himself, and not really forcing it. He&#8217;s entertaining and genius at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Have you learnt things from people like Gaz?</strong><br/>
Oh, yeah. I take in everything when I see bands play. I was taking a lot in when I was watching Blondie and The Pretenders, and of course when I see people like Gareth or people like PJ [Harvey] on TV. It&#8217;s interesting watching how they do things, not taking that on board, just taking inspiration: I&#8217;ll do it my way, I&#8217;ll be myself. But definitely over the years, I&#8217;ve picked up a few tips, a few tricks along the way.</p>
