                <h3>With Dallas Crane settled into a self-induced coma, Dave Larkin has poured his energies into new trio Gun Street Girls. <strong>JOSH JENNINGS</strong> speaks to the top hat-sporting frontman about knuckling down in the studio, European aspirations and what it&#8217;s like to start from scratch.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3005972/440x362-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The light bulb went off last year while Dave Larkin was in Europe, temping on bass guitar for The Double Agents. The European audiences were overwhelmingly receptive to the gigs and it infected Larkin with the itch to helm a new band (with Dallas Crane indefinitely out of the picture) and try his own luck in Europe. He blooded Double Agents Dave Butterworth (bass/vox) and Callum John Barter (drums/vox) and the result is Gun Street Girls. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken the trio about a year to cough up their self-titled debut album, an unashamedly and unapologetically straight-up, vein-popping Australian pub rock record replete with loud-and-proud guitars, shouty vocals and thrashing 4/4 drum beats. Before they commence their courtship of Europe, a slew of album launch dates around the east coast beckons.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of studio band are Gun Street Girls? Do you wheel in kegs of beer or do you find yourselves putting the kettle on?</strong><br/>
A bit of both, a bit of everything. I guess when you&#8217;re paying so much money for the space and time it doesn&#8217;t become Phil Spector Gold Star studios or anything with parties and John Lennon popping in and Harry Nilsson. We kind of save all the celebrating and stuffing around until it&#8217;s all done. We&#8217;re a lot more refined these days. So there&#8217;s more beer-flavoured tea perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>You were in and out of the studio quickly. Blessing or curse?</strong><br/>
What made some of the other records longer [with Dallas Crane] was that, for a start, there&#8217;s another member &#8211; there&#8217;s another instrument to mix. There&#8217;s the whole process of going back and forth to people at your record label and getting approval and all that sort of process that&#8217;s involved when there&#8217;s 10 or 15 people at some stage signing off on things. Now there are three people signing off and the mixing gets done at our own leisure and we get it to sound how we want it to sound. You&#8217;re not going through two or three other people at the studio trying to achieve what we&#8217;re doing now, which is putting it down how we want to do it. For us, songwriting is the most important thing and the performance. Not to shun the whole production process, but for me that is the production process: that&#8217;s the most important bit.</p>
<p><strong>You produced <em>Gun Street Girls</em>. What was that experience like?</strong><br/>
I loved it. I produce a lot of stuff that I don&#8217;t really take credit for. I guess I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;ve always done which is write and arrange and pull sounds and what not. But I guess now it&#8217;s official. I&#8217;ve always given someone else the credit on our records, which is fine. But I guess this band is very much about making up for a lot of the things we could have done better in the past.</p>
<blockquote><p>?You have to convince your family at Christmas that this is your new girlfriend. They liked the old one, but they really have to like this one too. So give her a go and don&#8217;t give her too much of the arms-folded shit.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What were the biggest difficulties you encountered, recording the album?</strong><br/>
There weren&#8217;t really any major obstacles because most of the rehearsing had already been done and we knew we just had to go in there and bash it out. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of time in the studio and we just wanted to spend as long as we had to in there and get out. There was a lot of freedom with this record; in the past there have been more guys signing off and different people with different money invested signing off. But there was none of that this time. It was back to its purest form.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to Dallas Crane, Gun Street Girls is a very new band. What are the pros and cons of being in a new band?</strong><br/>
The pros are its new, exciting and fresh and the hunger is there again. It&#8217;s great; for me personally it&#8217;s like being reinvigorated and being back to what it was like playing in a band when you first start one. It&#8217;s really fun and you start cultivating all these dreams and ambitions and all that is happening now again for this band. </p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t a lot of cons, but you have to try not to make the band be treated as a side project or a lesser of Dallas. Because it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s become my main band now with Dallas resting in its self-induced coma. The cons I guess are like when you have to convince your family at Christmas that this is your new girlfriend. They liked the old one, but they really have to like this one too. So give her a go and don&#8217;t give her too much of the arms-folded shit.</p>
<p><strong>You tour wraps up at the end of September. What happens next?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re just trying to circulate the band around the live scene from here until the next record, which will probably be some time next year if we can pull it together. But for now it&#8217;s just about getting out in front of as many people as we can and we definitely want to get back to Europe &#8211; not exclusively Europe, but that&#8217;s out first port of call. That&#8217;s high on the agenda and that was high on the agenda for getting this band going, to be able to travel overseas and really take it a bit more seriously than perhaps I have in the past. Having done it now with the Double Agents, it&#8217;s definitely high on the band&#8217;s agenda to get back quite regularly.</p>
