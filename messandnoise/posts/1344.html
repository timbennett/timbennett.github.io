                <h3>After relocating to Berlin with her duo royalchord &#8211; and a couple of Robert Palmer covers later &#8211; Tammy Haider is back in Melbourne and launching a solo EP. She tells all to <strong>DAVID NICHOLS<em>*. Photo by *</em>OLIE WILLIAMS</strong>.

I do wonder what propelled me. I think it was kind of like a relentless kind of restlessness wanting to see the world, to see what more there was outside Australia. Now, coming home, I couldn&#8217;t be happier. </p>
<p>I moved to Berlin and kept playing music with <a href="http://royalchord.bandcamp.com/">royalchord</a> but I guess &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how to put it eloquently &#8211; it&#8217;s not easy going to Europe and playing music. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think it is a great thing to do if you can make it work. When we left we did it in a kind of na&#8217;ve way and I think it was one of those spontaneous decisions that at the time seemed like the perfect thing to do. It was a little bit more difficult than I anticipated. </p>
<p>When we arrived there we only knew one person (a friend of a friend), and we started meeting people through people. Moving to another country is always hard for obvious reasons: settling in and finding a likeminded music community, the language barrier, work. It all took time, though soon enough we met a lot of cool, likeminded people, who became our friends and were also inspiring musicians and songwriters.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d started recording <a href="/releases/2000466">2009?s] <em>[The Good Fight</a></em> by the time we officially moved. We were in Berlin for six months when we finished recording it, and then we came back to Australia. </p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3735643540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""></iframe><a href="http://royalchord.bandcamp.com/album/the-good-fight">The Good Fight by Royalchord</a></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>We recorded an album of covers, called <em>Dogs*. It&#8217;s finished <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=7_SAMrDnXOE">but not yet released]. We&#8217;d always played covers in our set and it seemed like a good segue to where we were going instrumentally. It just seemed like a natural thing to do as songwriters; we&#8217;d gotten to a place where we felt confident reinterpreting other artist&#8217;s material and were up for the challenge. I think there was an overlap; some of the songs were recorded at the time *The Good Fight</em> was recorded. We do songs like [?Johnny and Mary?</a> by Robert Palmer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=B0WwY1VQeqM">?Beautiful Boys?</a> by Sean Kingston, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=ZrffDM3hHk8">?Can&#8217;t Get It Out of My Head?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=DSjB3XmW30w">by] ELO, [[?You Got It?</a>] by] Roy Orbison, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=2YO0WyOGHjU">?I Didn&#8217;t Mean to Turn You On?</a>, which is also by Robert Palmer. </p>
<blockquote><p>?We weren&#8217;t playing the venues we wanted to.?</p></blockquote>
<p>We weren&#8217;t really playing as much as we had hoped. We went to France, Switzerland, we did two little tours; really we were playing once every six months. Mainly we were getting to a point sonically where we were doing everything with two people. It was different when we were here in Melbourne &#8211; we had a band, played in professional venues. We played mainly small bars in Berlin &#8211; there are so many places you can play there, it&#8217;s relatively easy to get gigs, [and] over time I got to know a lot of people. But with the small bars, Eliza was having to do a lot of the mixing. It was a bit stressful in the end &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t be playing as much as we wanted to. We needed to build up a network of promoters to be able to tour more in Europe, which isn&#8217;t so easy. We weren&#8217;t playing the venues we wanted to. </p>
<p>But life sort of happened in a way. Everything was in limbo. Eliza was feeling a pull to have some financial stability in her life and she opened a Mexican burrito restaurant in Berlin, <a href="http://www.burritobaby.de">Burrito Baby</a>, with her husband, and became quite busy with that. It&#8217;s really successful, it&#8217;s totally worked, and if you are ever in Berlin you must go there!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d only ever played solo once, in Toronto, a long time ago. I&#8217;d never really considered doing it before. I can&#8217;t really put my finger on it why I didn&#8217;t think it was something I would or could do. But Eliza was really supportive of me starting to play solo in Berlin, and I think it&#8217;s been important for me to be able to express myself musically. But I began doing that, and she became busy with the restaurant. She thought that she would spend six months starting it up, but that six months turned into a longer period of time, and she had to focus on that and I could understand why. It wasn&#8217;t problematic; it actually has turned out to be a good thing for me to do.</p>

<p/>
<p>Of course I miss royalchord. That goes without saying. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a big change &#8211; obviously royalchord was a big part of my sonic aesthetic &#8211; and there&#8217;s something that sounds quite royalchord about what I am doing now. </p>
<p>When I made the EP <a href="http://www.bunnysuitmusic.com"><em>Genuine Feeling</em>] I had just begun playing solo. I wasn&#8217;t overanalysing what I was doing, I was mainly focusing on making a recording with songs I felt proud of. I recorded with Cameron Laing [from [Bunny Suit</a>], we were putting heaps of stuff on, a kind of layer-upon-layer recording approach, and then subtracting from the mixes. I guess I&#8217;d written maybe four of the songs when we began recording.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s important for me to develop on my own.?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to do an album or maybe an EP this year. I want to be able to do as much as I can myself. I have a good friend that I bounce a lot of stuff off, from song ideas to equipment possibilities, but it&#8217;s important for me to keep control of stuff in a way and develop on my own. I think it&#8217;s healthy. </p>
<p>An artist whose album I really liked a lot &#8211; in terms of songwriting themes &#8211; would be Angel Olsen. That&#8217;s more on a thematic scale I guess &#8211; I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about that kind of thing lately: why and what is appealing about different artists? songwriting styles and vibe. And I&#8217;ve been listening to <a href="/articles/4651933">Teeth &amp; Tongue</a>. I felt like I got something from them as far as songwriting goes; there is something deeply compelling about them. They&#8217;re the contemporaries that come to mind, sonically and thematically, [in terms of] where I&#8217;d like to go. </p>

<p/>
<p>To be honest with you, I did feel a little bit like coming back. The whole reason that I left had fallen by the wayside. I felt weird coming back under those circumstances. I&#8217;m a bit paranoid about how it comes across; I&#8217;m not sure if royalchord&#8217;s over, we said it&#8217;s going to keep going &#8211; it&#8217;s a touchy subject for me &#8211; and it was Eliza who suggested I come back [to Australia]. I said, ?I can&#8217;t do that, people will think I failed? and she was like, ?Fuck what people think.? It is a little weird sometimes, in the context of what we just talked about.</p>
<p>At the same time, it would be weird and stupid to stay away just because of that. Whatever people think about people who make it or don&#8217;t make it, I&#8217;m proud of my ability to keep going. What is ?making it? anyway? You just can&#8217;t see things so black-and-white.</p>
