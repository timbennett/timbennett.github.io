                <h3>Why Gosford DIY rapper $hmyl may be Australia&#8217;s answer to Odd Future&#8217;s Tyler The Creator &#8211; not that we really wanted one, writes <strong>SHAUN PRESCOTT</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3028594/448x299-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
DIY Aussie hip-hop only goes viral when it&#8217;s deemed tasteless, or stupid, or hilarious, by the middlebrow folk who share it on their preferred social networks. RAED, that Kingsgrove crew, and Bangs (though Bangs is amazing and fuck the haters) demonstrate that the strongest emotion a bedroom-oriented hip-hop project in Australia can hope for is outright hostility. And let&#8217;s face it: RAED is punching above his weight, and the Kingsgrove blokes &#8211; can&#8217;t even remember their name &#8211; are trying to badass-ify an emphatically not bad-arse suburb of Sydney&#8217;s inner-west. The likes of Shane Skillz seem more class-stereotype than class war. $hmyl makes all these guys look like cartoon darlings.</p>
<p>When I listen to $hmyl&#8217;s new single, I&#8217;m struggling to differentiate, stylistically and lyrically, between his wares and those of transient critical darlings Odd Future. Search YouTube for $hmyl&#8217;s early material and it&#8217;s all uploaded in late 2011, which embeds the suspicion that he&#8217;s either been influenced by OF or he&#8217;s been touched by the same collective consciousness as his stateside peers. I&#8217;m betting on the latter. $hmyl doesn&#8217;t exhibit a great deal of MC virtuosity but he&#8217;s definitely got a feel for it, and his lyrics revel in that same juvenile male gorepit that Tyler The Creator&#8217;s record bathed in to a confronting degree. It&#8217;s not pleasant, and there&#8217;s a lot to get angry about: a mock-celebratory attitude toward rape and violence, a complete lack of poetic acumen, all sub-male teenage brawn and bloodshot eyes. It&#8217;s hostile music: stream-of-consciousness bile, patently offensive to an almost surreal degree.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>$hmyl may not sound as mellifluous and poetic as Odd Future&#8217;s rappers, but he knows how to work with the beat, and few will deny that &#8216;Don&#8217;t Fuck With $hmyl&#8217; has a compelling backbone, as GarageBand composed as it sounds, and as horrorcore influenced &#8211; subconsciously or otherwise &#8211; as it obviously is. The song itself is actually fine: the rapping is sloppy but it&#8217;s no less emphatically-bedroom-borne than many Southern US rappers. The Aussie accent is a learning curve but it&#8217;s surmountable. The best studio tools could make this a hit. It&#8217;s the ugly subject matter, divorced from that thick, not-of-this-world US baritone we&#8217;ve come to forgive for these transgressions, that is the culture shock. Australians can accept it from afar, but up close? Forget it.</p>
<p>Why does the most sexually confrontational type of hip-hop always become the most powerful? In an era when it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to become a legitimate male bread-winner; when it&#8217;s more and more difficult to aspire to manliness in the most commonly heroic sense (buying a house, supporting a family, happily sleeping with the same woman, over and over again), it&#8217;s not difficult to understand why young male renegades would want to make a putrid mess of it in music. To make masculinity a demonic, eroded, ugly and reprehensible scourge.</p>

<p>The French novelist Michel Houellebecq posited in his first novel (<em>Whatever</em>) that the counter-cultural sexual liberation in the &#8217;60s turned sex into a type of commodity, or currency. Sex, Houllebecq wrote, was transformed by our beloved baby boomers into a mutant strand of free-market capitalism: those with the currency (looks, charisma) took everything, while those who had no currency languished in sexless misery. They became embittered by their inability to succeed in this sexual, newly ?free-market? economy. The liberationists claimed sex should be had for its own sake, because it&#8217;s a really fun thing to do. But what of the substantial population that probably weren&#8217;t getting sex to begin with, and never had any hope of doing it regularly? Especially now, post sexual-liberation, when we still desire ruthless, guiltless, ecstatically meaningless sex just for the fun of it, yet we&#8217;ve demured slightly from the free-for-all orgies of the &#8217;60s? That&#8217;s a class divide that can never be bridged. If you&#8217;re ugly and charmless, you&#8217;re that forever: nothing can fix you. You can&#8217;t change the course.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3028593/640x416-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>The understanding nowadays, on a base level, is that money = sex. Attractiveness = sex. Charisma = sex. You may not get it, but you still feel entitled. Pulled between the sexual liberation of the ?60s and the contemporary obsession with financial eligibility of the now, there is definitely bile circulating, and it&#8217;s gonna/gotta be deposited somewhere. We know the kind of sex that successful, attractive, rich people have &#8211; we&#8217;re exposed to it via popular culture everyday, relentlessly so &#8211; but when there is no feasible outlet with which to express or actually live that fantasy out, why wouldn&#8217;t you sing about it in the most overt, artless way? It&#8217;s constantly, menacingly on your mind, especially if you&#8217;re a young teenage male.</p>
<p>So when $hmyl talks of slipping a pill when a girl is unwilling, is that not similar to Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s hostile takeover of a corporation? Sex is something to be secured aggressively. Every lay is a box ticked. Every woman is an acquisition signed on the dotted line. Sex has no mystique and it is not special: we can watch people have it off &#8211; in the most exotic ways &#8211; whenever we want, free to air or free to wire. The desire to live that out is all the more powerful.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Why does the most sexually confrontational type of hip-hop always become the most powerful??</p></blockquote>
<p>Where does this leave the theoretical other, the person on the receiving end of $hmyl&#8217;s hyper-sexualised fantasies? Likewise, should we attempt to rescind our modern sexual freedom in the name of potentially curbing violent sexual fantasies in young, frustrated men? Who actually fucking knows? But perhaps it&#8217;s time to understand that certain elements of sexual anger will rear their ugly heads in popular culture, and probably with exponential regularity, from now into forever. And we can&#8217;t control it because we perpetuate it. If sex has been liberated, as we always hoped, then this is inevitably the result. Young males are gonna be keen to be ?sucked off? for now and forever.</p>
<p>$hmyl&#8217;s clip plays out against a visage of urban decay: endless, wide dark roads bookended by a deep suburban nothingness. Vast green pastures dotted with steep mounds of dirt. The environs within which $hmyl spits his rhymes are half-done &#8211; exburban zones forgotten and decayed, crossed by fourteen-year-olds liable to get their heads kicked in, probably, if they&#8217;re a loser. It&#8217;s the teenage reality, one that older folk don&#8217;t usually understand. Sexual demonstrativeness may be the only class leveller: $hmyl has young, flabby pecks. He&#8217;s not sexy. His mates aren&#8217;t sexy, but presumably there is some outlet in advising everyone that they will fuck you six ways sideways given the slightest of opportunities. A female&#8217;s ?cunt? is something to be obtained and mastered: something to be ruthlessly fucked, applauded and forgotten. It&#8217;s horrible and reprehensible and offensive, totally! But next time you&#8217;re listening to US parallels with a comfortable sense of ironic distance, remember that many also do with a tense, angry determination. </p>
<p>Pop music isn&#8217;t always gonna be a salve for your day-to-day anomie. Pop music will fuck you HARD. Even in your own backyard.</p>
