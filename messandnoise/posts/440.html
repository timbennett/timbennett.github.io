                <h3>As his ?Burning Leaves? national tour winds up at Melbourne&#8217;s Forum Theatre tomorrow (April 24), Paul Dempsey talks to <strong>JP HAMMOND</strong> about moving to New York, writing with a sense of place and how he became an ?accidental? flag bearer at Melbourne&#8217;s SLAM rally in February.

<strong>This is your last tour in Australia before moving to New York City. What&#8217;s prompted the move?</strong><br/>
Firstly I just want to get the record out there but really I just love it there. I&#8217;ve always wanted to spend some kind of extended period of time in New York and I just want to play as much as possible. It&#8217;s easier with the solo record to spend an extended period overseas, rather than having a whole band, so it feels like the right time to head over there and play some shows. </p>
<p><strong>You spent some time mixing [debut solo album] <em>Everything Is True</em> in Los Angeles with Doug Boehm [Elliot Smith, French Kicks]. Did you ever give any thought to moving to LA?</strong><br/>
Not really, to be honest. Something For Kate spent about three or four months there back a few years ago and, although I don&#8217;t mind the city, there&#8217;s actually a lot less opportunities to play shows over there. If you&#8217;re based in LA, you can play there one night and then the options have to be playing in San Diego or going six hours north to San Francisco. The thing with NYC is that you can play five nights a week because it&#8217;s so easy to move from New York to New Jersey to Philadelphia to Boston. They&#8217;re all really near there. So it&#8217;s more based around playing as much as I can, and having more options.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I guess in Melbourne if you have to drive 10 hours you end up in Sydney. In New York, you drive six hours and you&#8217;re in Montreal &#8211; and you can go past Boston on the way.</strong><br/>
Yeah, and flying it&#8217;s just so close. But I also prefer NYC as a city. LA is fun and there are good parts I enjoy. There&#8217;s parts of LA where you can head just a short way down the road and you can feel like you&#8217;re nowhere near Hollywood. But LA just doesn&#8217;t seem as good for music at the moment. I don&#8217;t know how many great bands are coming out of there. I struggle to think of one actually.</p>
<p><strong>I guess the last ?hype? band from there was probably Cold War Kids &#8211; and even they&#8217;re more of a Canyon band, than strictly Hollywood.</strong><br/>
I didn&#8217;t even know they were from LA. The last band I heard from that part of the world was Crystal Antlers from San Diego. Actually, I saw a band at South By South West [where Dempsey played some solo shows recently] called WarPaint. They&#8217;re four girls from LA. They were definitely pretty interesting.</p>
<p><strong>I guess LA does have a strong, reactionary punk history with Black Flag and X.</strong><br/>
Paul Dempsey: Yeah, those bands were such a reaction to LA. They were all down from the beaches, Black Flag, The Descendents. They were all coming out of the southern beaches (rather than Hollywood). They were like the anti-LA sound. I don&#8217;t think that exists much anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s true to me too that I feel very much like I&#8217;m a Melbourne person, and Something For Kate are a Melbourne band, and I&#8217;m a Melbourne songwriter.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I asked whether you were interested in moving to LA because one of my favourite comments about a track off <em>Everything is True* was something *M+N</em> contributor Craig Mathieson wrote in his top 10 songs of 2009 for triple j. He said your single ?Ramona Was A Waitress? was a ?Californian song: a smashing LA melody, Palo Alto technology and the belief that you can always remake yourself?. I really love that description &#8211; it fits the song perfectly. Were you at all inspired by any of your previous experiences in LA for any of the songs on the record?</strong><br/>
No, they were all written here. We did the whole record here and then we went over to LA to mix it. I can kinda understand the reference &#8211; maybe just the name Ramona and the whole waitress, diner thing.</p>
<p><strong>I always thought it was a New York song, actually &#8211; just because you talk about the bar under the third bridge which, for me, always seemed like a reference to the Williamsburg Bridge [in NYC].</strong><br/>
The Ramona in the song is actually supposed to be this kind of artificial intelligence and the third bridge is &#8211; Ah. OK. [<em>Sighs</em>] There&#8217;s this guy, Ray Kurzweil, who has all these wacky ideas about paths to artificial intelligence and trans-humanism and the third bridge is actually a part of his concept of when human beings will transcend their biology.</p>
<p><strong>OK. I was way off!</strong><br/>
No, no. I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever got that and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m bothering to explain it now. I guess I liked the idea of the third bridge concept and it seemed like a funny place to locate the song. </p>
<p><strong>The song you&#8217;re promoting on this tour is ?Bats?. That song has always stuck out for me on the record, not merely because it&#8217;s the first song but because it has an almost Grant Lee Buffalo feel to it. Did you feel that the solo album gave you a chance to explore those sounds and influences? Were they a band you were drawing from?</strong><br/>
Not so much. There&#8217;s a demo version of that song which is kinda hilarious. It&#8217;s all electric guitars and, y&#8217;know, parts of it are quite overblown. It was really a very different song. It was bombastic, ?70s, proggy rock kinda thing. But I had no lyrics. So, when I wrote the lyrics it began to take shape a bit more. It just started to feel more like a ballad in my head, so I softened everything. </p>
<p>And the vocal line, which is that high-falsetto which I guess is why you&#8217;re making an obvious comparison to Grant Lee Buffalo or whatever, was originally one of the guitar lines from bombastic version. I didn&#8217;t have anything to sing in the chorus and I guess I just thought, ?Wow, that melody is really fucking high but maybe I should just try singing it.? And then it felt different for me, like I was really pushing the boundaries of my voice and that&#8217;s why it felt good. Like, ?Great, this is really, really high for me to be singing.? [<em>Laughs</em>] You have to keep pushing it a bit.</p>
<p><strong>I guess we&#8217;ve started down this discussion about place now and ?Bats? feels like a really ?Melbourne? song. Although you&#8217;ve never really written a Melbourne song before, to me you&#8217;ve always been a distinctly Melbourne songwriter. That&#8217;s strange, because you don&#8217;t really write about place &#8211; you often reference a lot of theories and theorists, say, for example, Max Planck in Something For Kate material rather than iconography from the city. But ?Bats? feels like the culmination of something &#8211; like you finally wrote that ?Melbourne? song.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s interesting because ?Bats? is probably, well, definitely, it&#8217;s the first time I consciously decided to write a song about my home town. It&#8217;s absolutely a song about Melbourne. I set out to do that. I wanted to imagine the city. It&#8217;s a song about Melbourne but, there&#8217;s a second person there, and Melbourne almost ends up as the person to whom you&#8217;re addressing the song. It&#8217;s as though the city is a person. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s true to me too that I feel very much like I&#8217;m a Melbourne person, and Something For Kate are a Melbourne band, and I&#8217;m a Melbourne songwriter &#8211; Actually, Something For Kate wrote a song called ?Chapel Street?! But that was a more whimsical sort of thing. Maybe it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;ve been around a long time. Even if people have never known much about us, or liked us, or come to our shows, we&#8217;ve just always been around in Melbourne. We&#8217;ve just been knocking around in Melbourne venues for so long.</p>

<strong>Well, it seemed to make sense that you were up the front holding the banner for the Save Live Music <a href="/articles/3882468">rally</a> a few months back. It&#8217;s obviously something that you were very passionate about. Do you want to talk about your involvement in that and why it&#8217;s important to you?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I&#8217;m passionate about it for all the obvious reasons &#8211; everything I just said, basically. I&#8217;ve been in a band in this city for fifteen years and without the venues and the live music culture that we have here, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I am doing today, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to build an audience. I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t think I need to go into why it&#8217;s important. You all know why it&#8217;s important. I just intended to be there on the day and lend my support to the march. How I ended up at the front of the march &#8211; well, that&#8217;s a whole other story. They asked me to turn up at a certain time to chat to the media. That was fine, that was something I was really happy to do. And then they kinda pushed all the musicians up the front, in front of the truck and pulled the banner out. Then there was a press person running around and, then suddenly, at the end of the march near the top of Bourke Street she just grabbed me and a few others and asked if we could hold the banner for a bit. The next thing we were on the stage and we just stood there for two hours holding the banner.[<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s become the iconic shot of the rally, really. You standing there, holding the banner, walking along the tram tracks.</strong><br/>
Well, it was accidental. But, more importantly, it was great thing to be a part of and, even though the government have subsequently come to the table, they still deserved the fucking gigantic rebuke that they got. Because it was so fucking short-sighted! [<em>Sighs*] Like, how out of touch could they be? I don&#8217;t know. [*Pauses</em>] It just really surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Noga from The Drones is joining your band for this last tour around Australia before the move. Is this the first time you&#8217;ve played with Mike?</strong><br/>
Paul Dempsey: He&#8217;s just played with us at Southbound festival. Apart from that we&#8217;ve had lots of rehearsals and I&#8217;ve known him for a fair while as well. Shannon Vandewert [from Dallas Crane] was playing drums before and he was a fantastic drummer. Mike&#8217;s an incredible drummer as well but he has a very different style. It&#8217;s great &#8211; you can change one member and the whole experience feels new again. If anything, hell, Mike and I are just potentially bad influences on each other.</p>

<p>Paul Dempsey performs in Melbourne at The Forum Theatre tomorrow (April 24).</p>
