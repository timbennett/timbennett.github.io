                <h3>From a self-described ?bogan Rage Against The Machine?, The Nation Blue have become regarded as one of the most intense bands in the country. But it&#8217;s not the only string in frontman Tom Lyngcoln&#8217;s bow. Ahead of a special gig at The Tote this weekend, he talks to <strong>REN? SCHAEFER<em>* about finding restraint with his new outfit Harmony and Hobart&#8217;s seminal noise-rock scene of the ?90s. Harmony photo by *</em>BEN BUTCHER</strong>.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024720/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
The Hobart music scene of the 1990s has been mythologised ever since its protagonists started infiltrating the Mainland, bringing with them a ferocious approach to playing, an uncompromising set of punk attitudes and a DIY spirit that had been lacking in the pampered world of corporate indie rock since the ascendancy of grunge.</p>
<p>Singer and guitarist Tom Lyngcoln was one of the many musicians who made the move to Melbourne as part of a general exodus around the turn of the millennium. Hobart&#8217;s tiny underground music scene had sustained itself in isolation and obscurity for nearly a decade, but eventually being part of such an insular community could no longer satisfy the creative ambitions of most of its bands.</p>
<p>Lyngoln&#8217;s band The Nation Blue had been part of a second wave of Hobart groups, which formed in response to trailblazers such as Mouth, Little Ugly Girls, 50 Million Clowns and Stickmen. Already somewhat out of step with the prevailing sound and philosophy in their hometown, their transition to the Melbourne punk scene was a successful one. The band soon found a new audience here and overseas.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3024726/400x240-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
With Matt Weston on bass and Dan McKay on drums, they remained a solid unit over the next decade, recording an EP and four albums of angry, aggressive rock music that owed very little to any preconceived notions of punk, metal or rock styles. Famed for their fierce live performances and Lyngcoln&#8217;s despairing yet highly politicised lyrical outlook, The Nation Blue are one of the most individualistic bands the punk scene in this country has produced. They are impossible to define and their intensity is hard to convey in words. Their increasingly rare performances often teeter on the edge of chaos, as the rhythm section locks in tightly, allowing Lyngcoln to deploy his sonic guitar noise with complete abandon. His vocals resembling the howls of a wounded animal, the singer often ends up battered and bruised, blood dripping onto his strings.</p>
<p>Such levels of emotional catharsis are hard to sustain, and one outlet Lyngcoln found to express himself in a different way was to form the band Harmony with his wife, drummer Alex Kastaniotis (ex-Remake Remodel). Aided by ex-McLusky bassist Jon Chapple, Harmony take a more restrained, but equally powerful approach to their material. The band is completed by three female vocalists: Maria Kastaniotis, Amanda Roff and Quinn Veldhuis. The trio recall the simultaneous urgency and sweetness of ?60s girl group harmonies, while contributing to a musical cacophony that is decidedly damaged and raw.</p>
<p>While Harmony&#8217;s ramshackle shows and <a href="/releases/2000901">self-titled debut album</a> are garnering a lot of critical attention, The Nation Blue are preparing for a big show as part of The Tote&#8217;s 30th anniversary this Saturday (November 5). The gig will see them reunite with some of their Hobart contemporaries and inspirations such as Little Ugly Girls, Legends Of Motorsport and recent Tasmanian transplants Ivy St. Being able to coax LUGs out of retirement once more is a bit of a scoop for Lyngcoln, who cites the band as one of the main catalysts behind his own involvement in music. Coming full circle in this way provided an excellent starting point to probe into Lyngcoln&#8217;s history.</p>
<h2>?I&#8217;d much rather ape something local?</h2>
<p><strong>You grew up in Tasmania, which must have had an influence on your artistic career. A lot of music that has come out of Tassie since the early ?90s has been fairly dark and intense. Do you have any theories of why that is?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s probably the ecology of the place. The environment is pretty harsh down there. I don&#8217;t want to trivialise it by calling it a rugged outpost, but some parts of Tasmania are pretty uninhabitable. It breeds an insular outlook. There are people living in the hills who have never been to Hobart, even though it&#8217;s only 30 kilometres down the road. </p>
<p>Personally, when I started playing music, I found a group of people whose output was fairly dark and harsh. My first musical experience was going to see Fugazi in 1993. At that point I had had no previous exposure to any local music. The first thing I saw when I walked into this old hall they were playing at was Little Ugly Girls, who were the support band. They were just crushingly heavy. Then Mouth played after them, and they were just ferocious. I had never seen or heard music like that. I had grown up listening to hair metal and that kind of shit, but had slowly progressed into punk. I went home after that gig and put on Fugazi and other records that I had, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything that was as heavy and intense as Mouth. There was a weight behind the music that had nothing to do with notes and chords. </p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SsKmLenZxvs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>I really do think it&#8217;s tied in with the environment down there. Maybe it&#8217;s because the place is so conservative. When people create art down there, it&#8217;s done in order to provoke a reaction from people. It&#8217;s oppositional and reactionary all the way. It&#8217;s a confrontational type of music, which is bleak and heavy at times, and this can be seen in their attitude towards mainland bands as well.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s an interesting point. Many Tasmanian musicians I have talked to have mentioned that they were reacting against the bands that were popular on the mainland. People seemed to embrace an extreme individualism.</strong><br/>
There was always that complete rejection. I never came across bands that wanted to be like the things that they had heard, although I&#8217;m sure that existed as well. There were a few mainland bands that were accepted. People would go and see S:Bahn and Budd when they came down, but whenever a triple j band toured, they would be playing to an empty room. </p>
<p><strong>It sounds like there was a strong sense of community between bands and audiences in Hobart.</strong><br/>
I experienced that community right from the start. I met Andy Hazel, who was playing with Matt Hills and Duncan Haig and a few others in a band called Droplet. I went to see them with my dad at the Wheatsheaf [Hotel]. That&#8217;s where I first came across that community. It was something that I was instantly enamored with. It had never even occurred to me that there might be people making music locally, other than cover bands. Right away I was desperate to be part of that. It was life or death for me. </p>
<p><strong>Were you already writing and playing at that point?</strong><br/>
Yeah, my parents forced me to play piano from a very young age, and I learned music theory at piano school. The son of the woman who ran the school played drums in The Philistines, and they had a poster of the band up on the wall, in among all the pictures of Beethoven and Schubert. I was completely fixated on that poster, just looking at it all the time for six years or so, until I finally asked my teacher who this band was. This photo of these long-haired hippie musicians was probably what derailed me at an early age.</p>
<p>I stopped playing piano around the age of 10. I had been asking to be taught blues and jazz instead of classical music, and eventually I picked up the guitar and kept playing that until I finally found an outlet in the local music community. Eventually, I went to Hobart College, where I met a lot of people who were involved in music, like Sean Bailey, through whom I joined Headcleaner. That was the first band I played in. Then I started a band called Vertigo 3. The bass player also played in Headcleaner and we found another guy who played drums. Eventually we got Dan McKay in and became The Nation Blue.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024723/440x660-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>What sort of music were you inspired by at the time?</strong><br/>
Mostly just the other Hobart bands. All I ever wanted to do was sing like Linda J and play guitar like Bean [both of Little Ugly Girls], or Tim Evans [Mouth, Sea Scouts]. I&#8217;d much rather ape something local. I&#8217;m not saying we achieved it. We probably sounded more like a bogan Rage Against The Machine; pretty woeful really. Those guys were a little older and had decent record collections. We were still pretty ignorant at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Ignorance can be good when you&#8217;re trying to come up with something original.</strong><br/>
There definitely was no inclination towards fads. I only found that out when I moved to Melbourne, where people would stop doing one thing and pick up on something else that was becoming popular. I noticed those seismic shifts in the community here, where people would actually follow what was popular, often to their detriment. The thing with playing for five years to the same 50 people [in Hobart], was that you had to stay the course and just keep doing what you were doing. You could progress and change, but you couldn&#8217;t chase fame.</p>
<p><strong>As a songwriter, how did you develop your style and the kind of topics you were dealing with in The Nation Blue?</strong><br/>
Looking back at the kind of things we were doing while we lived in Hobart, I feel like it was pretty terrible. I never really wanted to be a singer, but the brutal reality was that somebody in the band had to sing. Apart from Linda J and a couple of other people who were actually dedicated singers, most people in the scene were instrumentalists who were also forced to sing and write lyrics. It was born of necessity. Even though I was quite fixated on words and language, my early lyrics were just nonsensical rubbish. It wasn&#8217;t until I moved to Melbourne that I thought it was probably important to write words that weren&#8217;t phonetic transcriptions of murmurings. I like to write, but it&#8217;s more of a recent thing. It still frustrates me sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>The lyrics in The Nation Blue and Harmony are very specific kind of stories though, with recurring themes running through them.</strong><br/>
Early Nation Blue songs were very concerned with the environment. That all came from living in Hobart, and the constant tension between the local community and the logging industry. In a way, it was like the Cold War was for kids in the ?80s. I was completely preoccupied with old growth logging and issues like that, so that was reflected in the lyrics. The other thing that interests me are mainland portrayals of Tasmanians. I say it reluctantly, but there are elements of truth to those stereotypes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes, working for seven years in a paper mill down there. It was a difficult thing to do for someone who is environmentally minded, but unemployment was really high. I saw a lot of people fulfilling Tassie stereotypes in that job. A lot of it was pretty confronting, but it gave me a lot of material to write about and some of that has stayed with me. Over here, people live in a bit of a vacuum. I don&#8217;t want to sing about cars and jeans and girls, so I often revert back to Tassie small town politics. </p>
<p><strong>Is it important to you that people pick up on what your lyrical concerns are?</strong><br/>
At first, I was worried that people might pick up on what the lyrics were about. I had reservations precisely because of those small town politics. You don&#8217;t really want people to shine a light on what you&#8217;re saying, but at the same time I was putting it out there and documenting it and putting my name to it. Every time it comes to printing lyrics, I generally don&#8217;t want to do it and try to find ways around it, but it was almost seen as mandatory in the punk and hardcore scenes that we ended up being associated with. For some reason they are just obsessed with printing lyrics.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Even though I was quite fixated on words and language, my early lyrics were just nonsensical rubbish.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What was the reaction to The Nation Blue in Hobart?</strong><br/>
Complete indifference, really. It was pretty hard to be an engaging band in that kind of environment. We played with Sea Scouts a bit, and we played with Stickmen a lot. We got along with those guys really well, but we were completely unsuited to that scene. There is this genius article that [Hobart music critic] Andrew Harper once wrote about what all the local bands wished to be and what they actually were. He said that we wanted to be some kind of math rock band, but actually were Voivod. [<em>Laughs</em>] I guess we did alright, but as we eventually grew restless and started thinking about moving to the mainland, we played with more interstate bands, like Ricaine, Womnal, Budd and Bloodduster, and ended up becoming friends. Some of those bands were relatively well received in Hobart.</p>
<p>It was a time when a lot of bands were leaving Hobart and eventually we did too. There was no way anyone could be career minded down there, and in a way that was the beauty of it. There was no industry down there and the scene remained completely untouched. There was no chance anybody could make any money. There wasn&#8217;t exactly a local [scene] police who would cut you down if you reached too far, but you just had to do things with some reasonable taste, which was pretty hard to do for a band that sounded like Voivod. I remember someone arguing once that actually putting out CDs was selling out.</p>
<p><strong>Some bands recorded and released CDs though, and there were great initiatives like Mess Fest and the Fear Of Children label.</strong><br/>
There wasn&#8217;t much though. [Mouth&#8217;s] Victim Chant (1994) was probably the first CD that emerged. People would have a crack at it, but the boxes of records would just sit under their bed and that was it. I mean, who the fuck were they going to promote to? There were never merch desks at gigs. People only took notice when some of these bands filtered through to the mainland. Suddenly there were all these harsh Tasmanian bands. There were a few tapes floating around and there were heaps of recordings done. I recorded Stickmen, and there were a few other people who recorded them, but these recordings were never properly released. That was a frustrating thing, but it&#8217;s easy to say that with hindsight. At the time, people just gave each other tapes. </p>
<h2>?We were just wrong on every level?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024722/440x651-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Was your move to the mainland motivated by an ambition to achieve more?</strong><br/>
No, the scene just died out. It ground to a halt, because there were only a few people left. Linda J and [LUGs drummer] Sloth moved away and that was a major catalyst. Myself and Dan gravitated towards Sloth a lot. We&#8217;d helped him organise festivals and skate parks. Tim Evans had gone too. Sean Bailey had been one of the first people to move over to drum in Mindsnare and then he played in Vivian Girls. </p>
<p><strong>When The Nation Blue moved to Melbourne, was it like starting all over?</strong><br/>
We had done one tour of the mainland in ?98, where we played with bands that we knew, like Ricaine and Warped. It was like starting over though, because we lost our bass player. Andy didn&#8217;t want to move, which was fine and understandable. At that point we probably lost a bit of that Tassie harshness. We came back to that in later years, though.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you lose that harshness?</strong><br/>
I think we just got ground down, living in Melbourne. It was a pretty rude shock at first. I hadn&#8217;t really seen a music industry before, and it caught me by surprise. At first I got angry, then I gave in to it, and then I got angry again. For a while I got apathetic and didn&#8217;t want to do it anymore. It was a huge shift for us. Down there, people played because they just wanted to do it, but here &#8211; I still have no fucking idea why people play music here. I mean, there was a bit of a popularity contest happening in Hobart too, but over here it is a lot more blatant and full on.</p>
<p>There are shit bands wherever you go, in Hobart as well, and we were a shit band in Hobart amongst a lot of genius bands. Playing alongside fantastic bands like 50 Million Clowns made us lift our game, but we were still just a polished turd compared to bands like that. Coming over here felt like you have spent all this time avoiding the shit aspects [of the music scene] and suddenly you have to face it and deal with it. It was even more confrontational than playing to a bunch of rednecks down there.</p>
<p><strong>Were the audiences who came to see you on the mainland the same kind of people who&#8217;d see you in Tassie?</strong><br/>
Not at all, because there weren&#8217;t really any subcultures in Hobart. There were some goths and punk kids, but it was such a small community that everyone hung out together. The scene was less than 100 people. Here there is a massive population with clearly defined subcultures and social strata, so we ended up slotting into the punk and hardcore scene. They blindly accepted us for whatever kind of angle they found in us. </p>
<p><strong>What do you think that angle was?</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t know. I cut all my hair off at one point, and I remember [grindcore vocalist] Pete Hyde coming up to me at a show and asking ?Why did you cut your hair off? It&#8217;s a real shame. You guys are so wrong on every level.? I think that sums it up &#8211; we were just wrong on every level. I think being wrong is a good thing. We lost some of our anger and furiousness. It&#8217;s not easy to retain that without developing cancer. You have to find different ways to manifest that.</p>
<p><strong>What prompted the shift from the kind of music you were playing with The Nation Blue to your work with Harmony?</strong><br/>
I had been playing in The Nation Blue for 13 or 14 years, but I&#8217;d occasionally done other projects. When I first moved over I played with Mike Noga (The Drones) for a bit and I&#8217;d played in Lee Memorial. After such a long time of playing emo music it was tainted a bit for me. It was just perpetuating something that was kind of frustrating for me in its abject shit-ness. I really struggled with it.</p>
<p><strong>The Nation Blue were hardly an emo band though.</strong><br/>
Cameron Stops told me that when Mouth first came over, they were described as an emo band. Obviously, the term had different connotations in the mid-?90s, but it&#8217;s definitely something that stuck with us throughout our time over here. </p>
<p><strong>To me, that kind of pigeonholing misses the point of the music.</strong><br/>
Well, we ended up playing with a bunch of bands that fit that category. It&#8217;s not just easy pigeonholing &#8211; it&#8217;s probably pretty accurate. After years and years of writing in a particular way, it was really just five or 10 percent of what I was writing overall. I really wanted to play music which had less of a physical imperative. It really fucking hurts to play in The Nation Blue. It&#8217;s taxing on a lot of levels. Harmony provided a good way of scaling that back a little bit. My ears were fucked and it was impacting on my health. I like just playing the guitar sometimes, without the piss and vinegar and the Tasmanian pyrotechnics. </p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p><strong>Harmony is not necessarily less intense though, just intense in a different way.</strong><br/>
I didn&#8217;t intend the band to be so dramatic. I think there&#8217;s something wrong with me, that it always comes out this way. I can&#8217;t help it. That&#8217;s just the valve that gets turned on every time I sit down with a guitar. I think it&#8217;s due to years of conditioning in Hobart. I have a desire to retain that outlook for as long as I can, before I completely start to suck. I&#8217;m just trying to stay the course, basically. </p>
<p><strong>Does it surprise you how positive the reaction to Harmony has been?</strong><br/>
I thought more people would be laughing, because I think it&#8217;s a pretty funny concept, but the positive reaction is nice. Whenever you do something new, there is always a brief period where people are interested to check it out. That wanes and dies, but that&#8217;s fine. You have to enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Did a similar thing happen with appreciation of The Nation Blue?</strong><br/>
Definitely. After a while there is always a decline of interest. It happens with all bands. If you study your own patterns of music consumption, you find that there is a frenzied period of being completely obsessed with a band and then it wanes a bit. We were lucky that we got to play to a consistent amount of people throughout the years, but that&#8217;s mainly because we didn&#8217;t play that much. This year we only played Melbourne a couple of times and next year I can&#8217;t see much happening at all. People in the band have other interests.</p>
<h2>?We painted ourselves into a corner?</h2>
<p><strong>What side of you is Harmony an outlet for?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s the 90 percent of material that doesn&#8217;t get an airing in The Nation Blue. That was the impetus for the band. Listening back to tapes of songs that I&#8217;d written, it was frustrating that they were just sitting there. I write a lot, and quite frequently, and I found that there was a whole other angle emerging in that material, which I wanted to do something with. So I started to write specifically for that angle.</p>
<p>The Nation Blue have a few quieter, more refined songs, but people tend to go to the bar when we play them. It&#8217;s just an opportunity for them to have a chat. I feel like we painted ourselves into a corner with the piss and vinegar stage show. People expect a certain level of intensity. I&#8217;ve been smashing myself in the face for 10 years and it loses its appeal. It&#8217;s hard to mean it as much after such a long time. </p>
<p>In the past 12 months, it&#8217;s probably had a lot more intensity again than it did for the four previous years. We came back after considering ending it and we got a lot more passionate about it again. We needed time off to find that passion and anger again, because the music requires a certain amount of rage. </p>
<p>The last Nation Blue album <em><a href="/releases/2000371">Rising Waters</a> [2009] certainly bears that out.*</em><br/>
That album was written in the same way that we used to work in the early days in Hobart. I still think there is a lot of potential for the band to do things, but at the moment I&#8217;m more obsessed with Harmony. I enjoy playing with new people. My [lyrical] preoccupations are still the same. It can drive the people around me crazy. I can bottom out and get really depressed, but when I see something fucked, I&#8217;ll write about it.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>With Harmony, there was an idea that I can continue to write lyrics in the way that I have always done, but with a different musical approach. I&#8217;ve always been obsessed with the way <a href="/articles/3609057">Gareth Edwards</a> [Corners, The Holy Rose, Sandro] writes lyrics. He can say these horrendous things and express them in a really beautiful way. I like that cheap magic trick, where you show somebody something, but you&#8217;re really giving them something completely different. That kind of deception is alluring. I try to do that with Harmony, right down to the band name.</p>
<p><strong>How did that concept for Harmony form in your mind?</strong><br/>
I started writing songs with Alex [Kastaniotis] and always had the intention of turning this into a band. I knew that I wanted something vocal-heavy, so the first person I talked to was Amanda [Roff, of The Ukeladies]. I wanted to do less singing and more guitar playing. It didn&#8217;t really pan out that way, because I was still left with a lot of the vocal duties while I was writing. I&#8217;d have ideas and would have to try them out myself, but I had no idea what the three girls? approach would be. </p>
<p>It became a whole other thing, because they are all classically trained. When they got into the room together, they started to communicate in this alien language. I had chosen to forget about all the theory and technical elements of music a long time ago. I just put my hands on the fretboard and strum open strings to get some sounds out of the guitar. They did the complete opposite, where everything was really clinical. They had intervals and chords and all these things that they came up with together. It ended up being quite complex.</p>
<p><strong>Do they respond to the music the band has written, or are they involved in shaping the songs?</strong><br/>
It is reactionary, probably because I stand there like a dictator and enforce a view. I wanted to avoid the diva element, in any sense. I wanted to use it more like another instrument, rather than highlighting the pyrotechnics of the vocals. I didn&#8217;t want the technical elements of the singing to overshadow the simplicity of the songs. It ended up working, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>It almost seems like a clash of styles, but ends up gelling in a magical way.</strong><br/>
The first time they put something down, I was instantly a fan. It was quite impressive. I was happy with the slow, droney quality of the songs before the girls actually started to sing. They didn&#8217;t change the songs, because they were already written, but now I&#8217;m starting to write songs with those weapons in mind. They added a completely new range of elements to work with. It&#8217;s really liberating after so many years in a bass-drums-guitar-singer band. It&#8217;s great to have this fresh set of tools to use, and it&#8217;s given me a second wind.</p>

<h2>?Hit it the way you are?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3024721/441x440-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>I&#8217;m interested in the fact that you recorded the album before you had actually played live. It seems like the band has developed a lot since then.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s still developing. In the first six months there were some pretty sketchy moments, but I love that too. I love mistakes in music. That&#8217;s the kind of stuff that makes me engage with music the most. Complete ineptitude is one of my favourite things. There was nobody down in Hobart who was a technical genius, so I threw away every thought of technical proficiency once I hit that scene. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always embraced. I tried to develop a raw personification of who I am when I play an instrument &#8211; just hit it the way you are. It&#8217;s funny to employ something that is so technical in Harmony, against something that is fundamentally primitive. The music is stripped back as much as possible. For some reason it gels alright. </p>
<p><strong>Alex&#8217;s drumming is quite amazing, in that it is really simple, but impactful.</strong><br/>
She hates anything that is superfluous. She is clinical in every aspect of life. If it doesn&#8217;t have a purpose, fuck it off. It was interesting &#8211; after years of being together, I had no idea if playing in a band together was going to work. It&#8217;s not a style of music that she gives a shit about. It was a bit daunting at first. Up until that point we had no engagement at all on a musical level. Then we played at my dad&#8217;s 60th birthday, with my flatmate Chris. We did some songs by The Band and Wilco for my old man, and that was the first time we played together. Prior to that, our relationship wasn&#8217;t about music, which was unfortunate because for me everything is about music. </p>
<p>I was frustrated that she had quit playing drums, because I used to love Remake Remodel. When I first saw them, when they were still Porcelain, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it was music that would have any staying power with me, but I ended up loving it. Then she got sick of playing the drums and quit. I think that&#8217;s unusual for a musician, because they tend to cling to it and try to wring some life out of playing in a band, even if they&#8217;re not enjoying it anymore. It was a pretty brutal executive decision, but it was nice to bring her back from that. The musical side of Harmony we don&#8217;t talk about at all. We just smash it out and do it. The administrative side of it we talk about a lot. It&#8217;s fucking hard to organise six people at times. </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s really interesting about Harmony is the contrast between the roughness of your voice and the sweetness of the girls? singing. How do you think that will develop in the new material you are writing?</strong><br/>
The last six months have taught us that it&#8217;s quite hard to do live. That kind of dichotomy is difficult to foster, because you&#8217;ve got three people who really need to hear everything that they&#8217;re doing, and then you&#8217;ve got this raucous mess behind them. Sometimes we [the band] make it impossible for them to do it. I saw Leonard Cohen a while ago and I was really struck by how quietly he played. There is a lot of power to that and I think we have to embrace that. </p>
<blockquote><p>?I don&#8217;t want to sing about cars and jeans and girls, so I often revert back to Tassie small town politics.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I would&#8217;ve thought you had a bit of experience with playing in a more subdued way from being in Lee Memorial.</strong><br/>
No, even that turned into a raging rock band after a while. There might have been acoustic instruments, but towards the end it sounded like Slayer to me. I enjoyed the hell out of that band, but I found myself falling into the same patterns as when I play with The Nation Blue. It was weird performing in that way with that group of people. It&#8217;s almost like muscle memory, after playing in that style for so many years. With Harmony, having Jon [Chapple] from McLusky in the band, it&#8217;s a similar thing. Initially, when he played with us, he&#8217;d feel like he was having a bad show if he wasn&#8217;t jumping around like a maniac, bashing the shit out of his bass. It&#8217;s hard to get used to restraint in the music. </p>
<p><strong>There can be a lot of power generated by quiet music though. It&#8217;s more about tension than bashing people over the head.</strong><br/>
I remember watching Sandro on stage and wondering, as I&#8217;m crying, if they were actually going to play the next note. The tension was almost unbearable before they&#8217;d hit the next chord.</p>
<p><strong>When you play live, is getting a reaction from the audience important?</strong><br/>
I didn&#8217;t think it was until I moved over here and nobody at shows would dance. I used to go out to see bands in Hobart like 50 Million Clowns and everybody would be dancing. Over here, people stand back with their arms folded and study what you do on stage. It&#8217;s kind of alienating. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re playing in East Germany and everybody watches from the other side &#8211; it&#8217;s this massive barrier. I think it&#8217;s absurd to watch music in this way.</p>
<p><strong>But you don&#8217;t know what goes on in people&#8217;s heads. They might be going ?Fuck! This is the greatest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen.?</strong><br/>
I like to see them express those feelings with some physical movement though. I have a lot more fun when people participate in some way, even if they heckle. In Hobart heckling was always mandatory. It still is, actually. When we last played down there, people were dancing and yelling and making comments. I made the mistake of going out into the crowd and somebody kicked me in the arse, threw me on the floor and tried to take my guitar off me. It&#8217;s all friendly sparring, which is entertaining for everyone. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the physical performance aspect in The Nation Blue got more extreme over the years. We couldn&#8217;t get it from the crowd, so we did it to ourselves. If people wanted to be freaked out by a performance, I&#8217;d be happy to give them something to freak out about. I&#8217;d hurt myself, or whatever. We&#8217;ve had a fair few injuries over the years, but of course there are bands that take that GG Allin approach a lot more seriously and actually put themselves in danger. Really, it would be nice if people just had a dance. We just want to be loved. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
