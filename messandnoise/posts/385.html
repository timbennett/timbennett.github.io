                <h3>Is Dirt Child (aka Sydney-based sculptor Belle Brooks) Aus hip-hop&#8217;s finest agent provocateur or just an elaborate prankster? <strong>DOUG WALLEN</strong> finds out.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3008667/440x628-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
How exactly does a sculptor from the NSW country town of Mudgee fall into hip-hop? For Sydney-based Belle Brooks, it began as a joke, but her debut EP as Dirt Child, <em><a href="/releases/2000499">Ratking</a></em>, is too fully formed and sharply executed to be just for a laugh. </p>
<p>Teaming up with manager/producer James Woods, who also raps as Jimmy Suit, Brooks really throws her weight around on the five-song Ratking, spouting lewd boasts while dissecting various targets and stoking surreal imagery. She tackles city nightlife, dwells on testicles, and engages in a reference-heavy flurry of recurring themes. And on <a href="http://dirtchildonya.com">&#8216;Anthem&#8217;</a>, Brooks writes off the vast majority of Aussie hip-hop (?A disaster, a farce, it&#8217;s daft?), naming names along the way. It&#8217;s sure to rub most listeners the wrong way, but beneath Dirt Child&#8217;s bratty posturing is a hunger for smarter, more creative hip-hop that&#8217;s not so beholden to American trends. During a winding phone conversation, Brooks opened up about realising the unlikely project, the challenge of performing live, dissing Macromantics and the fornicating giraffes in her lounge room.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been doing Dirt Child?</strong><br/>
I started messing around with the idea at the end of last year. Then it was like, ?Let&#8217;s go make an EP.? [<em>Laughs</em>]. I wasn&#8217;t really anything musical before that. </p>
<p><strong>Yeah, your background is in sculpture.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s still creative, but it&#8217;s not rapping. And it&#8217;s still absurd. </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re also an ?aquascapist??</strong><br/>
It basically means <a href="http://www.amanotakashi.net/">landscaping] aquariums. It&#8217;s dealing with plants and interesting forms in a little universe. If you look up [Takashi Amano</a>, you&#8217;ll see some amazing work. </p>
<p><strong>I had no idea that was a thing.</strong><br/>
Yeah, everybody always asks. They think I escape from water or something. It&#8217;s a bit nerdy, so it&#8217;s not that exciting. </p>
<p><strong>Are you still at uni?</strong><br/>
No, I&#8217;m done. I finished my honours last year. I did my giraffes and now I&#8217;m a practising artist. Have you seen my sculptures? They&#8217;re big giraffes having sex in multi-coloured plasticine. At the moment they&#8217;re in my lounge room, but they&#8217;ve just been up in Newcastle for this festival and over to Perth. They&#8217;ve been around.</p>
<p><strong>They look quite tall. How did they fit through the door of your lounge room?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] The male&#8217;s head comes off and he detaches from the female. The thing is, you can&#8217;t actually touch the plasticine, because it squishes. So it&#8217;s an absolute nightmare. It&#8217;s this incredibly ridiculous thing. But they&#8217;re fun. </p>
<p><strong>Is that a common material to sculpt in?</strong><br/>
No, it&#8217;s kind of my own technique, I suppose. It&#8217;s more used in stop-motion animation and stuff like that. But they&#8217;re fibreglass underneath.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3008668/440x662-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>Is building a song anything like making a sculpture?</strong><br/>
I probably approach it the same way, in a mad ?put that here, put that there? [way], adding to it and making it bigger and bigger until it&#8217;s some four-metre fucking giraffe or some crazy song that has too many references and strange little parts. In that way it&#8217;s the same. It&#8217;s less physical. I&#8217;m quite little, related to the giraffe, so it&#8217;s quite hard to manage. But with a song it&#8217;s nice and tidy, and you can just send it to your friends. You don&#8217;t have to put it in a truck and transport it around everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Is that one of your sculptures on the EP sleeve?</strong><br/>
Oh, yeah, the laser rat head. [<em>Laughs</em>] That&#8217;s another fibreglass one. That was on a bicycle helmet, so I&#8217;m gonna ride around [wearing it]. </p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a lot of sexuality in your songs. Beyond the giraffes, is there much sexuality in your sculptures?</strong><br/>
Well, it&#8217;s never actually the focus for me. It just creeps its way in. The giraffes aren&#8217;t about them having sex. It&#8217;s just about the absurdity of the whole situation. I suppose with my songs, that happens as well. It crept its way in and it&#8217;s in no way serious. It&#8217;s such hyperbole and so over-the-top that it does become absurd. I quite like that aspect. A lot of people mention the whole sex side, but it&#8217;s not something I did to be shocking. I guess it just happened. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>You mention misogyny in one song and chauvinism in another, and obviously those are glaring elements in most commercial rap.</strong><br/>
The thing is, I&#8217;m quite misogynistic myself, if you listen to my songs. I feel like I&#8217;m quite a hypocrite. </p>
<p><strong>Well, some of the lyrics I thought you were saying through the voices of the people you&#8217;re mocking.</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s bits of that. I suppose it&#8217;s hard to distinguish what&#8217;s what, really, in the whole mash of what it is. </p>
<p><strong>But you weren&#8217;t trying to reverse those elements of rap?</strong><br/>
I wasn&#8217;t really trying to, no, but I suppose I did in that I was a woman rapping. And that&#8217;s unusual. And a woman rapping about those things &#8211; well, it&#8217;s not that unusual. I don&#8217;t know. When men do it, people don&#8217;t seem to notice. </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s an interesting double standard. If Lil? Kim or Amanda Blank raps about sex, it&#8217;s their shtick. But if a man does it, it&#8217;s just him being a man.</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s exactly it. The guy on [ABC] Radio National said that swearing, or having a potty mouth, was my shtick. They&#8217;re just words I use, like you do.</p>
<p><strong>Is it hard writing lyrics?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s just such an incredible amount, and they&#8217;re all so worked over. It&#8217;s not hard, but it&#8217;s quite an intricate process that evolves over time when you find a better rhyme. I talk to James [Woods] and he&#8217;ll come up with something cool. We try to find as many words and syllables that will rhyme as possible. The thing I think most rappers actually struggle with is writing about things. A lot of songs aren&#8217;t really about anything. I think a song should have content, so I try to make my songs say something. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything of worth, but I want them to say something. </p>
<blockquote><p>?I haven&#8217;t really heard any responses from my cheeky disses, but a lot of people hate [Dirt Child], which is quite fantastic.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why hip-hop? It&#8217;s a strange realm to end up in.</strong><br/>
I guess there&#8217;s a few reasons. One, I can&#8217;t sing. Two, I was hearing all this hip-hop. I just think it&#8217;s not very good. Well, I&#8217;ve sort of learnt now it&#8217;s good to the people who like it. [<em>Laughs</em>] I just don&#8217;t find it good at all. It&#8217;s dreary rubbish, really, that&#8217;s only famous or successful because of the songs they sample. I know that&#8217;s a really old argument, and samples in music can be fantastic, but in Australian hip-hop a lot of it just piggybacks on that, I find.</p>
<p><strong>You said you&#8217;ve learnt it&#8217;s good to people who like it. Have you been taken to task much?</strong><br/>
Well, I haven&#8217;t really heard any responses from my cheeky disses, but a lot of people hate [Dirt Child], which is quite fantastic. Coming into this project we thought, ?This [Aussie hip-hop] is terrible music. Let&#8217;s give them something a bit more intellectual and interesting.? And we thought it was that. But they sort of just grunt and say, ?Shut up bitch. Stop squealing.?</p>
<p><strong>Underground hip-hop often has this barrage of ideas, whereas the commercial stuff is kept broad and simple, with as recognisable a sample as possible.</strong><br/>
And it has little merit. But I guess it&#8217;s easy. And I guess it&#8217;s good for [being] in the background.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of people don&#8217;t want to think too much about what they&#8217;re listening to.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m probably the same. I don&#8217;t listen to music very much, but when I do, I don&#8217;t listen to every single word. Looking back, before I rapped, I wouldn&#8217;t have listened to my own songs and picked them apart and got every punch line. I would have been like, ?Yep, she&#8217;s talking fast.? [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>You also call out Macromantics, who&#8217;s much more inventive that most hip-hop acts.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s quite awkward now, because I&#8217;ve befriended some bands who are quite good friends with Macromantics and think she&#8217;s fantastic. But the reason I called her out was because I find that she doesn&#8217;t speak out anything. Her rhymes are complex and really rhythmically great, but it&#8217;s just hippie gibberish to me: ?Apple crumble spider bite.? </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s very much abstraction.</strong><br/>
Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>The other people you diss are some of the standard-bearers of Aussie hip-hop, but James actually defends Drapht and Bliss N Esso on the track</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s right. Drapht is a clever man. He does very well. Bliss N Esso &#8211; I probably don&#8217;t share the same opinion. But there are some good acts in Australian hip-hop. I think The Hilltop Hoods are very clever, and they must be doing something right for so many people to love them, but I find them boring. That&#8217;s why I made rap; so I would have something to listen to. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about Curse Ov Dialect, who are in the opposite direction?</strong><br/>
They&#8217;re quite amazing. They&#8217;ve got a bit of something else. And just their whole presence. </p>

<strong>James has a lot of different roles in Dirt Child: he&#8217;s your manager and producer, he guests on two songs, and he runs the label Climbing Hills. Has he been an equal partner throughout the project?</strong><br/>
Yeah. The whole thing has been the both of us. His beats are amazing, and he sort of acted as a taskmaster. I had no idea how it would go, and we just evolved it from just words to something cool and musical. </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve done a few live shows now, right?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve done three. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>How did they go?</strong><br/>
They&#8217;ve been interesting. I maintain that live rap, unless you&#8217;re Curse Ov Dialect, is really hard to do. But it&#8217;s been quite fun. James is on stage [too]. He plays synths and raps.</p>
<p><strong>Were you billed with other hip-hop acts?</strong><br/>
Well, the first gig I ever did was with Quan from Regurgitator, his solo project. So that was quite intimidating. He&#8217;s quite big. The second one was with [Melbourne hip-hop collective] Keith! Party. That was probably the best one. The third one was at Pony [in Melbourne]. It was right after this thrash-y, death-metal band. It was the worst performance I&#8217;ve done, but it was amazing in that it was so bad. </p>
<p><strong>Given the sheer amount of words, do you have trouble remembering them or keeping your breath live?</strong><br/>
I had incredible trouble when I first started. I could not get these words out. They&#8217;re quite complex things that go up and down. But through recording them and practising, I learnt them and learnt where to breathe and what to do with this massive chunk of text I had to regurgitate. </p>
<p><strong>Is it just the five songs from <em>Ratking</em> when you rap live?</strong><br/>
Well, I have two sort of half-songs. One&#8217;s over ?I&#8217;m The Slime?, the Zappa song, and the other&#8217;s over ?A Milli?, the Lil? Wayne song. So I drop them in there. We make it all join together with James? musical interludes. We have the <em>Ship To Shore</em> theme in there. </p>
<p><strong>Is there an album you&#8217;re working on?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m not working on anything Dirt Child-related at the moment, but I have these ideas for a double-disc EP. I guess it will really crystallise what Dirt Child is and what I&#8217;m doing with it. <em>Ratking</em> is the first five songs I ever made in my life. </p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether this was an one-off thing or the start of something more.</strong><br/>
The whole project started off as a joke and grew and grew as a bad joke might. But then it became very serious all of a sudden. I feel like an idiot quoting myself, but in [?Golden Tooth?] I say, ?I&#8217;m not a rapper, bitch, I make sculptures, fuck ya/Yeah, get a bit of culture up ya.? I looked around and there were posters with my face on them. That really freaked me out [that] I&#8217;m being seen as a rapper and not as an artist. </p>
<p><strong>It does say in your bio that you&#8217;re a sculptor.</strong><br/>
I wanted to keep that in. I hate probably 99 percent of performance art, so I don&#8217;t want it to be seen as some performance art project or social experiment. But I put a lot of effort and a lot myself in it. It does definitely have that element of art [but] because it started as a joke, there&#8217;s still elements of that in there. So it could go either way.</p>
