                <h3><strong>ADAM D MILLS</strong> sits down for a chat with Sydney-based electronic/drone artist Paul Gough (aka Pimmon), who recently ended a long period of silence with &#8216;Smudge Another Yesterday&#8217;, his darkest and most personal album to date.

<strong>Things have been pretty quiet on the Pimmon front lately. What happened? You used to be so prolific.</strong><br/>
I tend to work like this: I hit this point where it&#8217;s like an explosion, and I literally will spend a couple of years doing stuff every night. Not to say that it&#8217;s all gold, but there&#8217;ll be a fairly high hit rate of stuff I&#8217;ll put away in a box. I&#8217;ve got several boxes like this with sketches or ideas or parts of tracks that eventually will become something else. So what happened was I hit a point in about 2003 where I just stopped. And that&#8217;s for lots of reasons. One is that I&#8217;m very much still a consumer; it&#8217;s getting more and more of an obsession. I&#8217;m just really, really loving my music at the moment. So I got to this point where I felt I didn&#8217;t want to keep contributing, I just wanted to stop and have a listen for a while. I also think that I hit a bit of an emotional brick wall and I just didn&#8217;t feel like doing it for that reason. It all gets very complex. </p>
<p>Often I&#8217;ll say to my partner, ?That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s the end of Pimmon.? She&#8217;ll just start laughing, and she&#8217;ll say, ?What, again?? It&#8217;s not that I dislike doing it, [but] at times it&#8217;s a struggle. I think fundamentally I&#8217;m really quite self-deprecating when it comes to my music. It&#8217;s a struggle for me to come to terms with the fact that somebody would like to listen to it. Which probably sounds weird, given that I&#8217;m quite happy to put it out. The issue for me is marketing. I hate all that. That&#8217;s not the kind of person I am. I feel like I&#8217;m showing off. So I think part of stopping was a part of me saying, ?Come on, what are you doing? This is nuts.?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s the old art-versus-commerce quandary: how to get the word out to people without turning into a salesman. You can&#8217;t just sit back and do nothing, otherwise nobody&#8217;s going to know your music exists.</strong><br/>
Exactly. That&#8217;s the dual edge of that sword. I think for me, having for many years done things, I just got to a point where I was like, ?Is there actually someone who would buy this? Is there actually someone who might like it or understand it?? And that curiosity is probably the closest to a sense of ego that I have, that kind of questioning of whether what you do has some kind of validity. And maybe that fundamentally is something we all want to know: ?Do I have some kind of mark to make?? I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily a bad question to ask. I guess there&#8217;s still that sense of wonder. It&#8217;s been 10 years now, is it still valid? So that&#8217;s the interesting thing with this new release [<em>Smudge Another Yesterday</em>]. It was something I really needed to release, in a way. When it finally fell into place, it was a cathartic unblocking. Since that point of it coming out it&#8217;s been kind of a rebirth in a strange way. I felt the urge again.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I think fundamentally I&#8217;m really quite self-deprecating when it comes to my music. It&#8217;s a struggle for me to come to terms with the fact that somebody would like to listen to it.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is the material on <em>Smudge Another Yesterday</em> all new stuff, or did you dig back into that box of ideas you mentioned?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a lot of old stuff in there, but it&#8217;s all been reworked. One of my sons has always been pretty keen on being involved in naming tracks. He&#8217;s come out with some pretty bizarre ones. Not so much recently; this is years ago. I think it was probably just after [2003?s Snaps<em>Crackles*Pops] came out that he said, ?I&#8217;ve got a really good title for a song &#8211; ?Evil Household Ceremony.?? He would have been six at the time. And I just sat there and thought, ?Where has this come from?? I wrote it down on a piece of paper. And then I just started working on [the song] and I had pretty much the version that&#8217;s on *Smudge</em>. So that&#8217;s quite an old track that was always going to be a part of the album. </p>
<p><strong>Do you remember when you first decided to begin work on a new album?</strong><br/>
Probably the thing that really started the album off is the first track ?Come Join the Choir Invisible?, which has a very un-Pimmon-like sound. That came about during the quiet period. I was actually working then, but in a different way. A friend of mine was making a film that I contributed to the soundtrack for. A lot of the stuff I did ended up being more atmospherics. It&#8217;s a very dark movie, sort of a black comedy but very dark. This was an outtake from some suggestions I had for him. I&#8217;d misplaced this particular disc and I was just scooting through having a bit of a listen. When it came on, my first thought was, ?Why did I put on something I must have found somewhere else?? I had no memory of doing it. As I sat and listened I realised that I had actually made it even though I had little to no recollection of it. And as I listened to it I had this flashback to one of the darkest moments in my life, and it floored me. It unlocked this emotional door. I thought, ?That&#8217;s the start.? It gave me an idea of using my music for the first time ever as a way of starting on a new path. So that was a pivotal track for me.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3004701/440x660-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>It&#8217;s a very dark record, especially in comparison to your earlier work.</strong><br/>
It was really interesting. When it came time to do the artwork for the release, I was speaking to Mark from Preservation [Records]. He spoke about it being this organic work, and the initial idea was to have a circle [on the cover]. He told me what he felt and I said, ?I&#8217;m really interested that you picked that up when you listened to it because to be honest it&#8217;s about imperfection. It&#8217;s not about a perfect circle, it&#8217;s about something that&#8217;s dark and rotten and not right.? So you&#8217;re right in suggesting that it&#8217;s a dark release. It&#8217;s me going through some processes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think it&#8217;s a mood you&#8217;ll continue to explore?</strong><br/>
No, that&#8217;s been dealt with. That&#8217;s where it&#8217;s been great. The album is kind of in two halves. I don&#8217;t want it to sound corny or cliched, but the first five tracks are the struggle, and the last three tracks, while they might still sound dark, actually aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re a moving on kind of thing. But certainly the first five tracks are dealing with issues. I don&#8217;t know if people will even pick up that there&#8217;s a difference, but certainly from my perspective that&#8217;s how it is. And that&#8217;s the hard thing about doing music, that you really don&#8217;t know what the listener is going to perceive. I can&#8217;t guarantee that people are going to get what I mean, but I don&#8217;t necessarily think that I want them to feel a particular thing. And that&#8217;s why to me, knowing what it really means is not important. But as far as me as an artist goes, I guess it has been the catalyst to allow me to move on.</p>
