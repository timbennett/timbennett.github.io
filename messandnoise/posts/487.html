                <h3>What does it take to run one of Australia&#8217;s largest festivals? At a public forum on day one of last weekend&#8217;s Splendour In The Grass, co-founders Paul Piticco and Jessica Ducrou gave punters a unique insight into how they pull it off.

<strong>How did Splendour come about in the first place? Why did it happen?</strong><br/>
Paul: We got together on the idea of ?we should do a little festival?. Boutique, start out small, something different. A camping event. We came to the conclusion that it was probably best to avoid the competition and summer traffic, and do it somewhere that people would like to escape to in the winter. And that was Byron Bay. That was 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your vision for the future of Splendour?</strong><br/>
Jess: Part of the reason for our move to Woodford is that it&#8217;s allowed us to steer the festival in a direction that&#8217;s quite different from Belongil Fields, and much closer to our vision, which is a camping festival. Ideally, we&#8217;d like to camp everyone on-site. The format this year is that gates open at 4pm on Thursday and don&#8217;t close until 12pm [on Monday]. You&#8217;re creating a city; your own experience. We weren&#8217;t able to do that at Belongil Fields, as we didn&#8217;t have the space to do it. It&#8217;s pretty satisfying being here now, and seeing where the festival has come, 10 years down the track.</p>
<p>Paul: Jess and I have had this ambition: we are fans, and have been patrons of the great festivals of the world: the Glastonburys, the Coachellas, and so many great camping events around the world. We didn&#8217;t really think that Australia had one. Our aspirations are to build an event that&#8217;s of that global standard. Something that Australia can hold up as its globally-recognised festival. That&#8217;s another thing that we&#8217;re aiming to get to &#8211; and we think we get a little closer every year.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m wondering about the numbers. What capacity did you have 10 years ago, and now, is it like a ?big Australia? policy? Or do you have a good level of people now?</strong><br/>
Paul: The first year was 7500. There was a little bit of a joke among the international agents and booking community. When we were starting out, not everybody knew us, but they were like, ?Oh, you&#8217;re the festival that sold out, but still lost money!? [<em>Laughs</em>] That&#8217;s what happened in year one, because we weren&#8217;t very good at budgeting, obviously. We sold all our tickets and went, ?Shit, we don&#8217;t have enough money to pay bills.? It started out at 7500, and I think I&#8217;ll let Jess take the second part of the question.</p>
<p>Jess: I guess there&#8217;s a financial reality that what we&#8217;re hoping to present [that] costs money. All of the different areas that we&#8217;ve brought to this particular site cost money. The only way we can afford to pay for that is through ticket sales. But there has to be a good balance between economics and an experience for those coming to the show. There&#8217;s certainly been times at Belongil Fields where we&#8217;ve had crowd flow issues, and a general sense from people that there&#8217;s too many people at the show. We&#8217;ve tried to reassess that in the following years. We might try and tighten up our guest-list, and try and open up more space. So there&#8217;s ways to do that. It&#8217;s very difficult once you set a precedent, in terms of what you&#8217;re doing with a festival, to move the costs backwards. The reality is, the show will suffer if you start reeling in the costs.</p>
<p><strong>So you can only get bigger?</strong><br/>
Jess: No, but I&#8217;d have to say our vision in the long-term is to develop a program. And by developing the program, you&#8217;ll have to pay for it, so there&#8217;ll be more people. I think the festival really is at about 50 percent of where we see it, and I don&#8217;t mean that in terms of capacity, but in terms of what we want to present. We want to have different musical genres. We&#8217;d like it to appeal to people between the ages of six to 60. We&#8217;ve started upgrading the kids area; we want there to be a kids festival. All of that costs money.</p>
<p>Paul: To touch on it, too, a lot of people primarily come here for the four or five particular acts, but it&#8217;s this, [the forum] that we&#8217;re doing right now. This isn&#8217;t a revenue raiser. This isn&#8217;t something that takes money out of your pocket. These are the kinds of things that we see increasing the vitality of the event, like Jess said. If you&#8217;re a parent, or will hopefully one day have the pleasure to be, we&#8217;ll have a giant kids area. That&#8217;s something we want to grow. We want to grow the forum; this is the first year we&#8217;ve had it. We&#8217;ll watch this over the weekend and if it&#8217;s great, we&#8217;ll grow it. These things cost [money]. A lot of people work this show 300 days of the year. For your three days of enjoyment, there&#8217;s 300 days of wages to pay. We try to keep that fine balance between expanding the vision, but maintaining the amount of people we need &#8211; and the ticket price &#8211; to keep it relevant.</p>

<p><strong>How many thousand do you have this year?</strong><br/>
Paul and Jess [<em>simultaneously</em>]: 32.</p>
<p><strong>Is that about what you&#8217;re comfortable with? What about 40,000 [next year]?</strong><br/>
Paul: It&#8217;s hard. We don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s one of those things where, usually, Jess and I will sit down, have an argument over a vision, then we&#8217;ll work back form the vision until we hit a budget. Sometimes those things get shot down, sometimes we go, ?You know, that&#8217;s doable.? So just saying an arbitrary figure &#8211; ?will you have 40,000 next year?? &#8211; is irrelevant, because we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to add, or what we&#8217;re going to expand.</p>
<p>Jess: We also need to see this show happening here for a few days, to have an opinion on how well this space can cope with what we&#8217;ve done this year. It&#8217;s definitely an intention for us to keep it intimate. That&#8217;s one great thing about this site, with all its different areas, to a degree there&#8217;s intimacy there. At the same time, you need a space to present the big acts, so that everyone can see them if they want to. We don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ll do next year. We&#8217;re just going to try and get through this weekend.</p>
<p>Paul: We&#8217;ll likely be here next year. For 2012, we&#8217;re not sure yet.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to know a bit more about why you&#8217;ve come to Woodford from Byron this year. Why did you move? what are some of the politics behind it?</strong><br/>
Jess: There were two reasons for the move. This venue gave us the opportunity to present the show in a format that we wanted. In Byron, there&#8217;s currently not anywhere we can do that. And we also had the instant support of Bill Hauritz, the director of the Woodford Folk Festival, and the council, which was very appealing. And the other reason for the move was in reaction to a draft events policy that Byron Council were creating, which was going to limit the size, length and location of events [in Byron]. We were already feeling like we&#8217;d outgrown Belongil, and we really wanted to present some new areas for the show. It was more about survival.</p>
<p>Paul: Space was one of the primary concerns. Returning to the previous question about having an expansive vision, we simply ran out of room at Belongil Fields.</p>
<p><strong>Paul, are you a perfectionist? If so, how do you deal with all of the stress that&#8217;s involved with running a function of this size?</strong><br/>
Paul: I would say that we&#8217;re both very driven to detail. Jess has a different set of criteria to me, but the visual image of the festival is definitely more her bag &#8211; How do I deal with stress? I&#8217;ve got a pretty stressful job. I run a record label [Dew Process], I do this, and I manage bands [including Powderfinger]. Between all that, I just &#8211; let it go over. I just do what I can, and try not to freak out too much. Occasionally I fail, and have a meltdown, but generally I just make a list, try to smile through it, tick boxes and plow through. Otherwise, I don&#8217;t really know. Take multivitamins, they&#8217;re very good for you.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any good goss you can hit us with about people who&#8217;ve absolutely left you floundering, where you&#8217;ve just gone, ?Never again??</strong><br/>
Paul: We were very disappointed with Jane&#8217;s Addiction not showing [in 2009]. We caught Whitley with a golf buggy out on the main road. He was very drunk. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever been let down catastrophically by anyone. Let&#8217;s just say there&#8217;s almost too many to mention. You add 30,000-odd people, a thousand artists, three days of drinking, fun and food, and people do silly things. Nothing immediately comes to mind. I&#8217;ll come back to you if I think of anything.</p>
<p><strong>On a more positive and less gossipy note, what are some of the bands that stand out as highlights?</strong><br/>
Paul: Was it two years ago that Band Of Horses first played? [<em>Audience confirms</em>] When they played ?Funeral?, that was probably the highlight and the lowlight for one particular song at the festival. I was so moved and emotional, I started to well up. That was the highlight, obviously. The lowlight was watching a lot of the road crew looking at me going, ?What the hell is he crying about?? I was just standing there, crying. That was a great moment.</p>
<p>I was very proud the first time that Coldplay played [in 2003]. That was a coup for us, considering the size of festival we were at the time. The Grates have always had great sets here. I&#8217;ve always enjoy watching them.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We were already feeling like we&#8217;d outgrown Belongil, and we really wanted to present some new areas for the show. It was more about survival.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jess: The Flaming Lips last year was pretty awesome. Sigur R&#8217;s [in 2008] was a very left-field performance. We took a bit of a risk by putting them so high up the bill, on the main stage, as not a lot of people know their stuff. But it was such a phenomenal moment. I felt very proud of us. We did something that&#8217;s less obvious. I&#8217;m a huge fan of TV On The Radio, so I thought their main stage performance [in 2006] was a knock-out. And unfortunately, the one band I wanted to see two years ago was Band Of Horses, and I didn&#8217;t get to see one song. So I&#8217;m hoping that there are three or four bands that I&#8217;ll get to see this year, and that I won&#8217;t get dragged off to, you know, check out some portaloos overflowing somewhere and actually get to watch some bands. </p>
<p>Actually I know a pretty funny experience &#8211; Brian Wilson played Splendour [in 2006] and I was smoking cigarettes at the time. I was standing side of stage. I&#8217;d had a drink. I was with my partner, we were chatting away. All of a sudden the side of stage crowd parted, and started looking at us. Brian Wilson pointed at me and said, ?You are smoking. Stop smoking. I&#8217;m going to stop playing if you don&#8217;t stop smoking.? The whole 15,000 people in the tent were looking at me. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>Paul: I thought he was joking. I thought it was part of his banter, the old man jokey rant. But after about 20 seconds we realised, no, he was waiting for her to stub it out. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Jess: And he just didn&#8217;t let it go for the whole set. I actually had to leave the side of stage. I couldn&#8217;t watch any more of the performance. I was quite traumatised by it.</p>
<p><strong>Epic line-up this year. How do you decide who plays, and who doesn&#8217;t?</strong><br/>
Paul: We fight, short answer. Like brother and sister, cats and dogs sometimes. Because we have a pot of money, right. It&#8217;s like this: put you and your best friend in a room, and you go, ?OK, we&#8217;ve got this much money to spend on the ultimate line-up?, and then you start arguing. So it goes back and forth, and through attrition we agree on things?</p>
<p>Jess: But in saying that, there&#8217;s a lot that we agree on. </p>
<p>Paul: Yeah, we do. We ultimately agree.</p>
<p><strong>Who wanted what this year?</strong><br/>
Paul: Let&#8217;s see. The Strokes have been on our list forever. So have The Pixies, but they&#8217;d just been here [in Australia], so we agreed on that. Temper Trap I erred Jess toward, a little bit. Maybe the other way around for Florence [+ The Machine]. LCD [Soundsystem], Jess was a slam dunk. I didn&#8217;t even bother. That was definitely something she was big on.</p>
<p>Jess: We really put a concerted effort in. We started booking the line-up about six months before we announced the show.</p>
<p>Paul: In October/November last year, we were making lists, and negotiating deals overseas. Before Christmas this year we&#8217;ll be overseas again, probably making two or three trips around LA, New York and London, booking talent for next year.</p>
<p>Jess: So to buy a band, you should go and sit in the agent&#8217;s office, and see what they&#8217;ve got available. Often what they&#8217;ve got available is based on whether they&#8217;ve got a new record coming out. So there&#8217;s that, but there&#8217;s also a hit-list which, for instance, The Flaming Lips, The Strokes and Pixies are probably three that have always been on the list and we don&#8217;t care if there&#8217;s a new record or not, we just want them to play.</p>
<p>Paul: There&#8217;s quite a few still on the list. But we won&#8217;t tell you who they are.</p>

<p><strong>Out of your budget, how much money do you have to fork out for your headline acts, like say The Strokes, or The Pixies?</strong><br/>
Paul: We can&#8217;t really say the specific fee, but it would be safe to say that the line-up of talent for the show is in the multi, multi millions of dollars. Just to give you some idea, it&#8217;s our biggest cost, and believe me, tents, fences, staff, they don&#8217;t come cheap &#8211; We spent a lot of money on the line-up. For us, it&#8217;s [the] core of what we do. We probably could have taken 10 bands off this bill and substituted them out with cheaper options, but it&#8217;s not in our style. We start out with a utopian line-up, and we try to make it affordable for us.</p>
<p>Jess: To give you some perspective, we set a budget to spend on bands. This year, we spent $1.5 million over that budget. And I mean, that money has to come from somewhere, so we were just really intent on creating the best line-up that we could.</p>
<p>Paul: The feedback that we&#8217;ve got on the line-up has been immense, this year. It&#8217;s pretty gratifying, too, because we were moving site, we had a history in Byron Bay &#8211; It really felt to us that the line-up was so strong that everybody was going to come with us [to Woodford]. And you did, which is great. But part of the thinking too, was that it was our 10th birthday and we were in a new location, and we wanted to make it a special year. It was worth every penny. Well, we haven&#8217;t seen it all yet, but we&#8217;re hoping it&#8217;s worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other events that you get inspiration from, or model your event on?</strong><br/>
Jess: Plagiarism&#8217;s rife.</p>
<p>Paul: I went to Burning Man [held in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada] a couple of years ago, and their arts program is off the hook. I got ideas from that. Jess travelled to Glastonbury, Coachella &#8211; even little ones, not just big ones.</p>
<p><strong>I thought the whole exchanging a used can for a dollar off a drink was a really good idea. Was it just costs that made you rethink that?</strong><br/>
Paul: What happened in the past was that we put a $1 surcharge on a drink item, so if it was $6, you paid $7 for it, but there was inherent value, then, of the dollar in a can. So if you returned the can to a recycling station, you&#8217;d get a $1 drink ticket back. So you could technically accumulate 10 or 15 cans, and go get enough money to pick up a couple of drinks. That was the system, and it did keep the site very clean.</p>
<p>Jess: This site is quite complicated for us. We were really stretching our resources just trying to accommodate such a large amount of people in the campgrounds. That [can system] is quite complicated. It has so many ramifications beyond putting a cost on the drink ticket, which is everything from staffing it to making it work for people. And also, while it&#8217;s a great initiative, a lot of people object to even the idea that their drink seems a dollar more expensive. They can&#8217;t wrap their head around the fact that it&#8217;s only paid once, and they can actually get it back in the long-term. So we went, ?Look, let&#8217;s just try to get the show right?, and then hopefully we&#8217;ll look at all of those issues and we&#8217;ll try and do it next year. We certainly haven&#8217;t let it go, we&#8217;ve just put it on ice for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Just with the mid-strength alcohol laws in Queensland, how&#8217;s that been?</strong><br/>
Jess: You know, it&#8217;s incredibly disappointing. We went to inordinate lengths to meet with licensing to try and beg and plead to get full-strength. It&#8217;s not something we&#8217;ve had to do before. The reality is that we&#8217;re in Queensland, and to a degree, we have to toe the line with what licensing want to give us. That said, we&#8217;ve had some really great wins, like at the wine bar, you can buy a bottle of wine, and we&#8217;ve been able to operate quite late hours, as well. In many ways, we&#8217;re running longer hours than we were at Belongil Fields. But yeah, it&#8217;s a pain in the arse.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve heard the [Labor] Government is going to invest some money into developing the site. I just wondered what kind of plans there are.</strong><br/>
Jess: Are you talking about the $3 million that was announced yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I heard it on the news.</strong><br/>
Jess: So if the Labor government win the next federal election, they&#8217;ve pledged to give $3 million to Woodfordia, to help upgrade their site. I can&#8217;t really speak on behalf of Woodfordia, because the money&#8217;s going to them, not to us. But from what I read in the press release, it would go towards putting in more permanent toilets, showers, upgrading roads, sewerage and power. All those kind of things that you guys don&#8217;t really notice, that make it much easier to run events.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s happening with the site you guys purchased outside of Byron? Where are things at there? Is that under the Byron Shire Council still?</strong><br/>
Paul: We have a property &#8211; 620-odd acres &#8211; at Yelgun as some people know. We bought that property after some consultation with the Byron Shire Council. As we went through the approvals process, I think the Byron Shire Council changed their opinion, potentially, about the viability of it. We went through the Land and Environment Court, and there was a zoning issue with some land that made the Council&#8217;s approval null and void. It got a little sticky at that point, going forward, and got to be a bit of a political hot potato, wouldn&#8217;t you say, in Byron Bay?</p>
<p>Jess: I guess we lost the support of council when there were a very vocal minority who were opposed to us being at that particular site. I think if you break it down, their objections are really based on that they don&#8217;t want to live next door to it. I can completely understand. Who would want to live next door to a festival site? </p>
<p>Paul: These people might, the festival-goers.</p>
<p>Jess: We have had the support of Byron Council, and they did approve our trial event, and then we lost over a technicality in court. Since then, the [NSW] state government took on the application and they realised the potential that [Splendour] and other events could bring to that particular region, and so our application for an events venue is about to be lodged with state government in the next week. We&#8217;ve spent years putting it together, and a lot of time working on everything from the ecology to traffic and noise. [It] will then sit with the Department of Planning for probably six months, and we&#8217;ll get a response then as to whether they&#8217;ll let us operate back in Byron.</p>
<blockquote><p>?We start out with a utopian line-up, and we try to make it affordable for us.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Aside from Goldfrapp, and more recently The Pixies, it seems that Brisbane tends to miss out on Brisbane sideshows. Why is that, and do you see that changing in the future?</strong><br/>
Paul: Generally most of the Splendour audience comes from Brisbane, so to keep the exclusivity of our event, we will often not announce sideshows. One of things that we&#8217;ve found in the past, also, is that due to Brisbane being a smaller city than some of the others, the ticket trends for bands who did do sideshows were pretty bad. Brisbane could be, for certain acts, quite risky. So it was a combination of making sure that, for the Brisbane market, Splendour was seen as an exclusive opportunity to see those bands, and also a way of taking out a certain element of risk. Will it change in the future? I don&#8217;t see it changing radically. A couple of bands did it because they were under exceptional circumstances, so we permitted it. Our policy to this date, is to not [allow Brisbane sideshows].</p>
<p>Like many countries. I know a lot of acts who go and play Glastonbury, or V Fest in the UK, those are their only UK shows, full stop. They don&#8217;t play any other cities at all. I know it frustrates music fans in Brisbane, but it&#8217;s a slippery slope if we start doing shows in Brisbane, then you&#8217;ll probably start off a chain reaction of people who, when Splendour goes on sale, waiting to see which sideshows are announced before they buy a ticket, and then Splendour might not sell out. It&#8217;s a chain reaction that we&#8217;re probably not too game to experiment with at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Have you considered a contractual clause wherein, if Splendour does sell out, then you can announce sideshows?</strong><br/>
Paul: Yes, but then people learn to expect that.</p>
<p>Jess: We have done some Brisbane sideshows, but they just don&#8217;t work. The reality is that we&#8217;ve lost money on every single show we&#8217;ve done in Brisbane, because the majority of people come to Splendour. I think if there was a huge demand, and shows were selling out, we would probably run with it. The reality is that there&#8217;s just not [a demand].</p>
<p>Paul: The Pixies playing at The Zoo, that would sell out in a heartbeat. They wanted that as a warm-up date, to physically grace the stage before they hit the big stage. I don&#8217;t even know if Goldfrapp has sold out. They&#8217;re playing The Tivoli. If it hasn&#8217;t, that would be an indicator as to what we&#8217;re trying to explain.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the timetable, at a clash like Foals and Yeasayer at the same time, is there a reason you do that so early in the day?</strong><br/>
Paul: You know, can I just say that if that bothers you, we&#8217;d switch it out, but then it&#8217;d bother someone else. We can&#8217;t make everybody happy with scheduling. It&#8217;s just a fact. We needed LCD Soundsystem to be in the Mix Up Tent at the same time as whoever in the main Amphitheatre, so that we don&#8217;t have 35,000 people trying to get into the Amphitheatre at the one time. It&#8217;s a safety responsibility. </p>
<p>Jess: It&#8217;s just a reality of a festival. You&#8217;re going to have overlaps, unfortunately. We really try and keep each act in mind when we&#8217;re placing them, and also, some can only play on a certain days because they&#8217;re got international obligations. So suddenly you&#8217;ve got acts of the same size that you need to put on.</p>
<p>Paul: We have bands that fly out tomorrow [Saturday] to go and play Fuji Rock in Japan on Sunday, so those bands all have to be on the Friday. As Jess said, if they&#8217;re of a similar size and they need to be off-site tonight a certain time, we don&#8217;t really have much choice.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your reasons for not making this a touring festival?</strong><br/>
Jess: Because it takes us a year to organise this show. Turning it into a touring festival would mean that we&#8217;d have to stretch our resources to different cities. I&#8217;d rather make this the biggest, the best, the most fabulous experience, [rather] than water it down to make five or six [events] around the place. Also, I&#8217;ve been doing events for a long time, and Paul as well, and I just don&#8217;t have the energy to do that many shows. It&#8217;s fucking exhausting.</p>
<p>Paul: Can I just add: this is untourable. It&#8217;s just not tourable. Jess has been on-site for three weeks, I&#8217;ve been here for two weeks. There&#8217;s people doing works out here, prepping, weeks and weeks in advance. I mean, it&#8217;s a mini-city. We have a police station, we have a fire brigade base here, we have a couple of ambulances. We have 38 electricians, 22 plumbers. It&#8217;s a city. It&#8217;s a little town. You just can&#8217;t tour little towns.</p>
<p><strong>To finish up, what inspired you to introduce the forum element to Splendour this year?</strong><br/>
Jess: I just wanted for all the fun things out there, for there to be some kind of serious platform at the show, and an opportunity &#8211; to be able to answer the questions that must drive you nuts, like the question about timetable clashes, which must shit you up the wall. To have the opportunity to answer those kind of questions is great. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to have a bit more of a dialogue, rather than people just coming here, having a drink and seeing some bands, if we can extend that experience for them, to talk about it; that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here, and why [the forum] is of interest to us. And if there&#8217;s 100 or 200 people sitting here, listening to what we&#8217;ve got to say, that&#8217;s a success to us. That&#8217;s worth persisting with.</p>
