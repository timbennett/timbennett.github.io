                <h3>With the ARIA Awards set to take place at Sydney&#8217;s ACER Arena tonight, past winner <strong>DAVE GRANEY</strong> has some advice for the current crop of hopefuls: if you&#8217;re seated close to the aisle and to the front, you&#8217;ve won.

The ARIAs are a lousy TV program. That&#8217;s the basic thing. Anything in regards to music, or awards shows for that matter, TV people obsess over making it ?live?, which always makes it long and tedious and not very exciting. One day someone will have the idea to pool the talents of TV directors and editors, tighten it up and throw it on the screens a few hours later full of bounce and fast moves. No one would get hurt, the talent wouldn&#8217;t get so bossed about by all the fussy ?industry? wranglers and seat warmers and the people watching it might get a thrill.</p>
<p>When I first head about the ARIAs it had already been going a few years, and it seemed &#8211; depending on who you heard talking about it &#8211; to have been more fun in the old days when it wasn&#8217;t televised. Stories of giant piss-ups, ?roast?-like behaviour and debauched parties were the  general flow of the legend. Sounded great. Like Vegas before the parking lots filled up with caravans and trailers.</p>
<p>It all seemed like a closed shop though, much like the music business in general. Funny, it seems like that way even more so now. I made three albums for Universal Records and went to the ARIAs a few times. I never paid and don&#8217;t think I ever would. One of the first times, I presented an award with Diesel. He seemed to be a regular. I was wearing a tailor-made jumpsuit and he made a fuss over it. I said, ?You&#8217;ll all be wearing this next year.? How wrong I was (and would always) be. </p>
<p>I had to give an award. I ignored the script that was thrown up on a  screen at the back and said hello to all the musicians in the room and at home. I asked them to bear in mind that we were the ones that music was all about. Everybody else was just hangin? on, or something to that effect. People talked about my clothes.</p>
<blockquote><p>?In all the dates leading up to the ARIAs that year, for about six months, I had walked around between songs like a magician with one more trick, holding my index finger in the air.?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are always incongruous international guests at the ARIAs. That year it was Meatloaf and he surprisingly made a point of seeking me out and saying he enjoyed my words. He spoke very quietly and walked off. Class! I also enjoyed seeing Slim Dusty perform a song and David Gates from Bread who was launching a greatest hits album. (His voice was beautiful). Janet Jackson also appeared. She gave the impression she was both from another planet and visiting another planet. Mandawuy Yunupingu from Yothu Yindi came out with the singer of The Badloves and gave a shout-out to all his friends who couldn&#8217;t be there. ?Who&#8217;s that?? he was asked. ?The kookaburras and the kangaroos and&#8230;,? he began, and then the windup music started.</p>
<p>In 1996, Savage Garden were presented to the business as the &#8220;Next Big Thing&#8221; and that all duly came true over the next 12 months. The year prior silverchair performed Radio Birdman&#8217;s ?New Race? with Tim Rogers and smashed their guitars and a bit of the scenery. Record company executives stood and applauded. It was beyond naff!</p>

<p>The night is torture for any artist invited. They are shucked of all their cool no matter what happens. It&#8217;s always fun to meet a lot of other players but everybody is pulled into the game. If any nominee is reading this, if you are seated close to the aisle and to the front, you are a winner. Ease of access for the cameras.</p>

In 1996 I was sitting just there with Clare Moore and my friends Tex Perkins and Christina. We were all kind of comrades, having been bums on the outer and finding ourselves in more happening situations. Five years earlier, we were not really in the equation, well Clare Moore and I weren&#8217;t. I had been to the UK to meet a label and had gone shopping for gear (as you do). I was watching these old TV programs about a character called Jason King and I wanted to look like him. Jason was a dandy spy, an older cat in a  bouffant wig and great threads. </p>
<p>Our album <em>The Soft&#8217;n&#8217;Sexy Sound</em> was full of songs about performers being in disguise and hiding out in public situations. And so that&#8217;s how I found myself at the ARIAs wearing a pink velvet suit I&#8217;d bought in a shop called &#8220;Rocker&#8221; and a brand new pair of platform shoes, a wig and some shades. When I looked in the mirror, I looked great! </p>
<p>In all the dates leading up to the ARIAs that year, for about six months, I had walked around between songs like a magician with one more trick, holding my index finger in the air. Previously, I had been noted for talking a lot at gigs but as our audiences grew, I started to make some big gestures and use some silence. Some tension. I liked to always walk around at gigs with my finger in the air, as if to promise, ?One more trick to come!?</p>
<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wI1f3Dp22qI&amp;hl=en&lt;em&gt;US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&#8243;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=" allowfullscreen=""/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/wI1f3Dp22qI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"/></object></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to win as I was seated next to Tex, and he was much more popular. But suddenly the boom camera swung around to us and my name was read out. I stood up with my finger in the air and walked to the podium. Chrissie Amphlett and Shirley Manson from Garbage thought I was a prankster from the crowd. There was no air kissing. They shrank away from me. I said, under my breath as if to myself, ?King Of Pop.&#8221; I thought it was a better title than ?Best Male Artist?. LESS pompous. I thanked everybody, especially Clare Moore and my comrades in The Coral Snakes: Rod Hayward, Gordy Blair and Robin Casinader who had fought so many heroic battles with me.</p>
<p>That night I met many people I never saw again. Deborah Hutton said my outfit was bad. I cared less. Ian Turpie told me to ?smile and wave?. We partied in the ?Ricky May Bar? at the Sebel Townhouse and stayed in the ?John Farnham Room?. The next day the head of the ARIAs was bitching in the newspapers about dropping the Best Male Artist award because a person like me &#8211; an antihero &#8211; had won it. Soon, they also pulled down the Sebel Townhouse! That was a bit of an overreaction.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t care. We&#8217;d recorded a very arty album called <em>The Devil Drives</em> and left immediately to mix it with some London studio cats who never heard of an ARIA, let alone Dave Graney. On the downside, our record company suddenly knew who we were. Things had been going so well in the tiny part of the corporation our champion A&amp;R man had created for us. Then he left. </p>
<p>Isaac Hayes spoke at an awards night shortly before he died and tried to tell all the performers to take care as they were the most expendable and ephemeral of all. It&#8217;s true. I love it when artists misbehave at these events. Look at ODB at the Grammys, Jarvis Cocker trying to embarrass Michael Jackson and Kanye West recently. Did you hear about the time country singer Charlie Rich was at the Country Awards? He had taken a few slugs of whiskey and when he opened the envelope saying John Denver was the best country singer of that year he pulled out his Zippo lighter and?</p>

<p>Dave Graney&#8217;s current solo album <em>Knock Yourself Out</em> isn&#8217;t nominated for any awards at tonight&#8217;s ARIAs.</p>
