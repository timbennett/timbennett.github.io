                <h3>Adelaide native <strong>MATT BANHAM</strong> pays tribute to The Jade Monkey, which will soon make way for a $65-million development.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3027805/440x587-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
My old band No Through Road played our first and last gigs at the Jade Monkey several years apart. After our first gig I had to go to the hospital with mild concussion after falling head first off a drum kit. After the last gig we all had to go home to nurse our old man hangovers.</p>
<p>Over the past nine or so years I have wandered along to countless shows at the Jade Monkey; some good, some bad. At least at the bad ones there was a nice beer garden you could escape to. I remember loudly daring my friend Ben Flippy to jump over the back fence of the beer garden one night, promising I would go with him. I didn&#8217;t, but he did, and was stuck in an alleyway that he couldn&#8217;t come back from. No one bothered to help him out. Great times. A lot of nights there have blurred into one, probably because Zac never refused me service. (It makes him one of the best bartenders in town.)</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3027806/400x310-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
I started playing music in Adelaide properly around 1999; only seeing glimpses of its heyday when venues like The Tivoli, Producers and Mad Love Bar gave bands a lot of choice of places to play around the city. One by one they were all disappearing. The only choices left seemed to be The Rhino Room, The Crown &amp; Sceptre and The Grace Emily and my friends and I would play these three venues as often as we could. Around 2001, The Crown &amp; Sceptre was sold and became some sort of ?funky bar? and the Rhino Room began to focus on comedy and DJs. My friends and I were at a bit of a loss of what to do. Dark days for Adelaide.</p>
<p>Along came the Jade Monkey. Created by Zac Coligan and Naomi Thompson in late 2002, it was a godsend. It was a place for musicians made by musicians. It was like our own little FUBU venue. I had seen Zac around town since I was about 17 playing in a band called Bergerac. I thought they were pretty cool, and they all had really great sneakers. Zac was the super-friendly bass player who would remember your name and was crazy enthusiastic about everything; perfect personality to run a bar really. Naomi and Zac went onto play in the wonderful Sea Thieves and though a lot quieter a bartender than Zac, she always knew what I wanted to drink before I got to the bar. Just like in <em>Cheers</em>. I was Norm, she was Shelly Long, and Zac was Danson with pointier sideburns. </p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3027807/400x310-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Pretty soon my pals and I were there all the time, either playing or watching or talking crap while pretending to be watching. Oh, how I scoffed at the people walking around with pots of tea as I drank lager after lager, and tried to convince Zac to let me behind the bar to ?help people out?. And the bands were pretty good too. I remember seeing great sets from Love Of Diagrams, Wolf &amp; Cub, Wagons, Hit The Jackpot, Grand Salvo, Sweet Raxxx and many more. Colin (Adelaide&#8217;s biggest music fan) became their unofficial glassy and used to wander round the bar, carrying bottles and talking-up bands to anyone who would listen. The place was a loud, stinky, smoke-free bed of local musicians and their friends, only ever interrupted by the cocktail blender that always seemed to pipe up during bands? acoustic numbers. </p>

<p/>
<p>Bands loved the huge stage covered in twinkling lights &#8211; even if there was a spot that dripped rain on you occasionally. Mixers loved the mixing pulpit where they could loom over people. I DJed there a couple of times and felt like a Golden God watching over my drunken minions. For years they even hung the ugly sign that my friend Cuchulain made for them; accommodating is a good word for Zac and Naomi.</p>
<blockquote><p>?The place was a loud, stinky, smoke-free bed of local musicians and their friends.?</p></blockquote>
<p>At the moment the Jade looks like it might be <a href="/news/4432329">closing down</a> or <a href="/news/4433341">moving to another location</a> which is an enormous pity. I&#8217;m certain many young Adelaide bands played some of their first gigs in that room. Some great, some awful but at least there was a place that bands had a chance to play that wasn&#8217;t just the back room of a bar &#8211; it&#8217;s a proper venue with foldback and everything! Like a real show that your parents could be proud of and say , I&#8217;m going to my daughter&#8217;s concert.? Just like those famous-type people.</p>
<p>The famous old Jade should live forever, if not on Twin Street let&#8217;s hope for an equally good location. And when they are old and deaf, I can visit Naomi and Zac and hassle them to let me behind the bar or at least for a free bag of Twisties.</p>
