                <h3>Last year, he endured <a href="/articles/3833070">hooligans and sleep deprivation</a> on his maiden solo European tour, but that didn&#8217;t deter Bluebottle Kiss? <strong>JAMIE HUTCHINGS</strong> from a return visit in August/September with his brother Scott on drums.
</h3>
<h2>?Legging It Around Paris?</h2>
<p>British Airways this time. There&#8217;s some very thinly veiled misanthropy going on beneath those taut facemasks. Scott&#8217;s hard-line gregariousness manages to stun most of the stewards into action though. It&#8217;s an enviable skill he possesses. I watch <em>Shutter Island&#8217;</em>, which stops and starts constantly. When added to the plot it does whip me around a bit. By the time we get to Singapore for the stopover I&#8217;m a little loopy. I stand at the urinal and can hear one of my new songs being played through the tiny system. After clawing through my bag I realise my iPod is playing itself sans headphones. I&#8217;m not famous in Singapore after all.</p>
<p>We go straight into legging it around Paris all day long spending<br/>
around two years in the Louvre. By the look on the Mona Lisa&#8217;s face as<br/>
she endures flash after flash it&#8217;s hard to know whether she thought Da<br/>
Vinci was a bit of all right or beneath contempt. An enigma.</p>
<p>The next day we train it up to Binic in Brittany. Ludo our host and<br/>
promoter for this run picks us up. Ludo runs on more cylinders than<br/>
most humans dream of. He&#8217;s half man/half machine. Often when we are chowing down and ask him if he wants to eat something he&#8217;ll mumble, ?You must keep the lion hungry.? Intense. The first show is in a little town called Plouha. Like most of our French shows it&#8217;s on an outdoor stage and I feel pretty naked after only playing a few smaller club shows with Scott at home before we left. It&#8217;s one thing creating something with the two of us in an intimate environment but with just the two of us in broad daylight in a public square it&#8217;s something else and my nerves mess things up a bit. Scott does his famous disappearing act just before we start. He does like to toy with me. The show is in front of a huge church in the main centre of this quaint town, surrounded by stalls and people of all ages. We do our best and sell a few CDs. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re followed by Texans, <strong>The Black Diamond Heavies</strong>, a duo of Fender Rhodes/vocals and drums. A blindfold listen to these guys would convince you that the singer John should look like Fats Domino instead of a skinny white bloke, he sounds like he gargles glass. Very good garage/soul kind of combo. Our host for the evening is an eccentric six foot plus she-male with a solid handshake named ?Poppette? who has cooked us some very watery spaghetti and bemoans her lack of marital prospects. As usual the night winds on till all the bands beg for bedtime.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Binic Folk Blues Festival</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014447/300x500-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
After some swimming in the brisk ocean we head to soundcheck for the<br/>
first day of the Binic Folk Blues Festival. During soundcheck an<br/>
elderly man implores me in French for something or other while his<br/>
wife who is confined to a wheelchair stares at me stony-eyed and<br/>
poker-faced. Ludo mentions the gent is somewhat of a freak and is<br/>
infamous in the town for engaging in a number of unsavoury activities. Eventually we deduct that he&#8217;d like his wife to be given the opportunity to sing. We hand her the mic and she performs a couple of<br/>
a capella styled versions of old French standards, her monotonic inflections reverberating across the harbour. </p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3014448/300x400-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Later I watch a French two-piece garage band called <strong>The Magnetics</strong> thrash away. I see a girl all of five-years-old in a complete solo rock&#8217;n?roll reverie. Eyes closed, weaving all over the place, I get a little lump in my throat seeing such a gorgeous primitive reaction to what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s something we really notice about this event, and others like it: that there&#8217;s tiny tots to grandparents all up late and getting in on the action. All the acts here are very much of the blues/garage scene or more traditional old time bluegrass or rockabilly in style, quite a lot of one-man band types too. One girl from Arizona called Becky Lee shows a bit of one-upmanship by managing to hold a drumstick in her guitar picking hand while going at the rest of the kit and the neck.</p>
<p>Thus we are a little sore thumbish and I&#8217;m still feeling somewhat self aware during our set which is complicated by an amplifier that sounds like it&#8217;s had its valves dipped repeatedly in Colonel Sanders? secret sauce. People are tuned in though and queue up to buy CDs, have them signed and ask lots of questions. It&#8217;s good. I am repeatedly asked, ?Are you famous in Australia?? Yes. Yes I am. Scott and I eat upstairs at Ludo&#8217;s bar afterwards surveying the scene. The streets teem with people while boats ebb in the distance over the noise. A bung amplifier is of little consequence now.</p>
<p>The next day we play a bigger stage, despite being a little different to much of what&#8217;s happening I&#8217;m feeling more in tune and Scott has no such problems. He&#8217;s started speaking in bad French and they are taking to his Mafioso stage persona. Slicked-back hair, aviators, leather jacket &#8211; he is out-rocking me big time.</p>
<p>We get a great response and sell plenty of CDs, some of them to old ladies. The next night is a hole in the wall show in the beer garden of a restaurant a little further up the coast. I go for a walk and get some kind of bearing as to where this part of the world is. We get spoilt at the restaurant again, which probably explains the diners being a little more absorbed in their plates than us. It&#8217;s good though, Scott and I are starting to play seamlessly, it&#8217;s like a mechanical horse you can just ride at will now. </p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3014444/640x420-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>On the Monday, Scott and I do a little more swimming and then head down the coast a little to do another outdoor show with the Black Diamond Heavies and <strong>Shake it Like a Caveman</strong>. We head to the end of the pier and watch all the teenage Frenchies impressing each other with their aerial hijinks into the water and nonchalant ciggie loving. The tobacco kings  are hauling it in this part of the world.</p>
<p>The set-up for this gig is pretty laid back being Monday and we take a few bends and twists in our set. The Black Diamond Heavies do a great rendition of &#8216;Sinner Man&#8217; by Nina Simone and we all head upstairs for a communal dinner which involves sea snails, choice vino and group photos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little worse for wear the next day and spend the morning battling with a computer. Those who know me will know how fierce this can be.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3014443/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Ludo and his brother Higgins again spoil Scott and I at a restaurant with our protests falling on deaf ears. We head into the medieval town of Dinan to play our last French show. This time a gent called Stefan who camped in Ludo&#8217;s backyard during the festival insists on buying everyone dinner. It&#8217;s a hospitality overdose. The town is full of tiny glued-together terraces with  sinister little attics with wooden shutters. We play in a tiny bar in the corner. It&#8217;s pretty  much the only place open being a Tuesday night and the crowd is subdued but healthy. An Englishman gives us lots of unwanted free advice regarding my lack of banter and the price of CDs. It reminds me of the Brit in <em>Anvil! The Story of Anvil</em> when they&#8217;re playing some dive in Eastern Europe for nix. His lovely Kiwi mate is not dissuaded and buys a CD.</p>
<p>Catch the train to Paris and then a train to whoop whoop to fly with ?Povo Air? or Ryan Air as they are more commonly known. They have inspired me to build an airport in Dungog. We are herded like cattle to board and the whole plane turns into some kind of backpacker party. Ugly.</p>
<p/>
<h2>?Welcome To Italy?</h2>
<p>Amanda, my northern hemisphere manager/booker/girl genius, has booked us into a B&amp;B near the airport. Antonella, the host, is late as someone  else decided they were me when they saw her holding the sign and tried to get into her car. Scott asks if there&#8217;s anywhere open where we can eat something (it&#8217;s midnight) she says she&#8217;ll whip up some pasta which she does as well as gelato and some beers. Championess! There&#8217;s no sign of it on the bill the next day. Welcome to Italy.</p>
<p>We pick up the hire car the next day and get acquainted with ?Frieda?, our GPS. Frieda proves to be mercurial in temperament, Takes us off the highway only to put us back on it, loves her roundabouts. When she gets cross she speaks in a clipped icy German accent. I use whatever persuasive powers I possess to placate her mysterious wiles. It takes patience, kindness and a listening ear. We eventually hit it off but not until we&#8217;ve hung out at a few random cul-de-sacs and disused car parks. </p>
<p>Anyway we get to this hotel in a small town in Alessandra called Tassarolo. It&#8217;s closed as its siesta time, some old chaps? gesture for us to take a seat and shoot the breeze with them. Through sign language and such they tell us there is a huge castle in town that people like to jump off and that the hotel we are staying at is very hot. Both pieces of information prove to be correct. We are booked to play an outside square near the beach in Savona. It&#8217;ll be a tough gig but it pays OK until they call us halfway there to let us know it&#8217;s raining and cancelled and that we&#8217;ll be compensated with half the cash. Looks pretty sunny when we arrive but they won&#8217;t be persuaded. We swim, take the money and head back to the country. We are greeted by the humiliating sounds of a local covers band blasting through the square. An inauspicious start.</p>

On the way into town the next morning we spy the castle discussed brokenly with our elderly Italian friends. It&#8217;s an ominous scene. One half is well preserved and barred. The roof is covered with pigeons while the other half has been totally torn apart by nature. Vines and trees grow through dilapidated roofs, a distant bell tower peers above a collapsed turret. A huge rusty iron door and barbed wire fence bars entry, however we spy a path that is only made inaccessible by thick weed and bramble. Scott being quite the guerrilla photographer insists we break in. Once we get through the path we&#8217;re met with an astonishing site. A whole series of ruined castles, part of the main castle is a church. All the murals have faded; the floor is strewn with rubble with stairs that lead to nowhere or collapsed rooms. Ideal for a death metal photo shoot. A pitch black cellar full of enormous busted wine barrels, while outside the air is full of fresh mint and butterflies. I keep waiting for some gun-toting caretaker to scare us off but none arrives.</p>

<p>That night we head to the venue in Franca Villa. With a bit of help we discover the venue is named after the year the castle was completed (1340). It was last occupied by the Germans when they took control over it and used it as a detention centre in World War II. No one has used it since. Spooky. </p>
<p>The gig is OK; the hospitality, however, is outstanding. So outstanding that Scott has quiet a heavy reaction to their generosity particularly in regards to the copious amounts of cured meat offered. We really do overdose on meat and cheese in Italy. A vegan holiday maker would have to be airlifted on a stretcher out of this place. Scott learns how to say, ?I don&#8217;t speak Italian? with Pavarotti-inspired gusto and uses it to dramatic effect during the rest of the trip. They like him a lot.</p>
<p>Due to the state of Scott&#8217;s intestines we move pretty slow the next day finally hitting the road in the early afternoon. It&#8217;s bucketing rain all the way and when we get to the venue no one is about so we have a look around Torino, the nearby city. It&#8217;s a pretty squalid claustrophobic place, crammed with huge old apartment blocks. The venue seems to be in the middle of nowhere. We meet the owner; an old rocker ironically named Elvis. He informs us that he&#8217;s had no luck with sourcing a drum kit for us. However, he can access a Cajun drum or perhaps a djembe. Scott is nonplussed. He takes us back to the hotel which has a lobby Vince Sorrenti would kill for. </p>
<p>Eventually, Elvis finds an old pal, who is kind of a hippy version of himself who has ?some bits and pieces?. Shortly before we play, his friend arrives resplendent in a paisley waistcoat etc. with a weird bongo type drum ingeniously attached to a kick-drum pedal. A toy snare drum, matching hi-hats and a cymbal with a stand. Slap bass and bongo circuit we&#8217;re a comin?! Seriously though, it&#8217;s better than a djembe so we&#8217;re kind of indebted to this guy in a backwards kind of way, and Elvis and co. keep us well watered. </p>
<p>The ghost of Frieda seems to inhabit the PA most of the night with monitors turning off and on at will, but we manage to churn through our marathon set with a couple of fans converted by the end. When we get off stage, Elvis? wife is pretty keen on having a sing and asks me if I know any Jefferson Airplane or Carole King. I tell her I&#8217;m a Carole fan, but don&#8217;t know how to play any of her songs. I hand my guitar to her friend, Scott remains onstage on his sci-fi kit and our percussion lender adds some very zealous bongo fury. They murder ?Blue Suede Shoes? and something else. I do front-of-house sound. Sweet as. I ask Elvis if I have to fill out all the myriads of papers that you seem to be required to fill out to get paid here. He replies, ?No?, then pauses searching for the words to explain in English: ?We &#8211; we &#8211; we bandit.?</p>
