                <h3>Documenting the live experience has never been easier &#8211; so how can Moshcam compete with those annoying iPhone wavers? We talk to founder Paul Hannigan about the challenges of capturing the fleeting magic of a live show.
</h3>

?Nothing beats actually being at a gig,? admits Paul Hannigan, who co-founded Moshcam five years ago with two friends as a way of capturing the magic of live performance for those who couldn&#8217;t be there, or those wanting to relive the experience. Since then, the online start-up has built up a huge catalogue of international and local acts &#8211; from chart-topper Gotye (incidentally, Moshcam&#8217;s first ever shoot) to The Drones, Eddy Current Suppression Ring, Royal Headache, Tame Impala, even Melbourne&#8217;s infamous Teenage Mothers.</p>
<p>Now with the proliferation of smart phones putting gig coverage into the hands of the average punter, has the function of Moshcam changed? We talk to Hannigan about how the site has evolved since its modest beginnings in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the origins of Moshcam.</strong><br/>
We started Moshcam five years ago when myself and John Reddin, who was working in TV production, met with Elia Eliades, the owner/operator of Century Venues who run The Enmore Theatre, Metro Theatre and Factory Theatre. As a music fan going to so many great shows, and as someone with an internet background, I was searching for a compelling way to bring those two things together. When the three of us got talking, it was obvious what we needed to do.</p>
<p><strong>What was the first gig?</strong><br/>
The very first gig was none other than Gotye. How prescient was that? We knew he was something special, but the big question at the time was ?could he do it live?? He put together a live mini-orchestra and proved he could. Now five years later he&#8217;s [number one] all over the world. And you can still watch that show on Moshcam, which proves the power of building a catalogue of great on-demand video. We want these shows to stand as a testament to this incredibly exciting period of live music growth and always be available for music fans to enjoy.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Any other shows that stick out?</strong><br/>
Personal favourites include Gaslight Anthem, Art Vs Science, Fatoumata Diawara, Gary Numan and Explosions In The Sky but we cast a pretty wide net across genres, so there&#8217;s pretty much something for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>How has the service evolved over the past five years?</strong><br/>
The main difference has been down to progress in technology. Growth in broadband has allowed us to continually improve the quality of our streaming video, and advances in the mobile sector has allowed us to develop an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/moshcam/id495014972?mt=8">app</a> that means you can watch full shows on your iPad and iPhone, and we&#8217;re working on an Android version as we speak. The other area that is changing the landscape is IPTV and today you can watch our full-length shows on a number of services, including Sony Bravia TV and Blu-Ray, GoogleTV and Hulu. Other platforms such as PS3 are coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits to the audience are obvious, but is this something bands desire too?</strong><br/>
Absolutely. We&#8217;ve reached that point where most savvy labels and managers understand the importance of giving fans a connection with the artists they love. And while social media obviously owns this space, it doesn&#8217;t mean much without compelling content to back it up, which is where we come in. If you look at someone like Amanda Palmer, someone who is incredibly plugged in to her fan network, we worked with her to livecast the Dresden Dolls Enmore Theatre show and it trended number one globally on Twitter, despite it being 2am in Los Angeles and 5am in New York. What&#8217;s more, in the month following, another 150,000 fans watched the gig on demand.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Are bands more self-conscious when they know they&#8217;re being filmed?</strong><br/>
Not that I&#8217;ve particularly noticed. Some will mug it up a little (Perry Farrell I&#8217;m looking at you) which is great to be honest. We&#8217;ve only ever had one issue around sensitivity with appearance. Not naming names, but when you film from below the lip of a high stage, double chins can turn into triple chins and one band in particular weren&#8217;t happy. And we do get the odd strange request. One (big name) band manager instructed our director: ?When you film the drummer, I want him to look like I want to f**k him in the mouth!? Not sure if we managed it but the footage was approved.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Do people care about production values these days, or is it more about documenting the experience?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a good question. As mobile phone cameras come with increasingly better cameras, fans are definitely capturing some really nice footage. However, it&#8217;s still usually a snippet or a track here and there, and the key issue is always audio quality. Also, when we started Moshcam our point of difference wasn&#8217;t just the quality of video, but the fact that we captured the entire show, which of course you can&#8217;t do without working very closely with the band. These days we&#8217;re putting more and more resources into audio fidelity as our shows are being watched on high-end home theatre systems, not just desktop or mobile. So, while I think it&#8217;s really cool that fans can document their own experience at a gig, whenever we are filming it&#8217;s great to know I can just kick back and live in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you&#8217;re trying to convey when shooting a gig? What does a typical Moshcam shoot involve?</strong><br/>
The number one thing we are trying to convey is the energy on stage and in the room. We&#8217;re not about over-production which can lead to a very sanitised version of a show. This is the main reason we usually cut live. Typically we&#8217;ll use four cameras, a director and audio engineer. If we&#8217;re shooting a larger venue like the Entertainment Centre [in Sydney] we might use a crane for increased coverage, but usually it&#8217;s all on ground so it feels like it&#8217;s being shot from the vantage point of being in the crowd, or at least a part of it, whatever your vantage point.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>We notice you have some fan footage embedded on the website. Do you see this as complementary to what you do?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s not something we&#8217;ve focused on to date as we&#8217;ve been building our catalogue, but now and again bands have released massive files that fans can download but if they don&#8217;t have the bandwidth capacity they have no way of viewing it. That&#8217;s why we stream certain footage that we think complements our service and our users would enjoy. We&#8217;d definitely like to do more crowd sourced gigs and even facilitate those somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Surely it must get annoying having to compete with all those iPhones?</strong><br/>
Ha! They&#8217;re just the new lighters, right? Our crew t-shirts are actually emblazoned on the back with, ?Put the phone down, we&#8217;ve got it covered?, but I understand completely why people want their own personal record of a moment at a show. It&#8217;s also much easier to share a small bit of video on Facebook with your friends immediately when you take it on your phone. One of the challenges of filming in an official capacity is that the band get to approve the release of the footage with inevitably means we can&#8217;t put it online immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>?When you film the drummer, I want him to look like I want to f**k him in the mouth!?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is grainy iPhone footage the new bootleg?</strong><br/>
I think there&#8217;s some truth in that from an experiential perspective. However, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to document entire shows on iPhones and I&#8217;d suggest not many people would want to sit through that anyway. Good camerawork is like good design, you don&#8217;t notice it until it&#8217;s bad. We&#8217;re not perfect by any means, but it&#8217;s a trade-off between cost, access and opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>The live webcast of Coachella seemed to be a game-changer. Is the live streaming of festivals an area you&#8217;d like to explore in the future?</strong><br/>
Absolutely. Watch this space! One of the things that excites us about doing more and more live webcasts is the immediacy and that we don&#8217;t have to wait for artist approval. They can have that after the show sure, and we&#8217;ll put it back up on demand when they are happy, but the live stream is all about the moment and creating a communal, and of course, truly global event.</p>

<p><strong>Did you think this medium can ever really replace the experience of a live gig?</strong><br/>
Not a chance. As someone who has spent more hours in live venues than probably my own house, nothing will replace the feeling of being in the room watching musicians who have quite literally changed my life playing in the flesh. Everything from the mood of the crowd to the mix in the room is something you can never replicate. That being said, if you can&#8217;t be there, or if you want to relive it, this is a damn good second best. I&#8217;ll settle for that.</p>
<p><strong>Where next for Moshcam?</strong><br/>
God, where to begin. Here&#8217;s a shortlist: 1) More international shoots &#8211; we have some amazing shows being filmed out of London, New York and Los Angeles right now but we&#8217;d also really love to work with acts in markets like India, China and South America. 2) More platforms &#8211; we want every music fan to be able to watch our shows on every device or service they use. 3) More features and functionality on the website and in our app, from event listing, fan photos, interviews, unique sessions and our own curated events. If it&#8217;s happening at or around the show, we want to capture it and share it with you.</p>
