                <h3>In the first week of October, Australia&#8217;s artistic community will descend on Newcastle for Sound Summit, a week-long talkfest and series of performances with a difference. Festival co-organiser Andrew Tuttle (aka Brisbane experimental artist Anonymeye) gives us his picks for the event, which is celebrating its 10th birthday this year.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006548/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>How and why did you get involved in Sound Summit?</strong><br/>
I applied for the role of co-director through the <a href="/news/3550736">open call</a> advertised by Sound Summit earlier this year. I decided I wanted to get involved in Sound Summit as I&#8217;ve always been impressed by the festival in the past, and also thought that as a person living outside Newcastle or Sydney, I could provide a different perspective on independent music within Australia.  </p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve attended Sound Summit in the past as a punter. What were your impressions?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve always had a great time at past Sound Summits I&#8217;ve been to. This year will be my fifth time at This Is Not Art, and the Sound Summit panels, gigs and workshops have always motivated and pushed me. They have made me challenge existing methodologies and beliefs I&#8217;ve had as a curator and musician.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Summit has traditionally been an electronic and hip-hop event. Why did you decide to broaden the scope this year?</strong><br/>
With any festival that has been ongoing for some time, there is the necessity to regenerate ideas and focus for the event to avoid stagnation. While by no stretch have we abandoned electronic and hip-hop genres in this year&#8217;s program, we wanted to augment these styles by including innovative artists from other genres, including psych-rock, free-folk and chipmusic. The broadening of Sound Summit&#8217;s scope this year also reflects my and co-director Eliza Sarlos? personal aesthetic preferences to some extent as well.</p>
<p><strong>What else is different about the festival this year?</strong><br/>
Aside from the broadened genre focus, this year&#8217;s Sound Summit also features increased collaboration with other This Is Not Art satellite festivals, reflecting the increasing diversity and multi-tasking capabilities required for artists and arts workers to survive doing what they love. This year&#8217;s Sound Summit also features several Newcastle musicians in a performance and speaking role, which in past years has perhaps not been as prominent as would theoretically be expected. We&#8217;ve also included several new events, including the Sound Summit debut of CDR Sessions, an event deconstructing the mysteries of music making and providing a platform for punters to play new, unreleased and work-in-progress tracks on a big sound system.  </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s your 10th birthday, will there be cake?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m hoping for both cake and novelty cards, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.  </p>
<p><strong>Aside from the fact that silverchair hail from there, what makes Newcastle such a suitable venue?</strong><br/>
A. Newcastle has a vibrant community of artists and other community types, who have been supported by various artist-run initiatives and similar bodies over the years. The Renew Newcastle project is one that interests Sound Summit, as it takes an interesting approach to artistic sustainability and re-appropriation of space. Having a festival in a convenient-to-reach ?destination? city is also a plus, as it allows participants and punters to be consumed by what&#8217;s happening in the festival while on holiday, rather than being distracted by the realities of every day life. </p>
<p>B. The Dissociatives.  </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a very eclectic roster of acts. Was there anything in particular you were looking for when picking them?</strong><br/>
We were looking for acts that were simultaneously musically innovative, engaging live performers and who had an interesting perspective on their craft and other matters relating to their creative output. The acts and artists we have selected for this year&#8217;s festival are also linked into Sound Summit&#8217;s conference program, and we wanted to work with artists who could incorporate their ideals and performance methodologies into Sound Summit&#8217;s panel and workshop component. </p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the This Is Not Art showcase gigs.</strong><br/>
The two This Is Not Art showcase gigs this year have been co-programmed by Sound Summit and Electrofringe festivals. They take place at the Cambridge Hotel on October 2 and 3. These two performances will feature sonically diverse but aesthetically consistent acts from across Australia, including Qua, Free Choice Duo, Aoi, Bum Creek, Ten Thousand Free Men &amp; Their Families and Toecutter. As well as the Australian acts performing at these shows, there&#8217;s also international headliners including Vivian Girls (US), Ducktails (US), Pumice (NZ), ILIOS (Greece) and DJ Ripley (US). </p>
<blockquote><p>?Hair of the dog and aerobics workouts are two things that are usually mutually exclusive. Combining these two things, while an extremely flawed idea on paper, is realistic, practical and necessary at the halfway point of a weekend-long festival.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What prompted the New Weird Australia collaboration? And tell us more about the event.</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve been in regular contact with Stuart Buchanan and Danny Jumpertz since they conceived New Weird Australia, and believe that there&#8217;s a fair amount of common ground between what they are aiming to achieve and what we are. The New Weird Australia event itself is going to be a massive one, pretty much a mini-festival within Sound Summit. New Weird Australia is running over eight hours on October 4. It features 11 bands and two DJs performing in three different performance venues, including a former Freemasons clubhouse and a de-consecrated church. The New Weird Australia event features a wide variety of musical forms, with the consistent link being independence and a distinctly individualistic ?Australianness?.</p>
<p><strong>How does the discussion component of Sound Summit differ from other industry talkfests?</strong><br/>
The focus of Sound Summit&#8217;s discussions are altogether more practical and suited to independent artists than other conferences. They have a realistic focus on the community and collaborative aspects of creativity over get-rich-and-famous quick schemes. Another point of distinction is that Sound Summit&#8217;s daytime discussion program is completely free, with no pre-registration required.</p>
<p><strong>Give us your panel picks for each day.</strong><br/>
Friday: Creative Communities [TPI Auditorium, 2pm-4pm] provides a forum for exploring how communities form around music, what sustains them and why they exist. It features perspectives from collectives including alowhum (NZ), Spanish Magic (Newcastle) and Ladyfest Brisbane.</p>
<p>Saturday: CDR Sessions [Festival Club, 5pm-7pm]. Already hugely successful in Sydney, this session invites producers, musicians and appreciators of futuristic sounds together to hear unreleased music on a big sound system. All are welcome, but if you are a maker of music we invite you to bring along a CDR of your own works and be part of it. This session will feature Cornel Wilczek and James Cecil of Qua in interview, talking about their production process.</p>
<p>Sunday: Morality, Music and Money [TPI Auditorium, 12-2pm] promises to be a highlight, with panelists including DJ Ripley and Stuart Buchanan (Creative Sydney, New Weird Australia) disseminating the ethics of downloading, advertising and creative commons licensing. </p>
<p>Monday: Music Industry 101 and Speed Date The Music Industry [TPI Auditorium, 2pm-4pm]. A panel of industry experts answer all your burning questions, demystify the processes of the music industry and everything else you wanted to ask. It&#8217;s like an informative wine and dine, except without the hassle of actually having to offer to pay for the cheque.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3006549/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
<strong>What discussion are you personally most looking forward to?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m personally most looking forward to Know Your Gadgets, an artist presentation taking place on October 4 [TAFE worksheds, 3pm-5:30pm]  featuring Alex Yabsley (Dot.AY), Cornel Wilczek, Kris Keogh (Blastcorp) and Tim Shiel (Faux Pas) discussing their unique approaches to production techniques and live performance. All four panelists have interesting perspectives on what they do, and it should result in an interactive discussion that is a lot less dry than many ?production workshops?.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect any panel discussions to get particularly heated?</strong><br/>
Our panelists and facilitators are all lovely people, so I&#8217;m hoping not. I think that Morality, Music and Money has the potential to get a bit heated though, as any discussion involving downloading, personal responsibility, ethics and the ?correct? way to move forward in an arguably contracting industry, is bound to provoke passionate responses.</p>
<p><strong>I have to ask about the Sunday morning fitness session. What&#8217;s the idea behind that?</strong>  </p>
<p>Hair of the dog and aerobics workouts are two things that are usually mutually exclusive. Combining these two things, while an extremely flawed idea on paper, is realistic, practical and necessary at the halfway point of a weekend-long festival. Plus, it&#8217;s an acceptable reason to be up before midday on a Sunday. We&#8217;re a festival of endurance!</p>
<p><strong>Why was it so important to make all these events all-ages?</strong><br/>
Having the majority of Sound Summit&#8217;s events both free and all-ages is important to democratise the creative processes and machinations surrounding music for a wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope the conference achieves?</strong><br/>
I hope that after the festival people can come away from the conference with an increased awareness of the benefits of community, collaboration and innovation when following your creative goals. I&#8217;d like to think that Sound Summit&#8217;s program this year encourages skill-sharing, working together and developing new creative partnerships, rather than any unnecessary and counterproductive sense of competition.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, give our readers a quick pitch: why should they shell out the clams and travel to Newcastle? Your time starts now?</strong><br/>
Sound Summit will be an awesome party weekend of passionate people performing and talking about music, and a rare opportunity for both presenters and punters to be equally engaged about a slew of interesting topics. Also, If you have a short attention span, Newcastle will be full of good-looking and friendly creative people, some fine microbreweries and a lovely beach. Flights are cheap and accommodation is still available.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
