                <h3>For ex-Taswegian <strong>TOM LYNGCOLN</strong> (Harmony, The Nation Blue), Melbourne&#8217;s Arthouse was a dingy home away from home. The venue is <a href="/news/4215365">shutting its doors</a> this Sunday (May 1) after 20 years of operation.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020176/448x304-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
A couple of weeks ago my new band Harmony took to the stage of The Arthouse for the first time in a desperate effort to play the place at least once before its imminent demise. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why it was so important to do so when The Nation Blue had played the pub well over 25 times in the last decade. It started a chemical reaction in my cranial cavity akin to nostalgia as I tried to ascertain what it was about the Royal Artillery Hotel that was so significant.</p>
<p>It took me a while to come around to the place. I had heard about it through fellow Hobartians, who were fortunate enough to tour the mainland, as a venue that was always a guaranteed show in a town where shows were hard to come by. It seemed too easy even to me and I figured there had to be a catch, so I just kinda ignored it as a valid option for a couple of years. We left the island, struggled for shows and eventually landed one at The Arthouse supporting Blueline Medic in early 2001. </p>
<p>My first time through the doors left me feeling conflicted: k-hole inducing walls; a hate crime of a toilet; a big fucking pillar in the middle of the room about 10 metres from the stage that created one hell of a clusterfuck bottleneck; a roof that reminded me of the time my dad took me to see <em>Crocodile Dundee 2* and the cinema had strapped fishing nets to the ceiling filled with manikin arms and legs and red cotton wool to advertise *The Blob</em>, which gave me nightmares until I turned 27; and the best crowd we played to since leaving Van Diemen&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The people who ran the place were amazing. They gave us Tasmanian beer, sat on the door for us and didn&#8217;t take a single cent from the door price and still don&#8217;t to this day. They talked to us about music the same way people on the island did, with passion and little concern for financial enterprise. People danced for the first Australian time and told us about bands we&#8217;d never heard of and how we sounded like them &#8211; later revealed to be pretty disappointing, but only upon reflection of the dubious nature of our own output, more so than the inaccuracy of their signposts. There was no security to refuse me entry back in during load out because I smelled like the tip or dressed like a bum or had blood on my face. Hell, people helped you load out or would stand guard at the car while you went back for more.</p>
<p>We found a home away from home at this pub and its tentacles took us around the country countless times through a network of likeminded heads. We&#8217;d hit the outer-reaches, often dabbling with other scenes and venues (most notably <a href="/articles/4129579">The Punters</a> and The Tote) but always ended up playing the Arty bi-annually and some years even more. </p>
<p>I never really subscribed to the hardcore scene with blanket acceptance. I had seen some over enthusiastic dance-related behaviour and a few opportunistic kapos trying to wring every available dollar from a largely DIY community, where others worked tirelessly to support and foster. And maybe most ominously I despised the majority of the contemporary American music that many idolised. But these were slights upon an otherwise productive and motivated community of men and women and more so symptomatic of discrepancies in my own personal outlook. The people that I loved in that community I knew could be found under one roof on any given weekend.</p>

<p/>
<p>The Arthouse felt more like a family home than a pub. And as a new citizen to the big country I longed for the <em>Cheers</em> scenario and found it there. The Kelly family took possession of the pub in 1991 and their reluctance to pander to the music industry resulted in direct contact with bands and offered an opportunity for many new and inexperienced artists to play their first shows. While synonymous with punk and metal, bands like The Living End and Augie March played their first Melbourne shows at The Arthouse. A constant contact with bands forged strong relationships and communities grew. The people who played there also worked there and the Kelly extended family flourished. By the time we first witnessed it, it was thriving and comprised of people we had a lot of respect for.</p>
<p>It was more than a venue or just an empty shell populated at nightfall for the purpose of punishing brain cells. People behaved differently there and while not devoid of trouble, the place never employed security. There was no one to rally against, the community would absorb and resolve the issues. The authority figures were absent so escalation was difficult. After a tiresome day at a <a href="/articles/4180238">festival at the Showgrounds</a> earlier this year watching old men with long hair play half as fast as they once did, my comrade and I decided to forgo the final death throes of the headlining act&#8217;s equine doldrums to jump a train back into the city to watch Extortion at The Arthouse. They were the best band we saw that day. More brutal, uncompromising and terrifying than anything else we endured. </p>
<p>I probably stood too close with my handbag and an overenthusiastic lad became entangled in the straps and couldn&#8217;t free himself from my nets. Thrashing like an oceanic scavenger in a ghost net, I struggled to release him from the noose but eventually managed to manipulate his face and free him. He caterwauled across the room like a starfish from a slingshot and bounced back towards us reprimanding the guy standing next to me for being ?a whacker? or some such slur. He felt he had been treated unjustly and demanded satisfaction from the backpacked innocent. His efforts were met with laughter from everyone within earshot and I pointed to my handbag and apologised for the slack in the straps matching the relative narrow proportions of his head. </p>

<p/>
<p>The realisation that his particular trajectory, while effective in most establishments selling alcohol, would be this time met with smiles and derision reset his course for the front of the stage to expel his energy more positively. And this is how The Arthouse operated successfully without need for alpha employment. Laws of nature over some authoritarian bent. Everyone looked after each other and if things got out of control and people began acting like children, they would be reprimanded by a stern mother figure in co-owner Maree, with the rest of the pub behind her. There was a state of balance in the room that made it safe for the kids to frequent, which also ensured its continued popularity. That&#8217;s not to say that it was sterile &#8211; far from it, as our first attempt to play show there with my new band Harmony would prove. </p>
<p>Not getting a chance to play a venue that had been so important to my experience of Melbourne would be a criminal oversight. So we leeched our way onto a line-up featuring two touring internationals. A week out from the show, the headliner pulled out, which didn&#8217;t really concern me as I had never had a lot of time for this particular Swede, who like the majority of his country folk tended to operate as a carbon copier of more interesting bands from other places. But it would prove to be a problematic loss for the venue, on a Friday night in their last month of operation. The remainder of the line-up was intact and everyone decided to forge ahead regardless. After a particularly brutal day at work I slunk home reluctantly wanting to leave the compound to play the show. My wife felt the same way but we loaded up the car and whinged our way to the corner of Queensberry and Elizabeth Streets. </p>
<p>I carried the first handful of bullshit in through the doors to see about 80-100 heads and continued straight into band room, through the door I loved to boot. There on the couch of the former kitchen/band room sat two dudes and a girl giving each other ghetto hand tattoos of pirate ships and dogs. Without putting anything down I spun around and walked straight back out and left everything beside the stage. There in front of the stage, dancing pants-less, was a French backpacker who had pissed himself. One of the upstairs tenants had kindly lent him some boxer shorts for the evening, soiled jeans in one hand, beer in the other. His partner down the back was attempting to kiss any girl she was able to corner and would occasionally venture to the front of the stage to offer bilingual heckles to those who occupied it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?As a new citizen to the big country I longed for the &#8216;Cheers&#8217; scenario and found it there.?</p></blockquote>
<p>We set up and played and had a great time. The comfortable layout of the room with that big fucking pillar dividing it in two, acted like an enclosure and everyone inside it had a rowdy time despite the miserable nature of the music. Three quarters of the way through the set we watched from the stage as an ambulance stretched off the American headliner who had overdosed on cough syrup and fallen down the stairs. Due back in rehab the following week he had to decided to go for broke, leaving us to pad out the rest of our set in an effort to compensate for his absence. Needless to say the evening wrapped up around 11.30pm. People were too busy having fun to care and only a small proportion accepted refunds offered. One large older man who arrived late while we were packing down seemed a little distressed though and sat behind the mixing desk crying. Maybe upset at missing the show I asked him if he was alright or wanted a refund and the tears erupted into a hail of spew at his feet before running off into the night still crying. It was the best night! I wish that it could have been my final memory of the place; bulldozed in my mind the next day. It didn&#8217;t matter if nothing went right, it was good fun.</p>
<p>I returned on Friday night to watch Mid Youth Crisis play for the last time. One of my favourite mainland bands, MYC and support Conation, were ridiculously good and I wish that could have been my final memory of the place. Unfortunately I have two more final encounters: tonight (April 27) with The Nation Blue and at the final show on Saturday night. By Sunday, Melbourne will have lost somewhat of an institution and I hope that Maree, Mel, Matt, Dave, Amanda and Simpson all land alright and end up in a new room to plug what will be a pretty significant hole in the Melbourne music community. I applaud them all for running something so unique for so long and for inviting us to be a part of it.</p>
