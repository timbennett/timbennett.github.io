                <h3>Songs about heartbreak, loss and psychic mums &#8211; <strong>OSCAR SLORACH-THORN<em>* and *</em>MARTIN KING</strong> (aka Oscar + Martin) lead us through their debut album ?For You?.
</h3>
<h2>?My Blood?</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3020880/441x391-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Oscar: I started singing this one while walking to the North Melbourne train station. It was dry and warm. The lyrics initially had lots of imagery from a Gabrielle Garcia Marquez book too. So I was sitting at the station and was writing in a little note book wearing a full brown suit I used to wear when I worked as an integration aid at a school. This strange guy about 15 comes up to me and asks if he can sit with me. I say, ?Of course.? He seems very socially injured and unconfident. He asks me if I&#8217;m a writer, and I say no. Then he asked me if I&#8217;m a whole list of things. Eventually he asks me how to find what you are good at and what you believe in. He was very lost. He asked if I had a girlfriend (I did at the time). He then asked me hundreds of questions about how to make someone fall for you. He seemed to think girls were a mythical city in the sky.</p>
<p>On the train I asked him where he was going. He explained that he had just been catching the train all day every day back and forth since he was 12. It helps him with his anxiety. On the train he felt calm; making transient friends. The creepy thing was he had the exact same eyes as me.</p>
<p>So anyway back to the song! At some point I disappointed my girl. So, in all earnestness, later that day I sang ?My Blood? to her word-for-word to try and win back her fancy; as a gesture of devotion. It was what I would want to hear. Since that first little performance I have sung it stacks of times and over different arrangements. To be honest it takes a lot of courage to keep singing it now. On the album version Hazel Brown sings, ?Oh I like yellow light&#8221;, in response to my, ?My pretty girl my one girl.? This is me acknowledging my foolishness. People enjoy life because of colours and smells and fun, and I ruined that by thinking too much. I am embarrassed for sounding so committed and so staunch.</p>

<h2>?Chain Maile?</h2>
<p>Oscar: There are three recordings of this song. The first was very tape-based with lots of slightly-out [Casio] SK-1 vocal sample parts, toy drums and field recordings from a dictaphone. It ends with a collage of different recordings cutting in and out and then finishes with Martin and I talking about a Wu-Tang comic (I found that a bit hilarious at the time). Martin and I later described this version as the, &#8220;Art school version.? At the time I was falling hard and fast for a girl. I had been very guarded since my previous girlfriend through high school, and was very nervous about falling in love because I knew the risks. The lyrics, &#8220;I&#8217;m clad in chain maile, falling for you, unclasp my armour and hand it over to you?, represent taking down barriers, bearing all so as to truly be there fragile and true for someone.</p>
<p>The second recording I made with a freshly broken heart. It has the extra ?no don&#8217;t go? part. On a mission, I rode into the studio at RMIT at about 11 at night and recorded the whole thing. It was very cathartic to sing in that state, to express myself and focus on something. I remember riding home to a sunrise. It&#8217;s always great riding through Brunswick [in Melbourne] at sunrise because of the hot air balloons. Martin took care of the drum sounds well on this one. The samples of vocals holding chords are taken from the second version. There is a beauty in that. I feel like while singing this version I was calm and had perspective, and was interacting with my slightly younger self.</p>

<h2>?Oyster?</h2>
<p>Oscar: I wrote the lyrics and melody for this one while riding through snowy Kyoto. My eyes were always wide then, but I would still sing to myself. There&#8217;s imagery from conversations I had, but mostly there is content relating to re-occurring dreams and fantasies. For instance, when I was a small boy I would always dream of an endless pack of wolves running through the pass next to my house. When I think of this dream it makes me think of when my grandma took me to see <em>The Lion King</em>. During the scene where there is a stampede I became overwhelmed by the sound. I held my ears screaming and my grandma had to take me out. </p>
<p>This makes me think of holding onto a rope in a river in monsoon season and letting the water pound against you; which makes me think of this thing that happens to me where when I close my eyes and heaps of black lines pass by really fast making me squint. </p>
<p>When I returned to Melbourne I demoed the song on a 4-track using Casio bongo sounds and stuff. Then it was played in [former band] Psuche. In that arrangement there was a long intro that had Steve Reich&#8217;s <em>New York Counterpoint</em>-esque clarinet and saxophone. The version on the album developed slowly. Martin reworked the song over and over adding to and taking away the beats. The drums at the end we recorded in tandem. There is a lot of live energy when we record percussion together. It&#8217;s really fun.</p>

<h2>?Lions Heart?</h2>
<p>Oscar: A close friend of mine had just moved to Paris to go busking and live like a gypsy.  He left me his 12 string guitar to take care of. I had been really uninspired by guitar for the last year and had had only been playing an acoustic occasionally. Anyway i got tottally obsessed with the 12 string, the way dudes get about cars or bikes, the way you can love an object or tool. So i was always fooling around on it. The lyrics came out because i was feeling really hurt and like my essential character was being seriously challenged, like i was on the verge of metamorphosis into something i didn&#8217;t want to be. This is me being proud and trying to feel empowered. </p>

<p/>
<h2>?What I Know?</h2>
<p>Martin: The main hook of this song kind of came out of nowhere, and stuck itself firmly in my brain. Although these lyrics at first seemed nonsensical, they took on a certain meaning of their own. Basically it&#8217;s about wanting the person you love to act for you, and do for you, over their own needs (despite potentially making a situation worse). As you might have gathered from reading this ?track by track?, Oscar has been through a bit of heart break recently, so my verse is in a sense sympathising with his situation at the time. Bec Rigby&#8217;s heart-melting vocal chords give voice to the female perspective in this song, creating the boy/girl call response.

<h2>?All I Think About?</h2>
<p>Oscar: My mum thinks she is psychic. For real! Sometimes I think she is too. Anyway, I&#8217;m not psychic but sometimes when I have a crush on someone (I swear this is true), I can sense them. When I wrote this song, that week a bunch of times I basically just got off a tram at the wrong stop, or left class to stand in a particular spot or randomly started running in a direction, and would bump into this girl who I couldn&#8217;t get out of my head at the time. It was so cool! The Darth Vadar line is about how she could potentially do that strangle move he does. I&#8217;m aware I sound really silly. </p>

<h2>?Milk?</h2>
<p>Oscar: This track was the last to be finished. In terms of tracking and writing I did very little. Mardi [Martin] gave the song to me with a gap for my verse. I listened to it with headphones on repeat on breaks from working on production on other tracks, just to get out of the studio and rest my eyes. I was writing from the perspective of someone lost in the desert having visions.</p>

<h2>?Recognise?</h2>
<p>Oscar: I first wrote this song the day after a friend&#8217;s funeral. I had been really inspired by his beautiful mother, her sadness and her positivity. I played it for one of my close friends. She had known him really well; it was my way of trying to comfort her. I recorded it to tape playing an organ with one hand and a floor tom with the other along to the same tape loop of my pitched up voice that made it on the album.</p>

<h2>?Party Time Is Scary?</h2>
<p>Oscar: This song is about a day at work when I worked as an integration aid. One of the boys I took care of was clinically afraid of balloons. It&#8217;s called Globophobia. He and I discussed how hard this made birthday parties in the morning. At recess, a seven-year-old boy who was dressed in a spider man costume (with fake muscles and everything) was furious and upset. He was being picked on for his costume. It took a really long time to calm him down. Another boy always used to go on and on about how he could destroy me and how he had super powers. </p>
<p>The lyrics feature the exact words I exchanged with a little autistic boy at lunchtime. I remember it clearly. There was something very moving about him. It&#8217;s hard to explain. So on this particular lunch duty, some of the other kids came to get me because on the other side of the grounds he was running amok with a big branch. He had already seriously hurt a little girl who had been taken to the sickbay. I eventually had him cornered after chasing him for ages. I told him he had to come with me and that he was going to apologise to the injured girl. When I took him by the hand that&#8217;s when he started to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t drag me under water&#8221;, over and over. I told him I was trying to help. When I let go he ran to his scooter and was gone. Meetings were called with his parents and then it was out of my control.</p>

<h2>?Do The Right Thing?</h2>
<p>Oscar: When you split up with someone, sometimes it feels like everything you thought you had couldn&#8217;t have been real if the other person can live without you. I have only been truly in love twice, but both times one of the parties was left feeling this way. When I wrote this song that&#8217;s how I was feeling. </p>
<p>I guess I initially sang it along to a beat I made with toy piano and really heavy kicks and claps in a more contemporary style. For me, every break up (I&#8217;m only 20, but I&#8217;m talking like a jaded old man!) has had a soundtrack. Every romance, in fact. At this time of heartache all I could listen too was old soul stuff for some reason: Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, the list goes on. So I transposed the track onto the 12-string and made it a lot higher so that it was in falsetto. That&#8217;s the version we ended up using on the album. </p>
<p>When I was recording the vocals for this track, I set up the sessions so it would record on loop. I&#8217;d go into the booth to record it over and over until I felt I had done a good take, or a bunch of good bits to cut together. I sang it countless times maybe 20 times through, really giving it my all (I honestly thought if it was good enough I could win her back). Eventually I felt content and went into the studio to listen back to what I had done, but I had set up the routing wrong and none of the takes had properly recorded. It was such a horrible feeling. I felt like I had put everything I had out there for nothing. I decided to do one or two more takes before I called it a day to try and feel like I had at least done something. I didn&#8217;t listen to them back. I just went straight home feeling like a loser. Next day I came back in and listened back, and was really happy and surprised. The vocal on the album is a mixture of just those two takes. The tone to me is so desperate but equally apathetic.</p>
