<img class="c" data-src="/images/3003131/640x426-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="426"/>
<p>If you think reviewing a gig from the comfort of a lounge room is a cop-out, consider this. In 1992, along with 49,816 other people including my parents, I witnessed Sir Paul McCartney live in concert at the MCG. It was my first taste of arena rock &#8211; and it sucked. </p>
<p>From the nosebleeds in the (not-so) Great Southern Standard, P-Mac was pea-esque as he ambled his way through Beatles medleys, Wings favourites (a particularly bombastic ?Live and Let Die? complete with fireworks) and tracks off his newly released LP, the eminently forgettable <em>Off The Ground</em>. While he couldn&#8217;t be faulted for his showmanship &#8211; he played ?Hey Jude? on an illuminated piano that floated into the ?G? on a wire &#8211; it was lost on such a grand stage. The sound swirled around like a plastic bag on a windy day, and I spent most of the night wishing I brought my Walkman.</p>
<p>The MCG may be hallowed turf for cricket, footy and monster trucks, but it&#8217;s a terrible venue for live music. And so, in the interests of decent coverage &#8211; the likes of which you don&#8217;t receive when you&#8217;re on Level 4 with 80,000+ punters screaming in your ear &#8211; I decided to make a donation and take in the Sound Relief benefit shows live on <em>Channel [V]</em>. Armed with more dips than a personal training session, I settled in for some 10 hours of unscripted Aussie rock and good old-fashioned jingoism. And I&#8217;ll be damned if it wasn&#8217;t some of the best TV since, well, Live8.</p>
<p>After a montage of floods and fire to remind us why we&#8217;re all here (no, it&#8217;s not just about Kings of Leon potentially playing <em>that</em> song about gonorrhea), Channel [V] presenter Renee&#8217;s voice is the first we hear. ?Hey!! And welcome to Sound Relief. We&#8217;re coming to you live from the MCG in Melbourne and this is going to be the most amazing day!! We are making history, I mean, it&#8217;s a once-in-a-lifetime line-up!!? </p>
<p>Co-presenter Danny (no surname either, who are these people?) concurs in a ?totes defo? kinda way.</p>
<p>?Behind us right now there are people teeming into the stadium.&#8221;<br/>
Does he mean streaming?<br/>
&#8220;And speaking of teeming &#8230;&#8221;<br/>
Guess not.<br/>
&#8220;&#8230; the rain is coming down like cats and dogs. It&#8217;s a sea of ponchos,<br/>
but they still have smiles on their faces &#8211; The day is going to be HUGE!?</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, our benevolent hosts &#8211; when they&#8217;re not fumbling microphones or botching interviews &#8211; remind us of the enormity of the occasion with words like ?absolutely going off?, ?massive? and ?historical?. And while it&#8217;s poorly expressed, they do have a point. The fact that 81,000 people &#8211; believed to be the biggest paying audience ever at an Australian concert event &#8211; braved Meredith-like conditions at the MCG, makes this a truly momentous event. Not to mention the reformation of four seminal antipodean acts: Hunters &amp; Collectors, Split Enz and Midnight Oil in Melbourne; Icehouse at a concurrent event at Sydney&#8217;s SCG.</p>
<p>After a typically waffled introduction by Molly Meldrum, <strong>Jet</strong> took to the stage, playing one of two performances for the day. (They would later be teleported to Sydney for an evening performance at the SCG). With a quick ?Melbourne, are you ready??, the band took their first tentative steps back into the live arena with a run of hits and near-hits including ?Rip It Up?, the obligatory ?Are You Gonna Be My Girl? and ?Look What You&#8217;ve Done?, which prompted the first crowd singalong of the day. The band even had time to unveil new single ?She&#8217;s A Genius? before saying goodbye to the PG-rated crowd with ?Cold Hard Bitch?.</p>
<p>But just as an underwhelming performance by teen pop sensation <strong>Gabriella Cilmi<em>* had me scurrying for the remote, the moment that these benefit shows can only conjure came. A quick live cross to Sydney saw **John Farnham**, backed by UK megastars *</em>Coldplay</strong> for his 1986 hit ?You&#8217;re The Voice?; a song described by singer Chris(t) Martin as Australia&#8217;s ?national anthem?. </p>
<p>Was this real life?</p>
<p>Still, there were more surprises to come. <strong>Liam Finn</strong>?s curious mid-afternoon slot proved to be a ruse. After two songs with ex-Tin Lid Eliza-Jane Barnes, he invited the ?family band &#8211; little brother Elroy, uncle Nick <a href="http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3513404">Seymour] and N-Dog [his dad, Neil Finn]? onto the stage for a Crowded House reunion of sorts. The ?band?, who played a similar surprise show at [Camp A Low Hum</a> last month, sent the crowd wild with ?Don&#8217;t Dream It&#8217;s Over?, ?Weather With You? (with Tim Finn) and ?Better Be Home Soon?.</p>
<p>The afternoon also saw performances by <strong>Augie March<em>*; **Paul Kelly** backed by Even&#8217;s Ash Naylor for a greatest hits set (plus a stirring a capella version of ?Meet Me In The Middle of the Air?); and hip-hop duo *</em>Bliss N Eso</strong>, who had the cornball moment of the day when they asked the crowd to ?pose? for the cover of their next live album. Wasn&#8217;t this supposed to be a show about altruism not opportunism?</p>
<p>Bum notes aside, Andrew Stockdale proved there&#8217;s life after Chris Ross and Myles Heskett with <strong>Wolfmother Mk II</strong> (a four-piece that includes Stockdale, guitarist Aiden Nemeth, bass/keyboard player Ian Peres and drummer Dave Atkins). No new material was unveiled in their second show of the day (like Jet, they were ferried between Melbourne and Sydney), but the crowd eagerly lapped up old favourites ?Woman?, ?White Unicorn? and ?Joker and the Thief?.</p>
<p>Another cross to Sydney for ?star of countless films? Toni Collette who thankfully didn&#8217;t sing, but introduced a direct satellite link-up to princes William and Harry from the UK. The pair, who have some of the deepest speaking voices I&#8217;ve ever heard, read a statement off a teleprompter presumably before a polo game, or a cameo on <em>Aussie Ladette to Lady</em>.</p>
<p>One minute&#8217;s silence was respectfully &#8211; and emotionally &#8211; observed before it was back to Melbourne for the 7.40pm surprise: <strong>Kylie<em>*. Her spirited rendition of ?Still Call Australia Home? (in a faux British accent no less) gave way to the classic Aus/NZ rock triumvirate of **Hunters &amp; Collectors**, **Split Enz** and *</em>Midnight Oil</strong>. All three bands reunited especially for the event &#8211; and while some were more polished than others (Split Enz last played in 2008), they all sounded vital and fresh. ?Hunnas?, the band least likely to reform, admittedly ?roughed? their way through ?Where The River Runs Dry?, ?Holy Grail? and ?Throw Your Arms Around Me? (cue singalong #26 for the afternoon) while Split Enz played their quirky pop hits (?I See Red?, ?I Got You?, ?Six Months In a Leaky Boat?) resplendent in psych-ward chic.</p>
<p>After two <a href="http://www.messandnoise.com/events/2000507#review_3546177">?warm-up? shows</a> in Canberra, Midnight Oil took to the main stage like they never left it. Peter Garrett may now be a government minister but he&#8217;s still one of rock&#8217;s great frontmen, spaz dancing his way through classics including ?Beds are Burning?, ?Read About It?, ?Blue Sky Mining?, ?The Dead Heart? and ?The Power and The Passion? (a song about Sydney that the band Melbourne-ised just for the night). </p>
<p>There was, however, one brief moment when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts turned up instead. After returning for an encore, Garrett couldn&#8217;t help but address the crowd like some sort of collective Mr Speaker: ?Thank you very very much everybody. And as I said before in my other remarks, it&#8217;s been a real privilege to come down and play this show.? A rendition of ?Sometimes? followed and that was it.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit show since WaveAid? You bet. But I still don&#8217;t wish I was there.</p>
