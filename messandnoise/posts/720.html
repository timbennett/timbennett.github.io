                <h3>At the inaugural Harvest at Melbourne&#8217;s Werribee Park, <strong>DARREN LEVIN<em>* discovers some things are worth queuing up for; others, not so much. Photos by *</em>GREG BRICKNELL</strong>.
</h3>
<p>A civilised gathering is what was promised &#8211; and on this point the inaugural Harvest Festival overwhelmingly delivered. Walking through the gates at Melbourne&#8217;s Werribee Park at midday was a comparative breeze. No huge Big Day Out-style queues. No oppressive strongmen herding you into pens like lambs to the slaughter. No shirtless bogans with wrap-around Oakleys chastitising you for not kissing the flag. A couple disinterested looking cops. Two sniffer dogs chillin? on the grass. A designer raincoat stall on a perfect spring day. I guess it&#8217;s why they call this festival ?boutique?.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024934/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Werribee Park &#8211; located about 30 kilometres from Melbourne&#8217;s CBD in a suburb best known for being a ?shit farm? &#8211; is a stunning location for a festival. Perfectly manicured gardens opening up to a huge pond; lots of native flora; and plenty of natural shade, which certainly differs from Flemington Racecourse or even the Footscray Community Arts Centre, which is home to Harvest&#8217;s direct competitor <a href="/articles/4186731">Laneway</a>. It&#8217;s a wonder no one&#8217;s attempted to hold a festival here in the past, but they were probably put off by its size 14 Achilles? heel: transport.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024936/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Werribee Train station isn&#8217;t accessible by foot, meaning free shuttle buses were arranged to ferry people to and from the festival. This was the suggested means of travel, until an unexpected <a href="/news/4368548">about face</a> by organisers less than 48 hours before the festival told us we should drive or charter a bus if we wanted to stay and watch headliners The Flaming Lips. People got anxious.</p>
<p>The message however, seemed to get through. Festival-goers arrived in mini-buses, which they independently chartered; maxi-cabs; cars; and even stretch Hummers. There was ample free parking too &#8211; at Werribee Park itself and the nearby Equestrian Centre &#8211; despite a park employee telling me the day before he expected things to get ?pretty ugly?. At the end of the festival, the closing clusterfuck that some predicted didn&#8217;t exactly materialise. Yes, people looked confused and it took a while to shift everyone out, but intrepid promoter AJ Maddah lived up to his word that no punter would be left behind (save, of course, for the poor souls who actually call Werribee home).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say Harvest went off without a hitch. There were long snaking lines for just about every amenity &#8211; from the food to the unisex toilets. Men, however, could take advantage of an ingenious teepee-like urinal, which offered relative privacy, and was reportedly used at Maddah&#8217;s other festival, Soundwave. Women had to hold it in. </p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024937/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>The drink coupon lines at the start of the day were truly out of control. Bars, on the other hand, were well-personed, but with no coupons to buy drinks, staff essentially sat around doing nothing. That model shifted as the day went on. At the festival&#8217;s peak, you could easily spend an entire set in line for a drink, while those stationed at the now-empty coupon stands, could only look on helplessly. At the Big Red Tractor Stage, the issue was particularly pronounced. The close proximity of the bar to the viewing area, meant drink queues literally bisected the crowd. As always, Maddah took to <a href="twitter.com/iamnotshoutingCached">Twitter</a> to express his rage at the ?food and bev people? who were ?fucking attrocious (sic)?. He neglected to mention he hired them.</p>
<p>And then, the unthinkable happened. At 4pm, with more than six hours of festival time left, Harvest Melbourne ran out of beer. And then cider. And then Smirnoff Mules. A couple options of pre-mixed cans remained, but cost three coupons per drink, instead of two. Leaving the festival with a pocketful of worthless coupons became a real possibility. To his credit, and in a show of good faith, Maddah has since agreed (via Twitter, naturally) to refund one punter&#8217;s unused coupons, but the question still remains: why do festivals continue to persist with this system?</p>
<p>When things threatened to boil over &#8211; there would&#8217;ve been a riot at the Big Day Out &#8211; the perfectly paced, albeit <a href="/news/4365908">much-fussed over</a> music program managed to keep everything zen. Soundwave leftovers <strong>This Town Needs Guns<em>* were a hard rock anomaly on a bill that drew heavily on indie&#8217;s softer centre. Playing the small Big Tractor Stage, *</em>The Holidays</strong> were one of four Australian bands on the line-up, a disappointing return for a festival of this scale. All bands were from Australia&#8217;s music capital Sydney, which may&#8217;ve explained their collective dance sensibilities and less-than-average dress sense.</p>
<p>Playing songs from their debut album <em>Post Paradise</em>, plus some new tracks (?We always use festivals to try out dodgy new songs,? said lead Holiday Simon Jones?), The Holidays have become festival mainstays and it&#8217;s still unclear why. Another underwhelming performance like last year&#8217;s <a href="/articles/4186731">Laneway</a> that left all but six of the crowd standing (the rest sat politely, presumably to get some respite from the sun). ?You wouldn&#8217;t catch Portishead doing that,? Jones said after the lite-funk of ?Indian Summer Anniversary?. No, you most certainly would not.</p>
<p>A quick dash across to The Great Lawn for <strong>Hypnotic Brass Ensemble<em>*, who did an admirable job of kicking the crowd into life with their fusion of hip-hop and horns (and some left-stage, right-stage crowd participation no less). *</em>The Family Stone</strong> followed, but without the troubled Sly or his sister Rose, it came across more like a Vegas revue than anything resembling the iconic funk-soul band. ?Dance To The Music? still went off.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024935/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>The last time I saw <strong>Dappled Cities</strong> they were at the height of their powers, sporting <a href="/articles/3860894">?gold, heat-conducting jumpsuits?</a> and totally nailing a mid-afternoon set at Laneway. This time, they wore shirts and jeans, and were clearly taking some tentative steps back after some extended time off. ?It feels like we haven&#8217;t played in a million years,? singer Tim Derricourt joked, before apologising for their forthcoming forth album taking ?fucking aaaaages?. They played a couple new songs from said album, including a space-prog number with nice Beatlesy harmonies, as well as the one-two-punch of ?Vision Bell? and ?Fire Fire Fire? from 2006?s <em>Granddance</em>.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024938/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>?We&#8217;re playing some late night songs on a sunny afternoon,? <strong>Mercury Rev&#8217;s<em>* Jonathan Donahue told the crowd over at the muddy and stinky Windmill Stage. It could&#8217;ve easily applied to The National over at The Great Lawn; or predecessors, New York&#8217;s *</em>The Walkmen</strong>, who came across as a thinking man&#8217;s Coldplay and deserve some credit for keeping their suits on in such extreme heat. Sorry Beth Gibbons, but singer Hamilton Leithauser easily held the longest note of the day. After incessant crowd prompting, they played ?The Rat?.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024939/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Back to Mercury Rev, who&#8217;ve been playing 1998 epic <em>Deserter&#8217;s Songs* in full recently, but settled for a ?greatest hits? set including the majestic ?Holes?, a reworked version of ?Endlessly?, ?Car Wash Hair? (from 1991?s *Yerself Is Steam</em>) and a cover of Peter Gabriel&#8217;s ?Solsbury Hill?. The evergreen Donahue was as theatric as ever, casting spells on guitarist Grasshopper and conducting a very handsome and potent rhythm section. Former bandmates The Flaming Lips were looking on/taking notes side of stage. Mercury Rev get bonus points for using a smoke machine during the day.</p>
<p/>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3024940/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p/>
<p>Oblivious to the drinks queue splitting their audience in two, <strong>PVT</strong> played a pulsating set in The Big Tractor Stage, which seemed to be running 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Drummer Laurenz Pike is still the band&#8217;s not-so secret weapon, while his brother Richard and Dave Miller are no slouches either, endlessly flitting between laptops, samplers, synths and bass. Amid the complex clutter, ?Window? from last year&#8217;s <em><a href="/releases/2000686">Church With No Magic</a></em> was an understated highlight.</p>
<p><strong>Seekae</strong> aren&#8217;t the most attractive live proposition &#8211; they&#8217;re essentially three guys on laptops &#8211; but Alex Cameron&#8217;s drumming gives the soundscapes from this year&#8217;s <em><a href="releases/2000843">+DOME</a></em> a sense of dynamism and physicality.</p>

<p>People were reportedly shedding tears to <strong>Bright Eyes?<em>* endless emoting over at The Great Lawn. He dedicated a song to ?all the scientists? in the crowd (based on the show of hands, there weren&#8217;t many) and finished on a jammy note with ?Road To Joy?. **The National** were as maudlin and moody as you&#8217;d expect from five be-suited Brooklynites, but they were a mere entree to the wonderfully dark and brooding dish served up by *</em>Portishead</strong>. Returning after a 14-year absence, their set was heightened by a clear spring night, an illuminated Werribee mansion spire and visuals that included laser beams shooting out of Tony Abbott&#8217;s eyes (see, not so serious after all). Beth Gibbons gets lost in a song unlike any other performer I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; she looked, for the most part, in immeasurable pain &#8211; and ?Roads? and ?Glory Box? were as stunning as when you first heard them, beautifully stoned, and 15.</p>

<p>Yet another band from Brooklyn, <strong>Phosphorescent</strong>, were openly contravening Portishead&#8217;s <a href="/news/4366144">requests for ?absolute silence?</a>, but it was kosher because it was happening out of earshot at the Red Tractor stage. They treated a sparse crowd to a fine set of ?sunny afternoon songs on a late night? (see what I did there?) and singer-songwriter Matthew Houck somehow manages to sound like a Simon, yet look like a Garfunkel. Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>The Flaming Lips</strong> closed off proceedings with a short set for those ?staying late? at the Windmill Stage, but not before a man who may or may not have been AJ, reassured us we&#8217;d all be getting home in one piece. The message was reiterated in a much more loveable and far less frazzled tone by Coyne, who reemerged with his bandmates in trademark fashion: from a vagina on a big screen. It&#8217;s a familiar sight for anyone who&#8217;s seen a Lips show over the past six years, but cynicism seems to go out the window when you&#8217;re being blasted with confetti and given life lessons from a 50-year-old man in a giant balloon. </p>
<p>They did ?She Don&#8217;t Use Jelly?, Steven Drozd played the iPhone, Michael Ivins sat motionless on a chair, Coyne did some self-help shtick, and before you knew it they were playing ?Do You Realize?? and sending people out in the night, scurrying like rats, to their respective modes of transport.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be some festival once they iron out the kinks.</p>
