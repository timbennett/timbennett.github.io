                <h3>In the final installment of their US tour diary, Otouto&#8217;s <strong>HAZEL<em>* and **MARTHA BROWN** and *</em>KISHORE RYAN</strong> reflect on an eye-opening five-and-a-bit weeks on the road with Castiotone for the Painfully Alone (aka US singer Owen Ashworth).
</h3>
<h2>Week Five &#8230; and a bit</h2>
<p><strong>Hazel:</strong> We arrived in Chicago exhausted. We gorged on Indian take-out. We ate on the floor of our hotel room and watched lots of TV, thinking it&#8217;d be amazing after not having watched any for four weeks, but it was actually a bit weird and boring. I shared a bed with Kishore for the first time and he made weird sounds with his teeth in the night.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3015930/440x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
On Tuesday we were back to alarms and deadlines. Owen picked us up at 9am to drive the three hours to record <a href="http://www.daytrotter.com/">Daytrotter</a> sessions with both Casiotone for the Painfully Alone and Otouto. The leaves were red and orange and the sun was out and three hours was not too bad compared to what we were used to. The Daytrotter guys helped Owen and I lift the gear up the stairs (there have been stupid amounts of stairs on this tour, I wish I&#8217;d counted them), which I was thankful for. Although, never having had muscles before, I was surprised at how things felt lighter since I&#8217;d developed a bit of definition. The studios were really pretty with lots of interesting instruments, vintage amps and great lighting. We recorded five tracks for each band were out of there by about 6pm.</p>
<p>The next day, Martha and I recorded vocals for a hip-hop artist called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/serengetiandpolyphonic">Serengeti</a>, whose album will be out next year through Anticon. Owen is producing a third of the album under his new name Advance Base, with the other thirds produced by Sufjan Stevens and Why?. We pressed our heads together and sung into the one microphone, sitting on the bed in Owen&#8217;s spare room.</p>
<p>The next morning we were on the road once more. In Kalamazoo, Michigan, we played to a college crowd, the show was part of the Barking Tuna Festival. I still don&#8217;t really know what the name means. King Khan and the Shrines headlined and we shared some of their rider, which included chips, vegies and dips, chocolate and yoghurt. People went mental for them, crowd surfing and getting up on stage dancing and sweating a lot. The band had one female member, who didn&#8217;t play an instrument, all she did was lift her hair up and put it over the front of her face and jiggle her hips a bit. I thought this was pretty crap.</p>
<p>Winooski, Vermont, was freezing and it gave us a shock. We met Lincoln, who opened the night and plays under the name Hello Shark. We loved his songs. The next night in Biddeford, Maine I watched Hello Shark support us again. He played in front of his mum and grandfather. He took some swear words out but forgot in one line, and accidentally dropped the F-bomb.</p>
<p>The venue was gorgeous, lit with naked light-bulbs and decorated with stickers of cartoon wrestlers. The owners were lovely people who made us sandwiches and gave us pumpkin choc-chip cookies. I ate eight of them in the car after the show. Too good.</p>
<p>We stayed in a friend of Owen&#8217;s place, about an hour out of town. The house was enormous and old, and had wall paper with baskets, bunnies and wreathes of fades flowers. It was also home to about a million cats. I was warned that if I wanted to go for a walk in the morning, to wear something bright because it was hunting season. I did go for a walk and I wore a white t-shirt because it was all I had, but it was cold so I wore my brown jumper over the top. This came off very quickly when I heard the first shot then I ran home trying my best not to look like a deer.</p>
<p>We finished the tour with the Ridgewood Masonic Temple show in Brooklyn, put on by Todd P (organizer/promoter of all-ages underground/DIY shows). It really was the perfect finale for the tour. The night was fun, seamless and problem free and I was inspired to put on more all ages-shows in Australia. It was sad to be finishing the tour but I also felt very ready. It has been eye-opening and inspiring, exhausting and draining, exciting and incredibly fun and ridiculous. I&#8217;d certainly come back, given the chance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now got a good amount of time in NYC to recover, stretch our legs and see other band&#8217;s shows. There are pumpkins on every doorstep, there are fake spiderwebs all over the fences, and inside bars and cafes and there is a pumpkin dish on every specials menu. I tried pumpkin pie ice-cream the other day, but am yet to try mashed pumpkin with marshmallows and pumpkin spice lattes.</p>

<strong>Kishore:</strong> After a month of performing and driving we had our first day off. My immune system decided it was the perfect day to get a cold. The next day we drove somewhere far away and did some recording and then drove back to Chicago and so it all began again, and I couldn&#8217;t really afford to be sick anymore and therefore I got better. Also my scabies marks began to fade as did the humiliating memories of the doctor who had examined me for $79. The doctor had looked at the itchy red marks on my toes, fingers, arms and stomach and said, &#8220;Wow! I wonder what they are? Let&#8217;s have a look in this book and see if we can find any pictures that look like what you&#8217;ve got.&#8221; The book was filled with pictures of all kinds of diseases on various body parts. At least half of the pictures depicted diseased genitals. &#8220;Oh my god! That&#8217;s really gross!&#8221; I kept saying. The doctor would giggle, agree with me and then turn the page to another photo. </p>
<p>As we crossed the Canadian border and I watched the yellows, oranges and reds of the passing trees the memory of doctor dissolved. However, every now and again I&#8217;d remember how Hazel (who had been writing a list of all the bad things that had happened to us on the tour so far) had asked, &#8220;How do you spell &#8216;scabies&#8217;?&#8221; and Owen had replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s a cross between &#8216;scab&#8217; and &#8216;babies&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3015934/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>I began to wonder if there were any other professions in which a group of people spend 24 hours a day together for weeks or months at a time. Despite all the injuries, sicknesses and disasters of the tour, we had somehow managed to survive. My rumination and tendency to avoid confrontation had been difficult for my band mates to relate to and in turn I had felt a bit helpless up against their effortless directness. Our differences had been accentuated by the magnitude of our time together on tour. However, despite these differences, Hazel, Martha and I had become extremely close.</p>
<p>More than anything else we began looking forward to sleep. Sometimes we found ourselves sleeping in houses with overweight cats that weren&#8217;t allowed outside. If we stayed in a hotel we tried to wake up in time for the complimentary breakfast, which was usually very sugary. </p>
<p>After the show in Ottawa, Ontario, we had trouble finding somewhere with a vacancy. We finally found a motel with a vacancy but after we observed a man being handcuffed by police in the car park we decided to keep searching. Eventually we found an expensive hotel room with one bed. In the morning we ate the complimentary breakfast, which was very sugary. Then we got back in the car started driving again. The novelty of visiting a new city each day had subsided. During one of the shows Hazel thanked the audience for their attendance. &#8220;You&#8217;re a lovely audience. This is our first time in the US and we love it here.&#8221; Then someone yelled out, &#8220;The US?! Dude, you&#8217;re in Canada!&#8221;</p>
<p>Admittedly, I don&#8217;t have the clearest speaking voice. However, the following week, I was nonetheless taken off guard by the terseness of the Montreal police woman who was meant to be helping us fill in a police report. The window of our hire car had been smashed, our friend&#8217;s video camera and my backpack, which contained various personal belongings, had been stolen. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand you,&#8221; she interrupted as I was halfway through a question about the police report. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak French. Do you speak English?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t like that. &#8220;Of course I speak English, but you&#8217;re not speaking English. You&#8217;re just saying, &#8216;Blah nah nah, blah nah nah&#8217;. Speak clearly so I can understand you!&#8221; She seemed to take delight in impersonating me.</p>
<p>In Winooski, Vermont, we fell in love with the local band Hello Shark. Their songs had a certain playfulness and also a definite sadness about them. ?But I don&#8217;t like your friends/They&#8217;re not like you/And I don&#8217;t like your sister/She&#8217;s too New York/But I really like you mom/She talks like you/And I thought I&#8217;d never wanna go/Back to Massachusetts.&#8221; The next day we listened to their CD several times on the drive to Biddeford, Maine. Most of the houses we drove past had a pumpkin on the doorstep. Halloween was approaching. That night we played with Hello Shark again at a little bar called The Oak and the Ax. Someone had baked pumpkin and chocolate-chip cookies.</p>
<blockquote><p>?Despite all the injuries, sicknesses and disasters of the tour, we had somehow managed to survive.?</p></blockquote>
<p>The last show of the tour was at the Ridgewood Masonic Temple in Brooklyn, New York, with Dan Deacon and Lightning Bolt. We opened the night and in comparison to the other bands we must have sounded decidedly minimalist. From the merch table I had a good view of the last Casiotone performance I would ever see. Later, I ventured into the audience. Someone poured a beer down my back so I went back to the merch table. By this point there were about 700-800 people there. I stuffed toilet paper in my ears and found a safe spot on the mezzanine, which gave me a perfect view of Lightning Bolt and the anarchy that was about to unfold. </p>
<p>Instead of playing on the ground among the audience as they are known to do, Lightning Bolt played on the stage. Brian Chippendale hit his drums psycho-neurotically while screaming into the microphone that was attached to the inside of his mask. A <a href="/articles/3917459">circle pit</a> quickly formed, which created a gap between the moshers and non-moshers. As a result many crowd-surfers fell headfirst onto the wooden floor. Afterwards, I went outside for some fresh air. &#8220;Hey dude. Do you know where I could get some &#8216;yay&#8217;?&#8221; someone asked me. &#8220;No, sorry,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not from around here and I don&#8217;t know what that is anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> The Squirrels are braver in New York City. While standing in East River Park waiting for Kish, I walked right up to a one and it didn&#8217;t even freeze. It just looked up at me, with this ?what?? sort of expression, then went back to digging for nuts in the dirt around my feet.</p>
<p>New York is kind of like this in general, except for the nuts part. It is nice to settle here, after such a long tour and experience the sense of freedom that comes with feeling so small in such a hard ass city. People don&#8217;t apologise when they bump into you on the sidewalk, they look at you with the same expression as the squirrels and move on. It&#8217;s a pretty sad realisation to think, ?Wow, even the squirrel fits in better than I do.?</p>
<p>From Chicago, we proceeded to tick off towns on our long list. It felt easier after the break, although I had to sit up right at all times with a towel behind my back in an attempt to ease my back pain.</p>
<p>Vermont and Montreal are still battling it out as my favourite place for the second half of the tour.</p>
<p>In Burlington, I bought maple syrup in a jar shaped as an autumn leaf, the woman said it was the best you could get. Apparently they&#8217;re famous for it there, although I&#8217;m yet to try it. The drive from Burlington through New Hampshire was one of my favourites of the tour. I had my camera turned on and perched on my knee, snapping at the trees as they rushed past my window. I don&#8217;t think I lasted more than a minute the whole five-hour drive without clicking at the smudges of yellows, oranges, greens and reds that were tangled together in the foliage.</p>
<p>I know how lucky I am. People travel from all over the world to see the trees in the fall around that area, I was seeing it for the first time just by chance, with no knowledge of the area.</p>
<p>In Montreal, I got to speak French for the first time since I went on exchange as a teenager; although most people spoke English to me anyway which was disappointing. We played in a place that made sandwiches with veggie pates, sprouts, feta and hummus on pumpernickel bread.</p>

Kish and I went for a long walk in the cold before our set, and dropped into a grocery store where we stayed mostly in the cereal aisle staring at the Peanut Butter and French Toast Crunch. Kish bought some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and I held some granola for a while pretending it was mine.</p>
<p>The next morning, after poached eggs on muffins and antique store window shopping, we got a short message from Owen to meet him at the car. When we got there the front passenger window had been completely smashed in, and there were tiny even squares of it splayed all over the pavement. ?Nothing is missing,? Owen told us. The relief was short-lived, when we realised the video camera (along with the tour doco) and Kishore&#8217;s backpack had been stolen.</p>
<p>Hazel sat in the boot with her head in her hands, and I swore at the brick wall and scrunched up into a ball on the footpath. Stupid, but strangely satisfying and probably more appropriate than taking it out on someone who didn&#8217;t deserve it.</p>
<blockquote><p>?It&#8217;s strange how quickly our minds move on, shove things behind them and welcome the new as if the old never existed.?</p></blockquote>
<p>When Owen and Kishore went to find out about insurance, Haze and I gorged on Fairmount bagels with cream cheese, and counted our losses over the tour. I didn&#8217;t want to be defeated, but the list of losses was pretty long, in a lame sisterly moment we held hands and the squeezing kind of hurt. On the drive to Europ Car the icy wind came in strong through my window. I wrapped everyone&#8217;s jumpers around my neck and imagined I was in bed with a cup of chai, vegemite and avocado toast and a movie (a common daydream for me and Kish on this tour).</p>
<p>So the pros for each competing city:</p>
<p>? Vermont has maple syrup, a beautiful landscape, and people who won&#8217;t judge you on how much hot chocolate you drink.<br/>
? Montreal has bagels, sandwiches and the French.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know which one wins, but I&#8217;m conscious of the fact that regardless of all the shit that&#8217;s gone down on this tour, I&#8217;m still deliberating on what were the best parts, and which city wins. Everything else has quickly faded into the background or just added to the ridiculousness of an amazing trip.</p>
<p>Now that I am in New York and well rested, I can see all these long drives, the shows and the eats as such distant whisps and dreams. It&#8217;s strange how quickly our minds move on, shove things behind them and welcome the new as if the old never existed.</p>
<p>Today I spent a lot of money, ate frozen yogurt with granola from Pink Berry, and walked along the Brooklyn Bridge at night to see the city lights from the water. A looong tour has ended in a big city, and its nice to finally feel anonymous, and small. Even the squirrels are more savvy than me, and I kind of like that too.</p>
