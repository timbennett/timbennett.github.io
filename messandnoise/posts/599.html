                <h3>An interview conducted over MSN for a band that met and write songs over the internet. <strong>LAWSON FLETCHER</strong> gets meta with Marcus Whale and Travis Cook of Collarbones.
</h3>
<h2>&#8216;Skeletons All Over the Internet&#8217;</h2>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3019723/440x650-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
Given they met and continue to do most of their work there, it seems only fitting to seek out Marcus Whale and Travis Cook online. Because the internet is really where Collarbones was, is, and forever will be.</p>
<p>Travis and Marcus, who continue to live in the separate cities of Adelaide and Sydney, first met on a post-rock web forum in their mid-teens, bonding over a shared love of now somewhat passe genres that friends at school had never heard of. </p>
<p>As I chat with the pair over instant messaging, Marcus digs up some of their first posts to the forum for me. On the topic of, ?What makes post rock so powerful??, a young Travis had offered this pearl of wisdom:</p>
<div style="margin:0 0 15px 20px; color:#666;">
It&#8217;s powerful because it builds up.<br/>
I personally think the power to a song amplified [sic] in a build up.<br/>
Build ups make the climax more powerful.
</div>
<p>?Skeletons in the closet,? notes Marcus, wryly. ?Well, actually, skeletons all over the internet.?</p>
<p>Indeed, the pair have left evidence of their past and present in all manner of strange digital cul de sacs. Search hard enough and you can find some of the first tracks Travis made under his restless, often disturbing solo project Cyst Impaled, or a meticulously catalogued discography of Marcus? sublime vocal processing work as Scissor Lock. But it&#8217;s their central project as glitch-hop outfit Collarbones that is scattered most liberally across the net, not only by the band but many enthusiastic online fans. Marcus admits it was a ?chain of blogging? that led to their bouncy jam ?Beaman Park? appearing on <em>Pitchfork</em>?s influential <a href="http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14587-beaman-park/">?Forkcast?</a>. The pair themselves have constructed a digital mythos to match the music, made up of undelivered fan mail to male models, chopped and screwed R&amp;B cuts and Justin Bieber graffiti.</p>
<p>Yet the web is Collarbones? crucible as much as its closet. Marcus and Travis? friendship and collaboration blossomed and continues almost entirely online. Though they&#8217;d talked about starting a band together before, it was around 2007 when the spark for Collarbones was really lit, says Marcus, after Travis sent him a remix for Adelaide outfit Fire! Santa Rosa, Fire! he had made, that used reconstructed splices in the intro.</p>
<p>?I was already obsessed with cut-ups and the idea of taking a little syllable of music and recontextualising it. And knowing that Travis had made that, I wanted to exploit him.? This was the seed of the duo&#8217;s distinct aesthetic, in which the barely recognisable shards of other tracks are clipped, layered, looped and mangled into pixelated collages both soft and stuttering, over which Marcus croons poetic evocations of desire. It was first shown to the world on their 2009 EP <em><a href="/releases/2000342">Waiting For the Ghosts</a>*, whose title track is brilliantly composed of reconfigured samples from Bj&#8217;rk?s album *Vespertine</em>.</p>
<p>Though Marcus jokes about exploiting Travis, it&#8217;s actually fascinating just how democratic the pair&#8217;s working relationship is, and how deep and abiding their friendship. Travis even thanks Marcus for helping him commit to making music with more focus. ?Perfectionism is a fucking disease,? he says. ?I think the music I make is like a toxin I need to get out of my body. If I spend too much time on it, I&#8217;ll overanalyse it, which is only ever detrimental. But I think over the course of time I&#8217;ve become more focused, and I&#8217;m no longer just shitting out any old thang. Having Collarbones as a project means I have a reason to be more considered with musical decisions rather than not giving a shit, because there&#8217;s another person involved.? </p>
<p>In many ways, <em>Iconography</em> is a statement of this sense of purpose &#8211; released through Melbourne art collective Two Bright Lakes and funded in part by an Australia Council grant, this less ad hoc means of production and distribution is a sign of the pair staking a more serious claim to legitimacy.</p>
<p>But Marcus and Travis? influence on one another goes back much further than <em>Iconography</em>, and is so longstanding that the pair are in some odd symbiosis. Spending so much time chatting online, sending one another their own music and recommending others, Marcus says, has fused them together in a strange way, so that there is an echo of the other in each one&#8217;s taste and, it might be said, the way they make music.</p>
<p>?Before Collarbones, for a couple of years, we&#8217;d always send each other our solo tracks. Not many other people would hear them, so we used each other as a muse,? Travis explains.</p>
<p>Marcus: ?I wanted to release a 3? of Cyst Impaled at one point. I called it <em>Captain Cock: To the Rescue</em>. As a testament to my vanity, it included every track with anything to do with me.?</p>
<p>So the songs were literally written to each other?</p>
<p>?Not really,? says Travis. ?He sent me a file of himself singing ?Happy Birthday? to someone and I sampled it and made him sound stupid.?</p>
<p>?Oh yeah, great title,? recalls Marcus. ?Let me find it &#8230; ?Happy Birthday, I Hope You Like Choke On The Cake And Die, And Eat The Candles Too, Because They Burn Your Oesophagus Like Hell?. By The Supermega Blaxploitation &amp; Bondage Krew.?</p>
<p>The first time they met in person was for their first gig, long after they&#8217;d finished a good chunk of songs together online by sending tracks back and forth while chatting on MSN.</p>
<p>?I think it&#8217;s almost much of a muchness for us on face value because the internet is such a part of Travis? and my life. I remember one time I went to Adelaide to play a Scissor Lock show, so I had my laptop and we spent a significant amount of time, that trip, on our respective computers, occasionally chatting to each other about what was going on. That&#8217;s as close real life has gotten to MSN for me.?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this thinking, ?Here&#8217;s more evidence of how the internet destroys real human relationships?, you might want to think about how much time <em>you</em> actually spend here. More to the point, it&#8217;s a false separation anyway.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I think the music I make is like a toxin I need to get out of my body. If I spend too much time on it, I&#8217;ll overanalyse it, which is only ever detrimental?</p></blockquote>
<p>?The distinction between online and face-to-face communication is blurring even more and more,? Travis states. And if there was every evidence of how this can be a good thing, Collarbones are just that. Not only do the pair embrace the web as a place to make atmospheric, complex music, it seems encoded into the very stuff of their musical DNA. The duo have spent so much time on the internet that their music seems to have ingested its form in some odd way; a Vaseline-smeared reflection of the digital explosion in all its barbed and odd beauty. They have a singular knack for making beautiful little monuments out of the small snatches of otherwise transient moments and noises in the huge volume of music that criss-crosses the globe and our attention. Collarbones mine this world, rescuing from online oblivion the sounds they sense are intuitively valuable.</p>
<p>Travis explains this sampling practice in pathological terms: ?I think Collarbones to me is just the product of being exposed to a lot of things and feeling overwhelmed. It makes listening to too much music into something productive. I basically feel like I&#8217;m raping other people&#8217;s songs.?</p>
<p>Marcus, on the other hand, is more utilitarian in his description.</p>
<p>?I think part of it is a means to an end &#8211; we don&#8217;t use synths really, you can make a more interesting texture out of the tiny complexities in other audio?, he says. ?The focus, I suppose, is taking the grit and detail of existing textures and contextualising them differently. There&#8217;s not much appropriation of the groove, or allusion to the songs literally, or the harmony, like the source can often be, it can be shit, it can be amazing, it kind of doesn&#8217;t matter that much.?</p>
<p>They are both right, but only when you combine their insights can you really get a grasp of the aesthetic at play. Because Collarbones combine digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderphonics">plunderphonics</a> with something that is uniquely their own, smoothing over the cracks of their diverse sources by inducing a mesmeric, soulful ambience. In this way, the duo avoid simply repeating the fragmentation of digital life and instead make out of it something beautiful, sublime even. It&#8217;s an exquisite contradiction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s through this repurposing that Collarbones also engage in a more detailed exchange with the other crucial side to their identity: pop.</p>

<p/>
<h2>&#8216;Waiting for Bieber&#8217;s Ghost&#8217;</h2>
<p>Marcus and Travis are deeply engaged in pop, and in a way that is refreshingly un-ironic. ?We definitely think there is a lot of value in pop music, just as much as in experimental music,? Travis says. ?Everything is on equal ground.?</p>
<p>This duality is apparent on <em>Iconography*, which often seeks to achieve the clear hooks and inclusive sentiment of pop yet through experimental audio techniques. Mostly, though, it&#8217;s evident on *<a href="http://www.messandnoise.com/releases/2000819">Tiger Beats</a></em>, the EP of covers and remixes released earlier this year.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3019713/350x350-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
?<em>Iconography</em> is a pretty grim album, in some ways, and we definitely wanted to do covers,? says Marcus. ?I think it was originally going to be covers of teen pop anthems from the ages; thus ?Tiger Beats?.?</p>
<p>The result ended up a little more eclectic &#8211; renditions of Beach House&#8217;s ?Lover of Mine? and retired Melbourne act Psuche&#8217;s ?I Sea A Wolf? sit next to covers of Justin Bieber and Destiny&#8217;s Child, reflecting the pair&#8217;s seemingly limitless enthusiasm for their contemporaries, whether local or international, obscure or mainstream.</p>
<p>Covering pop songs has also helped develop Marcus? vocal performance: ?I have a lot more confidence with vocals, recording and singing live, that I didn&#8217;t even have a few months ago.? </p>
<p>What from? </p>
<p>?Just playing live more, getting drunk. But also listening to Justin Timberlake a lot, and Destiny&#8217;s Child, and wanting to kind of be them but knowing I can never really get there.?</p>
<p>Indeed, this act of imitating one&#8217;s idols is part of the deeper affinity between Collarbones and pop music, given that both are in some ways about desire and the ways we idolise people. ?The cult of celebrity is something we&#8217;re both interested in. It&#8217;s bizarre,? says Travis. The oblique references to the way we sanctify people, things and events on <em>Iconography* is far more concrete on *Tiger Beats</em>, raising this idolatry to the level of form.</p>
<p>?There were some fairly vague themes in the LP that were made incredibly obvious in <em>Tiger Beats</em>, like the way people form a lot of their own narratives from people they don&#8217;t even know and how they can do that,? explains Marcus. ?So I find the idea of linking music to celebrity really interesting, because these kind of naff songs can have a lot of power in the end.?</p>
<p>Rather than simply writing it off as flawed source material for jokey reappropriation, Collarbones absorb pop music, refill it, amplifying its amorphous emotions, its often painful, awkward beauty, and exploring the very intense relationships that we form with its makers, even as Marcus and Travis understand the spectral nature of this cathexis.</p>
<p>Their cover of ?One Time? showcases this complex engagement, which is ostensibly a cute take on a Justin Bieber hit, but one that&#8217;s actually quite genuine and uncontrived &#8211; and by the end coda, it&#8217;s magnified to the level of something ridiculously beautiful, transcendent even. </p>
<p>The way Marcus? rendered vocals, layered in an ascending choral rapture, are intercut with the clipped, stuttering beats of the song&#8217;s final moments lends what once seemed like a throwaway slice of teen-pop a haunting, deeply resonant quality. All of a sudden, the shadowy emotions and erotics of pop are bought to the surface, glistening resplendent in Collarbones? pixelated sunlight.</p>

<p/>
<p>?I really genuinely wanted to give all those covers a wholehearted go,? says Marcus, ?to meet the song halfway, otherwise you&#8217;re not doing it justice, whatever it is.? Travis agrees. ?There are too many ?ironic? covers of pop songs by bands and they only do it half-heartedly.?</p>
<p>?You have to believe in it,? says Marcus, ?and I think ?One Time? is something that&#8217;s pretty easy to believe in. Because it&#8217;s just a replication of this flimsy, but kind of beautiful continuum of what I think is just graduation from medieval courtly love. That shit doesn&#8217;t really change you know. Even if J-Biebz didn&#8217;t write those verses with all of his heart and soul over a poetry book that night, just think of the millions of people for whom that song might consume their lives. That audience really constructs their own, very real narrative.?</p>
<p>So is Marcus a Belieber, then? </p>
<p>?Haha, not at all, he&#8217;s a ghost.?</p>
<h2>&#8216;Don Juan&#8217;</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m watching the ?Don Juan? clip while we chat online, and I can&#8217;t help thinking about how well the video and the song encapsulate Collarbones. Fabricated out of esoteric found footage, mainly a US navy demonstration reel and haunting medical films, it&#8217;s strangely entrancing, hinting at a more poignant order of things beneath its playful surface. The wonderfully quaint images of sailors at work and play also brings to the surface the soft erotics of the music. </p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>?I thought about the lyrics and I think the sailor footage was pretty relevant,? says Marcus. ?The song is about the Adonises you fall in love with and the power they have and abuse. It&#8217;s also about the whole song and dance and posturing that governs our biology.?</p>
<p>This bodily focus brings Collarbones full circle in a way, for it was Travis? early fascination with clavicles that resulted in their name. It&#8217;s always the first bone you hear of breaking &#8211; ?and you can&#8217;t fix it,? says Travis. Fragile, erotic, but in an odd, hard way; it&#8217;s entirely apt. ?Yeah, and ?collarbones? as a word is similar to ?collaboration?,? says Travis. Fusing, joining, despite the fractures.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also something about the historical grain of the pockmarked, black- and-white film that Travis used in assembling the video. ?I wanted to find images that were evocative. I think there&#8217;s a funny contrast between what the song sounds like and the era of most of the footage. It almost seems to me like the man wearing the virtual reality headset in the first sequence is looking into the past.? </p>
<p>This retro-futuristic vision isn&#8217;t really a contrast though, so much as a paradoxical fit. The images, like Collarbones? sound, don&#8217;t so much come from a past world as an alternate world. I try to explain to the pair how their music evokes this kind of timeless space by calling their work mature, but Travis calls me out: ?What is ?maturity?? When I think of mature musicians, I think of ?adult contemporary?.?</p>
<p>Given their playfulness and vitality, perhaps ?mature? isn&#8217;t quite the right word to describe Collarbones, but even as they gleefully detourne the ephemeral fragments of the digital and the popular into something transcendent, there&#8217;s a glimpse of an insight far beyond their youth. ?I suppose part of it is not necessarily finding, but looking for an individual voice,? says Marcus. ?A band is probably mature if they&#8217;re able to sound like they&#8217;re not necessarily of a time, or a place, or of another band.? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s even more remarkable that Collarbones are beginning to achieve this when they are formed out of the most contemporary and ubiquitous of music and media.</p>
