                <h3>Berlin-based Australian synth-popper <strong>JOSHUA TEICHER</strong> records and performs as Mez Medallion. He stripped his band down to a solo concern for a festival in Iceland, with surprising results.

<p>This may just look like ancient rocks and moss but these ancient rocks and moss do something for my soul.</p>
<p>Some of this will perhaps appear as though I&#8217;m being sponsored by some Icelandic tourism agency, but I&#8217;m not. I just love the place and you could almost just shut your eyes and take a photo and capture something beautiful. Although it does make me think whether you would see beauty or sameness if you grew up there.</p>

<p>The first weekend we were in a small town outside of Reykjavik called Eyrarbakki, which has about 500 inhabitants. Like most places in Iceland, it is on the coast. There was a music festival [Melodica] going on there organised by our friends J&#8217;n and Uni. They have a beautiful house overlooking the water and their back living room has a stage built into it and the sun sets behind you as you play. We played in there on the Friday night and then on Sunday afternoon we played in the town church &#8211; but there were shows set up all over town.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036658/480x540-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>We then headed back to Reykjavik and had a couple of days off. It&#8217;s a really magical place; everyone is so generous and hospitable. The people we stayed with we now call our ?Icelandic family?; everyone is generally so helpful and want to get involved in ensuring you have a nice time there.</p>
<p>One day we walked through the mountains for an hour to a hot river, heated by the earth&#8217;s core. It was bliss. At least 42 degrees in the water, I think, and outside must have been no more than 10. The higher up the river and mountain you go the hotter the water is, so you choose your temperature.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036659/640x450-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The next few days we had a couple of warm-up gigs in preparation for the festival. First up was a showcase at <a href="http://www.12tonar.is/about-12tonar.php">12 Tonar Records</a>, a famous grassroots record store in Reykjavik, perhaps akin to <a href="/search/?q=pure+pop">Pure Pop Records</a> in Melbourne.</p>
<p>That evening we then played a night organised by Pete entitled ?Melancholica? &#8211; a night dedicated to sad songs. The brief was to play one sad song of our own and one favourite sad song by another band. For my cover I stripped back my techno/house version of [Destiny&#8217;s Child&#8217;s] ?Say My Name? and tried to create something with my hands that was simple and expressive &#8211; two notes on a loop that is common to all the chords &#8211; and just went for it&#8230;</p>

<p/>
<p>The night got a nice write-up in the local English publication <em><a href="http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Happiness-Is-A-Sad-Song">Reykjavik Grapevine</a></em> &#8211; my performance was a highlight of the evening, with its ?dejected interpretation? and ?despondent vocals.? We joked that they are quotes that should go on every gig poster, bio and press kit from now on. </p>

<p>The last weekend was the Melodica Festival. Organised by Pete Uhlenbruch (a.k.a. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/owlsoftheswamp">Owls of the Swamp</a>), Melodica Festival started in Melbourne. Unlike the usual assumption based on the title, it is not a celebration of the instrument melodica but a music festival that draws on a community spirit &#8211; a bringing together of friends and artists that might be on tour nearby. Pete has travelled quite a bit and the idea has spread to likeminded friends and prior Melodica participants, with the festival now happening in Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, NYC, Aarhus and more. Along with some other people, the Reykjavik Melodica is also run by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/svavarknutur">Svavar Kn&#8217;tur</a>, a beautiful Icelandic folksinger. Check him out if you can.</p>
<p>The thing I loved about Melodica is that it is more like all the best bits of your first school camp (excitement of hanging out with new people, you have to spend a lot of time with people, etc.), a music workshop and just the thrill of playing music in a different country.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3036661/640x640-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p>The festival ran for three days over three venues and 70 artists. Being a guest artist in other people&#8217;s sets is encouraged and is also a great thing to do because you might be hanging out for 16 hours between the first set, the last set and then the amount of drinking that may follow. You collaborate and you get to see people play two to four times throughout the whole week; you watch them grow and warm up. I learnt a lot about other musicians? playing [and] performance style and took note of the things I liked and didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>I had a bunch of various gear and loop pedal intentions, which didn&#8217;t go so well in the first show we did in Eyrarbakki, so I decided to simplify by stripping back the ideas. In some cases I went completely acoustic (or at least just the electric guitar) and this made way for bringing in other vocalists or getting the audience to provide foot-stomps and claps in place of drum machines. Or I pared back the loops and just kept it really spare, clear, punchy and more manageable. On one song I used an app on my phone to program some minimal drum loops along with some synth parts I could play in. I come from playing and composing my music on the computer and normally performing it with a band, so it was a great experience to just embrace change and spontaneity within a structured context.</p>
<p>One example is that on the last day, my sixth show, I was scheduled to play in the Vikin Maritime Museum. I had all my pedals and drum pads ready but it was feeling a bit dark inside and for one brief moment the skies cleared, so we jumped out into the fleeting sunshine and did the set totally acoustically. I had an absolutely all-star choir backing me for one of my songs, ?Move Towards the Light?, originally a layered dreamy synth-pop track.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43645896&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>The impromptu choir included <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/LucyHall">Lucy Hall</a> (an artist from Sydney who I&#8217;d never met before with a beautiful soulful voice that just soars and soars over the most beautiful tunes and really solid rhythm from a ukulele), Honig (Germany), Bernhard Eder (Austria), Taylor Selsback (US), Maria Homme (Norway), <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/listentophia">Phia</a> (whose single I am producing and we&#8217;re <a href="http://mezmedallion.tumblr.com/post/60437391243/im-going-on-a-12-date-tour-of-germany">touring Germany</a> together next month) and Cavanagh &amp; Argus (awesome brother duo of fingerpicking and vocal harmonies from Melbourne).</p>
<p>Someone got it on their phone; I think it really sums up my whole experience in Iceland.</p>
