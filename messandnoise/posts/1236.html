                <h3>Newcastle collective Firekites are about to release ?Closing Forever Sky?, their first album since 2008?s debut ?The Bowery?. Mixed in Chicago by John McEntire (Tortoise, Stereolab), it&#8217;s steeped in pedals, synths and dozens of layers at a time, explains leader <strong>TIM McPHEE</strong>.

<h2>?Closing Forever Sky?  </h2>
<p>This track was a blast to produce. Like so many of the songs, it was seeded during one of our many epic live jams, then meticulously referenced and re-recorded. It was the last track we put down for the record and I think it really shows in the production. It actually lived as an instrumental for almost a year before the lyrics and melody revealed themselves. I thought it was always going to be instrumental. The chorus vocal was written and recorded just a day or so before I flew out to Chicago for the mix. I can&#8217;t imagine the track without the vocals now.</p>
<p>Peg [Adams]?s Rhodes lines on this track get me every time &#8211; the girl knows how to find the truth on the keys. This whole track really was a treat to stitch together. It was during this session that I discovered the possibilities and clarity of tracking guitars DI [direct input] through my pedalboard. It really was a game-changer. The Moog line pretty much wrote itself: I patched it in, the tone was there, it unfolded first take. The [Minimoog] Model D is just one of those instruments that feels like it has its own stories to tell, its own personality. Of all the album tracks, John [McEntire] spent the least time mixing ?Closing Forever Sky?. Despite its length and its 60+ channels, I think he absolutely nailed it &#8211; in three hours tops.</p>

<h2>?Fallen?  </h2>
<p>Conceived <em><a href="/releases/2000057">Bowery</a></em>-era, the acoustic intro was written during soundcheck before our album launch in Newcastle. Now that&#8217;s some time ago! It has since gone through many stages of evolution but didn&#8217;t really feel complete until Jason laid his strings down. It amazes me the way strings can completely transform the essence and momentum of a track. It&#8217;s definitely a Part A Part B kind of arrangement.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146053620%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-gLxGv&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?The Counting?  </h2>
<p>OK, so this was an extremely challenging track to realise &#8211; more so, hard to tame. The sheer amount of channels, the length, the layers, the arrangement. It was the first song post-<em>Bowery* we were all really excited about. We&#8217;d written loads of new tracks, but this felt very real and relative to where we were heading musically. It&#8217;s influenced by *Dirty*-era Sonic Youth for sure, but mostly by the new guitars and pedal boards we had patched up. Post-*Bowery</em> we found ourselves on a massive pedal binge &#8211; a search for new tones and sounds and colour. This pushed us back onto electric guitars more and more and lead us to many epic long and loud jams. Lyrically you could possibly pin it as a love song. Peg&#8217;s harmonies are like feathers drifting in the wind.</p>
<p>Being essentially a recording project &#8211; for me, jamming this track was also the first time Firekites felt like a ?band?. Whilst it was the first song recorded for the album, it was definitely the last one finished. The mix ended up being quite the monster &#8211; again, just so many channels to consider. We got snagged during the mix revisions &#8211; recalling the settings on John&#8217;s Trident A-range console (mixing desk) proved to be quite the task. Being a vintage analogue classic, it can sometimes drift and can take hours to warm up.</p>
<p>We got there in the end but it nearly broke the both of us. Very glad we got it finished!</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Fifty Secrets?  </h2>
<p>This track almost went to mix with only acoustics and vocals. Just a couple of weeks out I heard a beat in my head whilst walking by the cliff at Bar Beach. I literally ran home, fired up <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/maschine/production-systems/maschine/">Maschine</a> and put the beats down in the best part of an hour &#8211; this is really quick for me. The bass then found its way later that night &#8211; by morning it was complete. The acoustic arrangement, however, had been laboured over at length &#8211; we wanted to capture the two acoustic parts live and in one pass. We spent AGES on this! Was totally worth it in the end &#8211; they really stitch together like a web woven with string.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Somewhere Bright First?  </h2>
<p>Testing line levels, I hit record as Pegs was warming up on the piano. (She was not aware of such things but her first take was perfect! It was that simple.) Her piano line inspired the vocal melody, which then shaped the bass. Ben <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>For</em>Carnation_(album">Howe]?s drums on the intro are probably my favourite beats on the record &#8211; so honest and spirited. The phrasing of the vocal has most certainly been coloured by years of obsessing over The For Carnation. Their [self-titled 2000 offering</a>) on Touch &amp; Go has been a major influence. Brian McMahan &#8211; genius.</p>
<p>Part B of this track found its voice once Jason <a href="http://www.moogmusic.com/products/moogerfoogers/mf-108m-cluster-flux">Tampake] put down his violin &#8211; again live and improvised, his drones and surges were then re-amped and fucked with through the [Cluster Flux</a>. These noises and Space Echo swells ended up being peppered about the intro too. So many of these tracks were layered over multiple sessions then peeled back again and again. It&#8217;s sometimes really hard to stop when overdubbing &#8211; it&#8217;s just so much fun! I think we found the place in the end.</p>

<p/>
<h2>?Said Without a Sound?  </h2>
<p>A long-lost live-room take that was rediscovered literally two years later. We tried re-tracking it with full production but the original take just had the energy. The soul. Adam [Jesson] then added bass to it and a real <em>Twin Peaks</em> kind of vibe. This song speaks truths on the sadness and demise of a friendship that was crumbling at the time. An important piece in the story of this record.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146063078%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-9nH4Y&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<h2>?Antidote&#8217;</h2>
<p>Lyrically, ?Antidote? is essentially about people who use substance abuse as the excuse for their dishonest and cowardly behaviour. Life&#8217;s too short for such things, for such people.</p>
<p>I pulled an all-nighter the eve before the mix in Chicago to finish the guitar arrangement. I&#8217;d tracked a bunch of different guitar parts for the outro just before I flew out, but hadn&#8217;t stitched them up yet. The tones remind me of The Cure <em>Show</em> live album, which I love. It was on this VHS back in ?93 that I first saw Robert Smith play a Fender Bass VI; I knew at that moment I had to own one. Eight years later, in Byron Bay I found a re-sprayed ?64 Olympic White in a local music store. I damn near fell over at the very the sight of it. They&#8217;d had it for years and wanted to move it on, and at the right price. I got real lucky with that one. Without a doubt my favourite guitar to this day.</p>

            <p>Mess + Noise was an Australian music news website and discussion forum. It was taken over by Junkee Media and later shut down. This is a partial archive.</p>
            <p>(Question marks instead of quotation marks? [Markdown links](<a href="http://commonmark.org/">http://commonmark.org/</a>) in text? At the time of scraping, the remnants of the M+N website weren't properly rendering the CMS contents to HTML.)</p>
