<h2>?Disco Connect?</h2>
<p>Jai: I think we&#8217;ve been afraid of funk before and it has negative connotations because everyone was name checking Television and avoiding James Brown like the plague, but we aren&#8217;t afraid.</p>
<p>Ivan: I think a lot of bands just take themselves too seriously, and they don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s OK to have fun. We&#8217;re not a bunch of downers so why pretend? So we just thought we&#8217;re going to make an R&amp;B slow jam because we bloody well feel like it, and we&#8217;re going to make it the first song on the record just to prove we can. Disco Connect was also one of the only surviving sessions of us trying to record in a studio, but then again it&#8217;s a little moot as I sound replaced the drums, and re amped everything anyways.</p>
<p>Xav: I enjoyed putting this song together. After all, I only had to play three notes throughout the entire song. After writing predominantly rock music, it was good to re-visit our inner-white boy funk.</p>

<h2>?Taller Than You Then?</h2>
<p>Jai: This song is about dealing with the death of a friend. I just felt like I wasn&#8217;t sad enough and I remembered all these things about him and I was more worried for his family than anything. Because when you die, you&#8217;re alright (unless you believe in reincarnation or hell, but we&#8217;ll save the theology for somewhere else besides <em>M+N</em>) but your family has to go through all the shit and the grief and the mourning. I think it&#8217;s more of a celebration, plus I&#8217;d much rather us do a song that&#8217;s massive and upbeat and fun rather than some sad sap ballad.</p>
<p>Ivan: ?Taller Than You? Then came about in an odd fashion, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be an album track and I remember the demo being pretty bad, I heard the lyrics and knew what it was about, I felt compelled to complete this song; a homage to someone who all our friends really admired who they&#8217;d lost so suddenly. We just used the demo as a template for the basis of the track. The two most interesting things about this track are: the guitar was recorded as an improv (Jai hasn&#8217;t been able to replicate what he did on here live); and the drums were recorded with a broken vocal mic and a really cheap large diaphragm microphone, straight into Pro Tools. It&#8217;s a myth that you need expensive equipment to get a good sound &#8211; it&#8217;s how you use the tools you have at hand.</p>
<p>Xav: The man of whom this song is about, had a charming, friendly smile that was enough to leave you feeling a friend, if not a flirt! He was tall, and had a very flamboyant style. I still see his family from time to time passing through my work, and there is an underlying sense that they&#8217;ve lost someone special.</p>

<h2>?Dozens?</h2>
<p>Jai: I poached the line from this book I was reading, and it just sounded nice. I feel like it&#8217;s a bit of a silly line rhyming it with &#8220;and cheese and it&#8217;s smell is always wrapped in muslin&#8221; I mean, what kind of a rock band talks about a type of cotton. But it is about sensations and smell and being away from a loved one. I wrote the bare bones of it when I was in New York. I was staying in Queens in a neighbourhood that used to be populated mainly by Latin Americans and later had a massive wave of immigration from India and Pakistan, so it&#8217;s really vibrant and smells amazing like spice and food. I think that&#8217;s where those lines about ?smell? and the &#8220;colour of the wine&#8221; come from. The vocal and a lot of the loops were recorded with the mic in my computer.</p>
<p>Ivan: This is the only song without live drums on it. When we were building the track Jai asked if I wanted to play some, but I thought we didn&#8217;t need it. Instead I augmented Jai&#8217;s acoustic with some synths, I played a screaming guitar line (coming in at the end) and some more synths. One of the main sonic ideas behind the whole album, <em>In Loving Memory</em> was to marry electronic and acoustic elements together. I think for the most part it worked. </p>

<h2>?Lung Sum?</h2>
<p>Jai: ?Lung Sum? has confused people a bit, some people think the title is Chinese or something. But it&#8217;s just a bad play on words. It was originally titled ?Lungs Have Sung?. But it does sum up the song in a way, because it touches on breathing and drowning as a metaphor, and is about a fallout from a friendship.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/H5EqYCBq0E4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p>Ivan: This was the first single off the album, with the film clip with all the dust, the original drum recordings were from a rehearsal room recording that didn&#8217;t sound the best, so after some convincing from a few people we admitted defeat and re-recorded them in a studio. I did a lot of the pre mixes for the album so the mix engineer, Tom McFall, could just sink his teeth into the recordings, but with this one he ended up making the kit sound garage-y and messed up, and I think the initial sound we were going for was retained although a little cleaner. We also added a wonky synth line in the chorus to soften the blow of the screaming guitars. The single version of this song is a totally different mix. It doesn&#8217;t contain the synth, and sounds rather muscular and strange.</p>

<h2>?Over There?</h2>
<p>Jai: Is very simply about being away. It was written at the same time as ?Dozens?, and the lyrics are kind of reductive, trying to put something into its simplest form. The music also follows this path. We tinkered with this song for so long, but we wanted to keep the progression the same the whole time, and it&#8217;s a real skill to try to use a loop and the same chord, it&#8217;s all in the dynamic and the arrangement of the layers. I remember the first time we played it live the audience went completely quiet, and I think we knew that it was too much of a wall and it needed to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Ivan: In the development of this song, Jai really wanted to add more lyrics, and I just thought that was stupid: the song structure is basically a really well-refined two-bar loop. The way it starts is actually on the second meter of the first bar, which makes the whole thing off kilter in a way. And the words just seemed like a call to arms, so I just told him not to bother, and because it took so long to learn the musical phrasing of this song (which is all syncopated anyhow) there would be no way he would have been able to remember anything else. We wanted it to still have a groove, but have an odd feel about it. Playing the song live really confused the audience until we got that nutted out.</p>
<p>Xav: Despite this song basically being a loop, it marks a very important event in The Paper Scissors&#8217; history. This song was the first we played together in rehearsals as a three-piece. It went from being a sweet-sounding love song to an outburst of anger, frustration and a sunken heart, similar to the feeling that your lover just cheated on you &#8211; but not quite that harsh. We pointed our amps at each other, positioned the drum kit close to the centre of the room, and unleashed our distortion pedals. Far from what the song was attempting to be.</p>

<h2>?On Your Hand?</h2>
<p>Jai: This one is kinda like The Ramones being produced by Phil Spector, it&#8217;s so fast and rushed but there are all these intricate little vocal bits and layers and huge reverbs. It has a bit of an African vibe to the drums, which we were wary of as every Tom, Dick and Harry have been doing this in Aussie indie bands, but we tried to make it more badass and loud and messed up. Lyrically, the words are about meeting someone new and the excitement of that and falling in love. In the line, &#8220;All flooded and keen with Dopamine and words I can&#8217;t pronounce&#8221;, the word is ?norepinephrine?, which is one of the chemicals that are released when you fall in love. I read some article on the neurology behind love and I was trying to be a smarty.</p>
<p>Ivan: ?On Your Hand? was a song that we nearly dropped from the album, mainly because of the ?back to Africa? vibe of the song, but we changed it up a bit by making Xavier&#8217;s bass really aggressive and distorted. I think his bass playing really makes this song. Its melody is so strong, and really carries the weight of the song on its shoulders figuratively speaking. The track came together in the end &#8211; even with our initial reservations.</p>

<h2>?Soft Pig?</h2>
<p>Jai: This was one song that made it from a session we did at Electric Avenue that has since closed down sadly. I don&#8217;t want to say too much, but I think it&#8217;s surprising this song. It could be a folk song but we turned it out into something much more complex and big. It&#8217;s about my grandfather, who was a policeman, and from there it kind of skirts around family and mortality. I wrote the words after I visited my granddad one day, he used to be this hulking presence that would have scared the shit out of criminals and his children, but like what happens to all of us, he has shrank and gotten frail. But wit that he has softened up into this very tender and beautiful man who relishes his family and wants to tell us stories and jokes all the time.</p>
<p>Ivan: This song is basically my take on a southern crunk-type beat with skittering hi-hats and a really tight snare, and due to the song being in 6/8 I could flex my cross-time drum skills. I come from a jazz background, and haven&#8217;t really had a chance to explore permutations on the kit since I joined my old band, Belles Will Ring. Although I really enjoyed being a founding member of BWR, I just knew I had to concentrate on something which was more of a challenge. Paper Scissors, I suppose, offered me that challenge. I like the way the song is able to keep a tension augmented by a descending acoustic and a simple but really distorted bass line. I think this is another highlight of Xavier&#8217;s playing. He tends to be the rock of the band.</p>

<h2>?Mechanism (Thick Mortar)&#8217;</h2>
<p>Jai: We tried this a bunch of times. It was really fast and grungy, like a poor mans Pixies of something, but surfy. We felt like it was a good song but just wasn&#8217;t the right arrangement. So we stripped it back and changed it heaps, slowed it down and focused on the melody more and the groove. I think we could have a whole disc of versions of these songs; we&#8217;ve done some four times. This one is also about friendship and death, more fun!</p>
<p>Ivan: This song has drum recordings from three different sessions, I think, and I am playing over loops of myself playing. Initially it was really fast and punky, but it sounded shit. It didn&#8217;t fit with the rest of the album at all when the whole thing was taking shape, so Jai and I argued in the end about changing it. I won in the end, but after we had recorded the song, and it was partially mixed, I wanted to drop it from the album completely! I lost that vote, but I&#8217;m OK with how it is now.</p>

<h2>?Wrong?</h2>
<p>Jai: This was written at the same time as ?Lung Sum?. It was demoed on this awful Casio that was missing keys and had the notes written on the ones that were still there. Ivan stripped the music from it and added the vocal to a completely new track which was typically moody and abrasive. We came back to that version at the end and added drums because the version we recorded ?properly? got way too bombastic and ?rock?. I&#8217;m still not sure what the lyrics are about, I think it was started by seeing someone reading some crap paper on the train and just thinking that we believe bullshit a lot of the time, and then it morphed into a song about the dirtiness of ambition.</p>
<p>Ivan: We recorded this song about three times, and we failed twice, and I think the reason was because the demo was so good after I had torn the shit out of it and added some more instrumentation, that we just couldn&#8217;t get it right. So we just took out the programmed drums of the drums, borrowed some gear from Berkfinger [Philadelphia Grand Jury] to record some new drums. I got totally sick of just shoving some mics into Pro Tools and wanted some extra colour, so it was nice being trusted with basically his whole studio to record some stuff, it really helped.</p>

<h2>?Turn It To Gold?</h2>
<p>Jai: I think the lyrics on this are very plain. I have tried to hide the meaning of songs a lot before and be really obtuse, but this one is about as far from that as possible. It really is about the things that are important in life and not shying away from them. I love the outro. I secretly hope that someone will rap over it one day (see below). The drums have that nice dirty hip-hop, loop vibe and the synth that Ivan put over it is really ugly and shrill but has such a lovely melodic line.</p>
<p>Ivan: ?Turn It To Gold? is another song that we recorded at least three times. This version is another one from the same session as ?We&#8217;ve Been Wrong?. With the majority of the recordings on the album, we just recorded it in Jai&#8217;s second bedroom/studio/creative space. It&#8217;s a small room and really only just fits a drum kit and long table. We managed to fit three people in there, but in summer it&#8217;s the worst! The synth at the end is some crazy plug-in, which I was given a free licence for. It&#8217;s worth about 30k and is used in film studios. It&#8217;s basically a horn orchestra emulator, and the reason why it sounds weird is due to the fact that originally, ?Turn It To Gold? was faster and I nabbed it from the second attempt of this song. I then slowed the sucker down. I have since stolen the last bit, and my rapper friend, Herb, who I produce beats for will be using it on his next mix tape. Ha!</p>

<h2>?Drunk Swim?</h2>
<p>Jai: This was the last song written for the album. We discussed it and the album was already being mixed in London, but we decided to record it anyway. It felt like we had to make the decision whether it was the first song on something else or the last song on this album. I&#8217;m glad it made it. It sums up the album nicely, it&#8217;s kind of an index to all the themes on the album, and is a celebration of life, death, friends and love.</p>
<p>Ivan: ?Drunk Swim? is my favourite song on the album, possibly because it didn&#8217;t take any effort. Initially we had another song penned for the album, but I was convinced it was the weakest link, and Jai had recently shown me a demo of a new song he was keeping for the next thing we were going to do. I&#8217;m glad this one made it, and we did some interesting things with the recording. The guitars were played through a ghetto blaster (that had a black and white TV in middle) as an amp. It sounded so plunky and awesome, and that is the foundation of the middle part of the song when I went crazy and added epic synths. There are also triple-tracked drums on this song. I sampled my drums from ?Lung Sum?; re-programmed them; recorded live drums over the top; and then replaced the programmed sequence with drum machine samples to add some beef.</p>
