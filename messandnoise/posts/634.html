<strong>What&#8217;s the idea behind Overground?</strong><br/>
There are a bunch of overlapping ideas behind Overground. Central for the artists are the ideas of experimentation, risk, improvisation, intervention and collaboration. Artists can interpret those things however they want and respond really freely. We&#8217;ve chosen artists who already embody those qualities and thrown them into a big ambitious experimental context. For the audience, Overground is a sensory overload of action, noise, movement and stimulation, sitting somewhere between a festival, a happening, a carnival and a party. We want overground to be extraordinary and celebratory.</p>
<p><strong>Is the event about busting open preconceived ideas of ?noise? and ?jazz??</strong><br/>
I think that creative artists have been busting open those categories since the beginning, and have always been playful with ?preconceived? idioms. [Co-curators] Sophie [Brous], Lloyd [Honeybrook] and I all make music that moves around those categories very freely so it&#8217;s natural for us think about musicians in more specific, personal and idiosyncratic ways, rather than bundling them into big generalised categories like jazz or noise. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve tried to stage collaborations that connect the dots between different traditions and approaches. There&#8217;s a spectrum of ways in which artists can work together ranging from easy consensus through to extreme juxtaposition. It&#8217;s all good!</p>
<p><strong>Is this your first year as co-curator?</strong><br/>
Yeah, Lloyd Honeybrook and I have come on board with Sophie Brous as co-curators this year, taking the place of Sean Baxter and Annalee Koernig, who did an amazing job last year. Last year I performed in collaboration with film artist Dirk De Bruyn and had an incredible time, and wanted to be involved again. The 2010 event was a revelation so we have a lot to live up to.</p>
<p><strong>Are you participating this year as a performer?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m performing as part of Sky Needle. We&#8217;re a quartet from Brisbane making a kind of primitive junk/punk sound using simple homemade instruments made of wood, plastic and latex. We&#8217;ll be collaborating with Snawklor, which is a real privilege. There&#8217;s a link in the shared use of recycled and homemade devices, but I guess we have more of a rock thunk to us. It should be interesting. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>How are the collaborations decided?</strong><br/>
Sophie, Lloyd and I just threw ideas around until they sat right. There are a whole bunch of different strategies for curating an event like this, but mostly it comes down to intuition. Does it feel right? We wanted to challenge all the artists involved, but also to be sensitive to everyone&#8217;s different approaches and make sure that the collaborations emphasise rather than subsume the unique qualities of each performer. Some artists, more from the improv world, are totally comfortable in one-off musical encounters, whereas other artists require more time, preparation and consideration, so we took that into account. We also wanted collaborations that connect artists of different nationalities, backgrounds and generations where possible so that we can generate valuable experiences and encounters for the artists.</p>
<p><strong>Is it all largely improvised?</strong><br/>
You&#8217;d have to ask the artists. I think improvisation is a key thread throughout all of this, but it&#8217;s not a prerequisite or an idiom that we&#8217;re asking artists to subscribe to. Everyone involved is free to approach the work in the way that suits them. I personally do a lot of preparation around the sounds and setup I&#8217;m going to use, but I try to let the form and content of the performance evolve in real time. However, it should be said that there are a number of exceptionally brilliant improvisers involved in Overground, who are capable of coming up with mind-blowing music totally spontaneously in any situation. Improvised music of really high quality is inspirational in a way that is different from other music.  </p>
<p><strong>Do most of the performances happen simultaneously?</strong><br/>
There are performances spread throughout the day in a few different spaces, with some overlap but also a fair bit of space. We expect the audience to move about really actively checking out different acts and spaces without being constricted necessarily by having to see sets from start to finish. The simultaneity is exciting because it activates the audience too. They navigate the event, and everyone has a unique experience.</p>
<p><strong>Explain what you mean by ?roamers and installation artists?.</strong><br/>
These artists exist outside of the scheduled formal program and deal directly with the audience in the spaces inhabited by the audience, ie. hallways, stairwells and everywhere else. We&#8217;ve asked them to be mobile, flexible, interventionist and interactive. They might perform for one person for 10 seconds and then move on to someone else. The roamers open up different possibilities for redefining the audience-performer relationship in really responsive and unpredictable ways. The concept follows the model of a ?happening? rather than a concert. There&#8217;s also some installation artists who work in sculptural or site-specific ways, like Keptis (kinetic sculpture), Radio Cegeste (radio broadcasts), and Public Assembly (dialogue) and we felt they would add another layer to the richness of the overall event.</p>
<p><strong>Are you utilising spaces within the Melbourne Town Hall that your average punter wouldn&#8217;t know about? Any in particular?</strong><br/>
The Yarra Room upstairs is a lovely ornate space that will make the average punter feel very special. Really, the whole building is like that. Our roamers have a kind of psycho-geographic mission to explore and articulate different spaces in the building, so follow a roamer. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s the loudest band on the bill?</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s a lot of loud stuff this year, and we&#8217;re setting up a quadraphonic PA system in the lower town hall stage to cater for the most ?sonic? groups. I think the ZOND/Fusinato/Tammens group is going to be insanely heavy. Also the Will Guthrie/Cured Pink duo explores some pretty extreme percussive material. Charlemagne Palestine&#8217;s electronics solo could get off the hook, as could Faust/Noetinger/Baxter. Just writing all those names is making me excited.</p>
<p><strong>What collaborations are you most looking forward to?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m excited about everything. There are some really special ones though. Jim Denley/XnobbqX is a standout for me in that it brings together such a respected and important figure in free improvisation and sound art with a scuzz duo that have so systematically deconstructed the rock format. The practices totally overlap but come together from different directions. The Will Guthrie/Cured Pink duet also has that weirdness about it, with sound art, improv, noise and psychical performance tactics all smashing together. Oren Ambarchi/Charlemagne Palestine and Chris Abrahams/Tony Conrad are obviously incredible sets that have generated massive anticipation. I think its fantastic to have two hugely significant Australian artists collaborating with two absolute heroes of the avant-garde tradition.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the must-see set of the afternoon?</strong><br/>
Rully Shabara and Wukir Suryadi are amazing. They&#8217;re a duo from Yogyakarta, Indonesia who combine Javanese folk influences with noise, punk and freeform improvisation. Wukir builds his own instruments out of bamboo and they sound like an electric guitar and drum machine in one. Rully screams, shouts and sings in a totally compelling and unique way. I&#8217;m really proud to have these guys playing at Overground and representing the Yogya scene which is pretty unknown in Australia but is totally awesome.</p>
<blockquote><p>?I think improvisation is a key thread throughout all of this, but it&#8217;s not a prerequisite or an idiom that we&#8217;re asking artists to subscribe to.?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a heavy international component this year. Who are you particularly excited about?</strong><br/>
All the internationals bring special qualities to this event. There&#8217;s a strong NYC component this year, which reflects Sophie&#8217;s deep engagement and respect for the jazz and new music scene over there. Tim Berne, Matt Mitchell, Oscar Noriega and Mary Halvorson, among others, represent a cutting edge showcase of artists from the world&#8217;s vanguard jazz city. There&#8217;s a bunch of Australian artists like Clayton Thomas, Will Guthrie, Tim O&#8217;Dwyer and Darren Moore, who are based internationally and have grown massively as musicians in recent years. It&#8217;s really exciting to welcome them back here. Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins) is an absolute hero of free noise and improv drumming, so hosting him is unbelievable. And then Tony Conrad, Charlemagne and Faust are all canonical figures in the history of experimental music. The whole thing is beyond exciting. </p>
<p><strong>Some of the performers work in a pop/rock context. Are they excited about stepping out of their comfort zone?</strong><br/>
I hope so. We&#8217;ve asked artists who have what it takes to adapt and experiment in new situations. I think it&#8217;s a myth anyway that pop/rock artists operate from within a ?comfort zone?. In their own ways those forms are just as innovative and radical as so called ?experimental? music. It&#8217;s about the specific qualities of the artists involved rather than the genre classifications. </p>
<p><strong>What do you think Overground brings to the Jazz Festival?</strong><br/>
Overground is a kind of radical proposition for how to experience and approach cutting edge music. It&#8217;s a space within the festival that foregrounds experimentation and risk and involves as many artists as possible in that project. The possibilities are more open and unpredictable than in any formal or regular concert setting, so we ask the artists and audience to kind of enter into the spirit of that and celebrate it. There are plenty of artists participating in Overground who would never have expected to take part in a ?jazz festival? and that is a big achievement of the event, the extent to which it extends the notion and scope of ?jazz? to support all these divergent practices. I think it&#8217;s a way for the jazz festival to test its boundaries and to situate itself as an enabler in a really exciting and unclassifiable area of music and art.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of audience do you expect?</strong><br/>
Anyone with open ears and open mind.</p>
