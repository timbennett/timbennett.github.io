                <h3>With the SxSW music industry shindig about to kick off in Austin, Texas, <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> talks to two festival veterans about whether it&#8217;s worth making the cross-Pacific trek.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3003178/320x380-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="320" height="380"/><br/>
Let&#8217;s face it. Unless you&#8217;re a once-in-a-generation band like Taxiride, cracking the US market will inevitably elude you. Australia&#8217;s musical landscape is littered with US roadkill &#8211; from Cold Chisel to You Am I, Pacifier to Powderfinger.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re going to break into the US, there&#8217;s no better place to do it &#8211; on paper at least &#8211; than South by Southwest (SxSW). Held annually in Austin, Texas, the event attracts more than 50,000 people from the international music industry including bookers, promoters, lawyers, agents, labels, writers and scouts all on the hunt for the next big thing. Trouble is, there are lots of bands too &#8211; about 2000 in fact ?<br/>
claiming to be that ?thing?.</p>
<p>?There are just so many bands playing it makes your head spin,? says Lucy Phelan, one half of Sydney experimental duo Naked on the Vague, who are making their second bow at the festival this week. ?Lots of weird dudes on the street flicking their band&#8217;s business cards at you, trying to convince you to check ?em out while also pleading how, ?We&#8217;re all in this together, man.??</p>
<p>Phelan and her NOTV cohort Matthew Hopkins will be doing no such thing at SxSW this year. The band were invited back to the festival by influential US label Siltbreeze (Psychedelic Horseshit, Sic Alps, Times New Viking), and will play a label showcase at Soho Lounge in downtown Austin on March 19. While their maiden SxSW showcase in 2008 was beset by sound issues &#8211; ?The metal head dudes behind the sound desk couldn&#8217;t get the right side of the PA to work during our set? &#8211; they still made some worthwhile connections.</p>
<p>?We got to meet Tom Lax from Siltbreeze and all the other label bands,? explains Phelan. ?I think it was definitely important for us to go over to the US to show that we&#8217;re keen beans for touring and that we can pull off a live show. We&#8217;ve had many offers from various indie labels in the US to put out records etc, and that all seemed to happen during the US tour [last year].?</p>
<p>As for this year, Phelan has more modest aims.</p>
<p>?We&#8217;re hoping that some eccentric old punk who happens to own a mansion up in the Hamptons asks us to come and live there, and they will provide a full studio so we can work on our next album between walking our twin Basset Hounds,? she jokes. ?But seriously, we just hope to meet some good people who might help out with future tours and records, peddle our wares, play some music, see some music and have an all round good time.?</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3003177/640x480-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="480"/>
<p>The band are part of the largest ever Australian contingent to descend upon SxSW &#8211; an impressive 31 acts ranging from pop household names (Gabriella Cilmi, Josh Pyke and Guy Sebastian) to indie heavyweights (The Drones, The Grates and Youth Group) and relative minnows (Brisbane&#8217;s An Horse and Melbourne&#8217;s The Hot Kicks). So does hailing from the ?wilds? of Australia really give bands like NOTV an edge?</p>
<p>?Well, the people that I came across hadn&#8217;t really heard of any contemporary Australian bands really,? says Phelan. ?But generally people are really interested, and I think Australia&#8217;s reputation is growing, especially for the type of music we&#8217;re involved with.?</p>
<p>Events such as the Aussie BBQ and Sounds Australia House aim to boost the profile of Australian acts at SxSW by hosting day-long events with free booze and snags. While well-attended &#8211; the Aussie BBQ has been voted best ?day party? at SxSW for the past three years &#8211; less than half of the Australian bands at SxSW are invited to play. The others are effectively left to their own devices.</p>
<p>?There are just so many bands playing it probably helps to have a bit of a name for yourself or an association with a label before you play SxSW,? says Phelan.</p>
<p>Sydney one-man party machine Spod agrees.</p>
<p>?Maybe it&#8217;s a slight bonus [being Australian],? he says. ?But unless someone influential is propping you up, or you&#8217;re on a label that&#8217;s on the promo patrol, or you&#8217;re on a cool party, don&#8217;t expect anyone aside from incidentals to care.?</p>
<p>Spod, who attended SxSW in 2007, but isn&#8217;t making a return visit this year, says the 20-hour trek to Austin was well worth it &#8211; even Tex Perkins got to see him play.</p>
<img class="c" data-src="/images/3003176/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="640" height="427"/>
<p>?[He] thought I was wicked, which was lovely! I played before them [The Beasts of Bourbon] on the Aussie BBQ, which was cool fun &#8211; We then had our own showcase playing before Thomas Dolby. That in itself was hilarious!?</p>
<p>Like most Australian acts who attend SxSW, Spod used the shindig as a platform for a US tour. With the help of Stagemothers, the non-profit artist support group who host the Aussie BBQ, he played showcases in New York and later toured the US extensively on his own steam. He says playing a showcase at SxSW alone isn&#8217;t recommended &#8211; unless, of course, ?you love blowing money?.</p>
<p>?Use SxSW as a springboard to a visa and to get on other tours,? he says.</p>
<p>All up, Spod&#8217;s US jaunt set him back $15,000, which covered visas, flights, accommodation and other travel expenses for himself and his guitarist. As for funding? It&#8217;s a bit like witchcraft, he says.</p>
<p>?I see a lot of bands with major labels getting all the funding, because it can be justified as an export investment to bring back money into Australia, if that makes sense. So if you&#8217;re a full band, you better have a trust fund or a human with deep pockets!?</p>
<p>Still, would he do it all again?</p>
<p>?I had a great time, but I do everything myself, and didn&#8217;t know anyone, so no one really gave a shit unless they happened to see me. Then they were into it. I got some good hook-ups in New York from playing though.?</p>
<p>As for Phelan and NOTV, the band were lucky enough to receive some money from the Australia Council for the Arts? ?Live On Stage? grant, which partly funded their trip. They also held a fundraiser show at Serial Space in their native Sydney in February.</p>
<p>?I think that if a band was going over to the US just for SXSW, they would be looking at a cost of around $6000 per person,? she says.</p>
<p>SxSW runs until March 22 in Austin, Texas.</p>
