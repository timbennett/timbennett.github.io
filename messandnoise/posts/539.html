                <h3>Ahead of a joint show at Melbourne&#8217;s Corner Hotel, <strong>JEN CLOHER<em>* and *</em>JORDIE LANE</strong> chat from opposite hemispheres about self-management, future recordings and celebrity-spotting in the States. The pair will perform new material; songs from their most recent albums &#8216;Hidden Hands&#8217; and &#8216;Sleeping Patterns&#8217;, respectively; and classic duets and covers including their take on MGMT&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=tliQPLCKWNQ">&#8216;Electric Feel&#8217;</a>.

Jen Cloher: So Jordie, as we talk, where are you right now?</p>
<p>Jordie Lane: I am sitting in the kitchen of a first-floor apartment in Bed-Stuy [Bedford&#8217;Stuyvesant], which is in Brooklyn, New York. Just cooked a huge brekky of poached eggs, crispy bacon, stewed tomato and okra. Its a beautiful crisp sunny morning. It&#8217;s autumn/fall here now so all the leaves are golden and red and falling everywhere. What&#8217;s your geographical location right now? </p>
<p>JC: I am sitting in my home in Melbourne, making the most of my first coffee for the day and working on a new song. I&#8217;ve been writing duets because I have never done it before and I got tired of sitting around writing by myself all the time. At the moment I am working on some lyrics to a song I&#8217;ve been writing with Kieran from Kid Sam. </p>
<p>JL: Since we high-fived at the airport and swapped hemispheres, you have been back in Australia involved in the John Butler Seed Management Workshop. Tell me what that&#8217;s all about?</p>
<p>JC: John offers the scholarship each year to about 20 managers &#8211; both self managed like myself as well as artist-managers. You get flown to the Blue Mountains, accommodated and fed, with the cream of the Australian music biz dropping in over the week to impart their wisdom &#8211; a sweet deal. The intimacy of the workshop meant there was no room to pull any rank, it&#8217;s just flat out discussion about what works and the mistakes people have made along the way. Quote of the week came from John Watson who manages Gotye and silverchair: ?Management is the art of creating the perception of success.?  I think I need to get a manager! What are your first impressions of the US of A?</p>
<p>JL: Well I&#8217;ve been here for almost three months now, but my first impressions were very positive, and I&#8217;m happy to say they still are. I&#8217;m ashamed to admit I had many misconceptions about what it would be.<br/>
I think as Australians we can be quite narrow-minded about what the culture and the people are like here, and they proved me wrong. It really is so diverse in its landscape and the different feel of each city, but wherever I go I feel the warmth of good-hearted people, and the refreshing attitude that folks have when it comes to going out and doing what you wanna do.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I made some calls, hired a car, and got back out to the desert. And began writing all the songs from scratch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>JC: I hear you have been recording your second album, how did that come about?</p>
<p>JL: I won&#8217;t tell you the whole story now, but &#8230; In no way did I think I was coming to the USA to make an album, but a chain of strange, exciting and sad circumstances led to the album having to be made. It all started in the Californian desert, out at the Joshua Tree, where a bunch of crazy things happened. Then after a few months of traveling round the rest of the country, I never got on the LA flight home. I made some calls, hired a car, and got back out to the desert. And began writing all the songs from scratch.</p>
<p>JC: Where are you recording? Has it been with a band? </p>
<p>JL: It was recorded between a Joshua Tree motel room and a suburban basement in Echo Park, LA. The whole band was just me and anything at my disposal in the room at the time. So plastic boxes, wine glasses, banjo skins and a $10 harmonium from the bargain store down the road all got an appearance. It was a really organic but manic process which formed a life of its own and has created a completely different sound to anything I have done before. You mentioned you caught up with Mia Dyson when you were over here in June and recorded a song with her, what was that like?</p>
<p>JC: Mia is the first person I have ever written a song with. We were hanging at her place in Noho, that&#8217;s North Hollywood, you feel me? North Hollywood by the way is not very Hollywood. In fact it&#8217;s full of cheap tattoo/clairvoyant parlours and roadside taco caravans. Let&#8217;s just say you don&#8217;t go wandering around there by yourself at night. We wrote the song in a couple of hours and were in the studio recording it the next day. I always had a lot of fear around co-writing, it&#8217;s a bit like a first date, the other person gets to see you stumbling through your first ideas which is quite a vulnerable place to be. I loved writing with Mia, it was much easier than I thought it would be and it gave me the confidence to keep asking other songwriters on first dates.</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3016178/448x298-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
JL: And hanging out with Dave Stewart of Eurhythmics fame, did he ever take his sunglasses off?</p>
<p>JC: No. He kept his sunglasses on when we met, but they had a little bit of the Bonos about them so you could still see his eyes. Mia was mixing some songs in his studio so I was curious to check out his empire. He has serious entourage. I wandered around looking at all the gold records on the walls, the Eurythmics sold 300 million albums in their day. I was a fan. I remember going to their show when I was 10 at Memorial Drive in Adelaide, the one where Annie wore a red bra. Anyhow, I digress. Dave came into the studio in his suit and hat and walked up to me and shook my hand. We had a chat about the music scene in London in the early ?80s. Later on, his personal assistant showed me a new range of vibrators Dave is releasing onto the market. Seriously, he pulled one out of a box, it was a gold bullet with encrusted diamonds. I think they retail for about $800, just a little out of my price bracket. So what&#8217;s the best thing that has happened so far? </p>
<p>JL: Reconnecting with my love for music and finding my own creative juices flowing again. Oh, and all the tacos, and the mountains, and the cheap beer, the amazing people I have met. But I almost forgot that the single best thing was meeting Alec Baldwin in Greenwich Village. </p>
<p>JC: Worst thing?</p>
<p>JL: Getting food poisoning down at Venice Beach, and having to spend hours in a hospital waiting room, before the ever so lovely  IV drip and a bunch of needles made me new again.</p>
<p>JC: What can people expect on your return shows?</p>
<p>JL: A lot of silly road stories, and then a lot more silly road stories. new songs, and new approach to many things. And I have been practicing guitar and banjo a lot while I&#8217;m away, so I don&#8217;t feel half bad on them either.</p>
