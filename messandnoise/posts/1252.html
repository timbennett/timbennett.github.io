                <h3>M+N are asking bands about classic Australian albums &#8211; both the idea of a classic and some prime examples &#8211; as well as posing a few polite questions.
</h3>
<p>Answering this week is Alex Badham, who shares the Melbourne electro-pop duo Magic Hands with Lucy Roleff. Their self-produced debut album <em><a href="http://magichands.bandcamp.com/album/let-me-hold-you-while-you-fail ">Let Me Hold You While You Fail</a></em> came out last Friday through Finger Wave Records. It launches this Friday (Sept 12) at Circle Jerk #9 at The Imperial Hotel in Sydney with Males, Snowy Nasdaq, TV Programmes and Lovely Head, and on Saturday, September 20 at The Gasometer in Melbourne with Zone Out and Alyx Dennison.</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p><strong>a. Alex, you&#8217;ve directed three videos for the band so far. Was that strong visual component part of Magic Hands from the start?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re both pretty active in visual media type stuff, so we&#8217;re pretty self-sufficient in that sense. I just like making music videos, and I play in a band &#8211; So it seems natural that we&#8217;ve already got three videos in the can.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re pretty aware of how we&#8217;re not the most riveting band to watch playing live (a common hurdle for electronic bands, I guess), so we definitely knew from the start that wanted to put a lot of work into creating other things for the audience to look at/get hypnotised by when we perform. Video projections, lo-fi LED light show, etc. </p>

<p/>
<p><strong>b. The album was written between Melbourne, Berlin and rural Victoria. How quickly and/or easily did it all come together, from writing to recording?</strong><br/>
Writing and recording is basically all one process for us: we own most of the stuff we need to be able to do it without going into studios. I&#8217;m always pretty blown away by how quickly we write songs: we basically get a song 86.458% done after a day or so of writing/tinkering, then spend months and months endlessly slotting that final 13.542% in place.</p>
<p><strong>c. Lucy has a great <a href="/search/?q=lucy+roleff">solo career</a> going. Alex, are you doing anything musically on the side right now? What&#8217;s the status of <a href="/news/4628413">Batman Park</a> and <a href="/search/?q=aleks+and+the+ramps">Aleks &amp; The Ramps</a>?</strong><br/>
Batman Park was definitely a one-time thing. As much as it was a really super fun and great thing to be involved in, I think we&#8217;re all happy to leave it at that. I&#8217;ve been intermittently working on a solo thing for the past two years or so that may never get finished. My pals at <a href="http://theapiary.com.au">The Apiary</a> shot a really great music video for one of the songs, which I got naked for. I know everyone&#8217;s dying to see that, so it&#8217;d be a waste not to release it.</p>
<p>The Ramps &#8211; that&#8217;s not really a thing anymore. Lucy&#8217;s working on her next solo record, which will be KILLER.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Classic?</h2>
<p><strong>a. What are some defining qualities that make a classic record?</strong><br/>
Good songs, well produced, released at the exact moment to be considered part of the zeitgeist, guest spot from Ghostface Killah and a Yngwie Malmsteen guitar solo.</p>
<p><strong>b. Name a recent Australian record that already feels like a classic.</strong><br/>
I love the shit outta <em><a href="/releases/2000955">Work (work, work)</a></em> by HTRK. I haven&#8217;t properly gotten around to listening to <a href="/releases/2001330">their new one</a> yet. It&#8217;s probably real great though.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mqO5rbXCLLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>c. What was the first classic Australian record someone introduced you to?</strong><br/>
Hmmm &#8211; not sure if anyone considers it a ?classic? but I have vague memories of liking a Screaming Jets album when I was a kid. Looking at their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<em>Screaming</em>Jets">Wikipedia</a> now, I think I had <em>Tear of Thought</em> on cassette. That&#8217;s a good example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear<em>of</em>Thought#mediaviewer/File:Tear<em>of</em>Thought.JPG">cover art</a> representing the music really well &#8211; in that it&#8217;s truly fucking awful.</p>
<p><strong>d. Is there a classic ?Australian sound?? If so, what is it?</strong><br/>
If I was playing a word-association game and someone said ?Classic Australian sound? I&#8217;d probably sing the synth line from ?Great Southern Land? back at them. (You know &#8211; ?Great southern Land? bow-bow-bow.?) </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3mkidP2OUCk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>e. Who&#8217;s your favourite Australian producer, past or present?</strong><br/>
That&#8217;s a tough one. I don&#8217;t really know the careers of many producers that well. I love the production on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children<em>of</em>Telepathic_Experiences">the second Gerling record</a>, when they went from scrappy guitar band (which was awesome) to spacey disco dance act. That was probably self-produced right? So I&#8217;m going to go with Gerling. Yeah.</p>
<h2>Five Potential Classics</h2>
<p>Tell us what these five contenders for classic album status mean to you:</p>
<p><strong>Kylie Minogue</strong> <em>Ultimate Kylie</em> (2004)<br/>
It took me awhile to come around on Kylie: I used to write her off as a poor man&#8217;s Madonna (with added disco) but I am now wholeheartedly a Kylie fan. Gosh &#8211; feels good to finally get that out in the open. I&#8217;m not so into her early hits, or that weird wine-bar-chillout style production she has occasionally, but she&#8217;s got some awesome slick and overproduced pop gems. How good is <a href="http://vimeo.com/36492409">?Slow?</a>? SO GOOD.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Skyhooks</strong> <em>Living in the 70s</em> (1974)<br/>
I can recall three Skyhooks tracks off the top my head, and I hate ?em all. Mostly just because Red Symonds is a cock. I&#8217;m not going to get into it here, but I had a weird run-in with him in North Fitzroy once, from which we both emerged as massive jerks, but him more so.</p>
<p><strong>The Go-Betweens</strong>: choose your favourite album of theirs<br/>
So yeah, this is an opinion that I usually keep to myself, because they seem to be one of those infallible bands that gets everyone right here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch&#8217;v=3XDmasbARtE"><em>taps on heart-area-chest-region-place</em>] but I don&#8217;t really like The Go-Betweens. I actually can&#8217;t name any of their albums. They made that [Prime TV song</a> right? Guess that&#8217;s an OK song. (I don&#8217;t speak for Lucy on this one. She likes them)</p>
<p><strong>Sunnyboys</strong> <em>Sunnyboys</em> (1981)<br/>
Hmm &#8211; I&#8217;ve definitely seen the name before, but it&#8217;s not ringing a bell. I have no idea who this band is.</p>
<p>OK so I looked them up and they sing that ?alone with you toniiiiiight? song. Cool. I wonder if they named themselves after <a href="http://www.sunnyboy.com.au/images/water<em>ice</em>3_group2.jpg">those weird triangular ice confections</a> that were really difficult to eat? Obviously I have nothing insightful to say about this record/band.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/b2D84Ma-CxI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>You Am I</strong> <em>Hourly, Daily</em> (1996)<br/>
There was a period of time when I was kid that I thought this band was written ?U.M.I?. What a little doofus I was. All of their earlier albums meld into the same one in my head, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what songs are on this one. Guess I could got on le interwebs and reacquaint myself with their discography, but I feel like that&#8217;d be cheating. Plus, I got shit to do.</p>
<p>Side note: <a href="/articles/4664560">My friend</a>?s uncle [Wayne Connolly] won an ARIA for producing this record, and I held it in my hands. (Let&#8217;s be honest, the only time I&#8217;m going to hold an ARIA.) And sweet jesus those things are deadly blocks of heavy, sharp metal. You could hijack a plane with one, if you could get it through security.</p>
