                <h3>Off the local radar for the past few years, Expatriate&#8217;s Ben King tells <strong>DARREN LEVIN</strong> he&#8217;s eager to put the band on the map in Australia again.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3026584/440x293-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
When Expatriate play the <em>M+N* Lunchbox at Sydney&#8217;s Goodgod this Friday, it&#8217;ll be just their third show on home turf in more than three years. The quartet &#8211; guitarist-singer Ben King, drummer Cristo, bassist Dave Molland and keyboardist/guitarist Damian Press &#8211; left Australia for Europe following the release of their ARIA-nominated debut *<a href="/releases/5647">In The Midst Of This</a></em> in 2007. But unlike most Aussie ex-pats, whose European dreams end up on the living room floor of a grotty sharehouse in Hackney, Expatriate have managed to eek out a career in their adopted home city of Berlin.</p>
<p>They signed a record deal with [PIAS] International; got snapped up by the London-based Riverman Management; sold out headline shows in Switzerland, France, Germany, UK and Greece; and embarked on an arena tour across seven countries as main support to Placebo. It&#8217;s why their protracted second album is called <em>Hyper/Hearts</em>. Recorded at Wales? Monnow Valley Studios with producer Andy Savours (PNAU, The Killers), and later finished in their home studio in Berlin, it&#8217;s a titular nod to these heady past few years. </p>
<p>?It&#8217;s a reference to that feeling,? King told <em>M+N</em> a few weeks after returning to Sydney at the tail-end of 2011. ?Your heart&#8217;s racing, and everything is hyper-coloured. That&#8217;s been the last few years for us &#8211; even though people here were probably thinking, ?What the fuck happened to that band???</p>
<p>To redress that the band will base themselves in Sydney until at least March when <em>Hyper/Hearts</em> finally hits shelves through Dew Process. After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess, says King. ?Depending on how the record goes here, we&#8217;ll go back over to Europe when it comes out there in July or August.?</p>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;re back in Sydney now. I guess it&#8217;s changed a lot over the past few years?</strong><br/>
It has. It&#8217;s a hell of a lot more expensive, especially when compared to Berlin. It&#8217;s a strange feeling. There&#8217;s so much familiarity, but there&#8217;s also a lot of news faces and places to get your head around.</p>
<p><strong>Few less pubs to play, unfortunately.</strong><br/>
That does suck, but from what I can tell, there are a few more Melbourne-style watering holes, which is nice for a change. But especially <a href="/news/3761449">The Hopetoun</a>, where we cut our teeth &#8211; it was so sad to drive past that and see it all boarded up.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever intend to be in Europe for so long?</strong><br/>
We didn&#8217;t intend to be there for three years. We didn&#8217;t leave until the end of 2008, and our record came out in 2009, so we spent basically the whole year just touring, doing festivals, supporting other bands (we did a big run with Placebo), and just doing our own club shows. That was a really busy year. It was an amazing year too, to basically go to just about everywhere and have that opportunity. We always, in the back of our mind, wanted to get cracking on the second record. That didn&#8217;t happen until after 2009 when we stopped touring. We put down all these demos, about 40 songs, and sent that to producers.</p>
<p>The producer thing took forever to lock in. We had one person who was locked in to do it, and they pulled out, so that set us back three months. 2010 was about getting the record done. 2011 was finishing it. Now we&#8217;re putting it out. It&#8217;s taken that long to do it.</p>
<p><strong>The press release announcing your comeback came out of the blue a bit for Australian audiences.</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve come back thinking, ?God, does anyone remember what we&#8217;ve done, or who we are?? There&#8217;s trepidation mixed with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>Home is still Berlin?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s definitely a base for us. We have a place over there that we&#8217;re renting, my girlfriend lives there. It&#8217;s definitely a place we&#8217;ll go back to quite a bit. It&#8217;s this artistic hub, but it&#8217;s also front-and-centre of Europe, so it&#8217;s easy to get on a bus and tour. Hopefully, we can split our time between here and there.</p>
<p><strong>There was a recent <a href="/articles/4357979">interview</a> on <em>M+N</em> with Ned Collette. Do you know Ned?</strong><br/>
Yeah, I do. I had a beer with him over there ages ago.</p>
<p><strong>He said the music scene in Berlin is a bit more of a transient thing, not really a strong community like Melbourne or Sydney.</strong><br/>
We went there thinking we&#8217;d find this amazing, integrated community of musicians and artists in general. But our experience was what Ned was talking about. It&#8217;s such a transient place. You make friends, but then everyone leaves and does other things. They come in and out of town at will. It makes it hard to feel grounded there in a way. That&#8217;s the thing about coming back to Sydney and getting back into your own clique with your old friends. On a friendship level it&#8217;s hard to find [in Berlin]. Unless you know a lot of native Germans, it can be hard to forge your way into some sort of community over there.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Australian ex-pat scene over there particularly close?</strong><br/>
Kind of. In 2010 we were hanging out a lot more with Australians. The Dukes of Windsor guys were living over there, and they knew other people from Melbourne who we didn&#8217;t know. And likewise with us and people from Sydney. They left and we had to bunker down and make a record, so our social life sort of stopped.</p>
<p><strong>Is it the same Expatriate line-up that left here in 2008?</strong><br/>
Yep, all four of us.</p>
<p><strong>You recorded the album at Monnow Valley, a pretty iconic studio in Wales [Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Queen have recorded there].</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s quite amazing just the physicality of it. It&#8217;s in the middle of the sticks. You look out your window and there&#8217;s a paddock of sheep. It was snowing. It felt like we were trapped in this submarine. It was six, or seven guys &#8211; with our producer and two assistants &#8211; in this house that was over 100 years old. There&#8217;s been a lot of iconic musicians that have come through and made records &#8211; Oasis did their first one there. So we were out in the middle of nowhere and it was an intense experience because of that. I&#8217;ve never made a record in the middle of a crazy city. We always seem to find ourselves removed from that.</p>
<p><strong>Is it close to Rockfield? I guess that&#8217;s the other famous studio out in Wales <a href="/articles/3719764">read about Violent Soho&#8217;s experiences at Rockfield [here</a>].</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s down the road, about a 10 minute drive. There&#8217;s definitely a lot of music making in that area.</p>
<img class="" data-src="/images/3026585/640x427-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/>
<p><strong>What was it like working with Andy Savours [PNAU, The Killers]?</strong><br/>
He was cool. Producers are always a unique bunch of people. [<em>Laughs</em>] We wanted to work with someone pretty fresh. After the first record, we wanted to get away from it sounding so clear and rigid. It was also a bit more stripped back than what we intended it to be. With this record we wanted to fuck things up a bit more: run guitars through Ableton, or junky speakers. He was really in touch with us on that. He cut his teeth working with Flood and Alan Moulder. He was their prot&#8217;g?, so to speak. He was on our wave length.</p>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3026586/440x336-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
We just worked our arses off for four weeks. We came out with three-quarters of the record done, but it wasn&#8217;t quite there. [Keyboardist/guitarist] Damien [Press] and I ended up taking it back to Berlin. We had our own little studio set up in our apartment with our gear. It took another three or fourth months of extra work to finish it.</p>
<p><strong>I guess that&#8217;s the thing with home recording. You can work on it forever if you wanted to.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s a good and bad thing. You can really just go up your arse, but we had a pretty clear idea. In Wales we got the band dynamic and energy [down], but we didn&#8217;t have time to do all the fuckery and layering that we wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>?Miracle Mile? has, in my head at least, that ?80s Australian pop-rock sound going on, like The Models, those sorts of bands. Is that something you were going for, or is my radar totally off?</strong><br/>
We love those bands, obviously we&#8217;re influenced by that era of music, but the whole thing with ?Miracle Mile? was that it started off as a completely different beast. It wasn&#8217;t as pulsating as it is now. That was actually Andy in the studio running a bass part through a box, and then another box, getting that ?wow wow? thing that starts off the song &#8211; It&#8217;s interesting because nothing else on the record sounds like it in a way. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>That was my next question.</strong><br/>
The rest of the record has a lot more going on in terms of ear candy; things popping in and out, rather than the linear drums-bass-guitar-keys. You always struggle with the first song to put out, but it seemed like a good place to start.</p>

<p><strong>Has the album got that dance crossover thing going on?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;d say no, if anything. It&#8217;s definitely got four-to-the-floor moments, but it&#8217;s a lot more atmospheric. We wanted to open the sonic palette more and get a bit tasty with everything as opposed to falling back on anything we&#8217;ve done before.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s more a headphones record?</strong><br/>
I would definitely say that, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Have you embraced an ?Australian sound? more since being away? It happens to a lot of bands.</strong><br/>
I was listening to so much different music when I was writing this record. All four of us have such different taste. I&#8217;m at a loss to describe where the influences come from to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the title a reference to?</strong><br/>
The experience we&#8217;ve had in the past three years. We were in this hyper state of existence. We were a band in Australia that put a record out that did OK. We got picked up by a really great management company in the UK [Riverman Management] and they basically gave us an opportunity to come over to Europe, put a record out and tour, and do everything you&#8217;d dream of doing &#8211; We didn&#8217;t know anyone over there, none of us had been to Berlin, we had no idea what we were walking into.</p>

<p><strong>Obviously, the Placebo tour was the highpoint of that experience?</strong><br/>
It was 26 dates. The biggest place they pull crowds is France. We did 10 shows in France in arenas, which was amazing for us. We did sold-out headline shows in Paris. France embraced us more than Germany. They [Placebo] were really gracious people. They were so nice to us. It was a six-week tour, so we went everywhere: France, Helsinki, Istanbul, Greece. Placebo have been around for a while, but they still have really young new fans. It kinda surprised me &#8211; Placebo fans either love you or hate you. Luckily, we went down well with them.</p>
<p><strong>How important is it for you to get back on the radar here? It sounds like you&#8217;re taking really big strides in Europe.</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really important. I really want to make sure we can get things back to the way things were in Australia. I fucking love it here. There&#8217;s never been a concerted decision to not come back, or snub the place. It&#8217;s just been one thing after another in Europe, making the record and taking opportunities when they came up. Australia is super important to me. Everything started for us here. It&#8217;s our home. I can&#8217;t wait to get back out here.</p>
<p><strong>Does it feel like starting again?</strong><br/>
[<em>Laughs</em>] It does, definitely. It&#8217;s a really strange feeling, but exciting as well. It&#8217;s what you&#8217;d expect after being away for three years. You don&#8217;t expect to rock back into town and selling out big rooms. It&#8217;s slowly but surely.</p>
