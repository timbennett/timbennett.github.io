<h2>?Acting Fine?</h2>
<p>I think I wrote this song during a period when I felt a little stagnant and the lyrics reflect that. It&#8217;s about wanting to find something that&#8217;s worth sticking your neck out a little for. I suppose I was just sick of my job at the time and felt like my time and my energy could be put more in the direction of the things and the people that I love. Biddy Connor who played viola on the record created a really lovely string arrangement that just floats in and out of what the melody is doing. I was really happy with the way it ended up with a kind of restless cinematic quality to it with the strings and organ part warbling away and her voice coming in and out.</p>

<h2>?Say Your Goodnights To The Moon?</h2>
<p>I used to have a lot of trouble sleeping and would often go for days in a sort of zombie-like state before completely crashing. I think I was trying to take stock of the things that had been overwhelming me and willing myself to sleep. We staggered the instrumentation of this one so that it feels like a gradually building march. With Jen [Sholakis?] percussion, Laura [Jean&#8217;s] keyboard line and [partner] Lia [Tsamoglou&#8217;s] voice I guess it&#8217;s a bit like the world is gradually coming back into focus if you wanted to relate the parts to the narrative. Lia and Simon [Grounds, producer] came up with a really lovely round-style choral harmony in the second chorus which is very cathartic for me when I listen back to it.</p>

<h2>?Greet The Sunrise?</h2>
<p>This is a love song but it&#8217;s probably quite influenced by my not being able to sleep as well. When we listened back to this song I remember Simon and Biddy all saying that it had a nice old fashioned duet feel to it. When I listen to it I think Lia and I sound like we&#8217;re comforting each other in the chorus which is nice. Again Biddy contributed some wonderfully intuitive and emotionally sensitive parts to this song.</p>

<h2>?A Message From The Cliffs?</h2>
<p>This is the least and the most autobiographical song on the record if that makes any sense. The narrative is about someone getting word that a loved one has drowned. The song was written about a week after my stepfather died of cancer so I was definitely feeling a lot of anger and grief at the time that I wrote it. A couple of days before we flew to Melbourne to record with Simon a friend of ours died suddenly. I flew back to Sydney from the first recording session and we went straight to his funeral from the airport. I think listening back to this track particularly I can tell that there was heavy stuff going on for me at the time. Biddy&#8217;s viola playing in this song is so beautiful and scary and when Lia&#8217;s voice comes in she sounds like a ghost. Since we started playing this one with the band I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever really played it the same way twice. Robin Dixon who plays cello and Jon Hunter who plays guitar have been really reactive to how the singing and the energy in the room changes each time. It makes it really exciting.</p>

<h2>?Loaded Dice?</h2>
<p>I wrote this one while Lia was recording her album <a href="/releases/2000891">Melodie Nelson&#8217;s <em>[Meditations on the Sun</a></em>] with Tony Dupe in Wildes Meadow, which is just above the Kangaroo Valley [in NSW]. I think she was recording drum machine or something, which was pretty time consuming and I was wandering around the property playing guitar and singing to the cows on the neighbouring property. It&#8217;s funny when you sing to cows they all come running up and look at you with this really perplexed look on their face. Some of them were huge, and they&#8217;re a very attentive audience. Lia named a duet that we sang together on her record ?Bovine Blues?, after her and Tony caught me singing to the cows. </p>
<p>I really like the shuffling percussion that Laura Jean played on this one. The guitars and the beat have a kind of wonky thing happening. When we were doing overdubs on this one, Laura and Jen&#8217;s puppies were running around in the backyard, which probably helped give things an easygoing canine vibe.</p>

<h2>?Tried and Trying?</h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when this song ended up with a truck stop kind of feel to it. It&#8217;s one the oldest songs on the record and it&#8217;s the only song on the record that has a traditional drum kit on it. I&#8217;d been listening to a lot of <em>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</em> by The Byrds, and the records Gram Parsons did with Emmylou Harris. That influence probably inspired me to honk it up a bit with the guitar line in the chorus. Lyrically, I think this song is about living in Sydney and not really feeling like you&#8217;re not making the cut. It can be a pretty dog-eat-dog kind of town.</p>

<h2>?Spreading Secrets?</h2>
<p>This is one of a two songs on the record that talk about the idea of uprooting yourself from where you are and what you&#8217;ve been surrounded by. I find the combination of Biddy&#8217;s viola parts and Laura&#8217;s wandering piano in this one really affecting when I listen back to it. I feel like they were very much in touch with the fragility that I was trying to express in the lyrics. Simon bashed out these piano chords on his upright in the chorus that ended up sounding like timpani drums.</p>

<h2>?Wandering West?</h2>
<p>This song was written during a period when a lot of close friends of mine who were couples were breaking up. I was probably thinking about the way people who love eachother can be pulled apart almost by forces that are not in their control. I think my desire to live in the middle of nowhere for a little while probably snuck into the themes as well. The piano line that Lia plays gave the chorus a sort of lonely gothic feel.</p>

<h2>?Routine and War?</h2>
<p>I wrote this song when Lia and I were living together in the city. I was pretty broke at the time and pretty depressed as well. I was really struck by how cutthroat the city was. There were a lot of people living in the area that were doing it pretty rough, and there was incredible affluence and decadence everywhere as well. I think the thing that really served as a good metaphor for how I felt about that area was when an upmarket organic grocer opened directly underneath the homeless youth hostel. I think I was having a really hard time finding a way that I could make a living in that setting without becoming a part of a structure where people seemed to have such little regard for those right under their noses. It&#8217;s still something I struggle with. </p>
<p>The viola parts that Biddy brought to this one have a particularly icy, cinematic quality to them. I think it brings a real drama to the song. Simon was in an incredible psychedelic pop band called <a href="/icons/3817018">The Shower Scene From Psycho</a>, which made these wild re-workings of ?60s pop hits. When we recorded Biddy&#8217;s parts on this song I remember we were joking that they had a bit of a Norman Bates feel, which is a nice way for me to be reminded of Simon&#8217;s immeasurable contributions to the record.</p>

<h2>?When The Others Have Gone?</h2>
<p>I thought it would be a good idea to have one song on the record that was just guitar and singing.  I like to make sure the songs are strong enough to work with guitar and voice before thinking about adding any arrangements. It&#8217;s really the core of what I do. This song is about me reflecting on my 8 year relationship with Lia and think about the comfort that we&#8217;re able to find in each other when so many parts of our life have changed so drastically. Lia says it&#8217;s her favourite song on the album but she&#8217;s probably pretty biased considering it was written for her.</p>
