                <h3>Taking its cues from Sup Pop, Sydney label Spunk has released a ?Singles Club? compilation of its own &#8211; and it&#8217;s already paying dividends for two emerging bands. <strong>TIM SCOTT</strong> reports.
</h3>
<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3002729/440x356-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="356"/><br/>
Back in the late ?80s music geeks around the globe clamored to get their hands on a Sub Pop limited edition 7?. From 1988-1993, the iconic Seattle label would mail subscribers vinyl gems on a monthly basis through its ?Singles Club?. We&#8217;re talking Nirvana, Sonic Youth/Mudhoney and The Flaming Lips. And that was just the first three releases.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Sydney&#8217;s Spunk records latest compilation, <em>Spunk Singles Club</em>, showcases 12 burgeoning Australian artists from Adelaide to Avoca to Townsville.</p>
<p>?I started the idea based on what Sub Pop did in the ?90s and what roo Art did in the late ?80s, early ?90s with their <em>Young Blood</em> compilation,? explains Spunk&#8217;s Aaron Curnow. ?I wanted to find an avenue for new Australian unsigned artists to be heard. I also thought I could use it as an A&amp;R tool myself to sign a few more Australian acts down the track.?</p>
<p>Good idea. Bad economic times.</p>
<p>?What I originally wanted to do was release a separate 7&#8243; of 10 new unsigned artists,? says Curnow. ?But after getting a quote this soon became financially impossible, as 10 separate 7&#8243;s were going to cost approximately $25,000. So we changed tack and decided to release the [now] 12 acts on a vinyl album and a CD compilation.??</p>
<p>While the credit crunch may be bad news for vinyl enthusiasts, collectors and geeks, it&#8217;s good news for those with limited funds: one record, 12 emerging musical acts. The record covers all corners &#8211; both geographically and musically. There&#8217;s the quiet electronic ambience of Sydney&#8217;s Seekae, the broken-down rock of Melbourne&#8217;s Super Wild Horses and The Harpoons and the down tempo indie of Perth&#8217;s Apricot Rail </p>
<p>?A work experience kid of mine, Evan Williams, is so ?on it? in terms of Australian music. We basically had pick for pick. He chose all the interesting artists,? he jokes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m most exited about the potential adventures that may occur on the road &#8211; Swimming in the ocean in every new town and meeting new people with different stories.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>?Our basic aim was to choose an artist from each state and hopefully find a few artists from outside of the main metro cities. Most of my favourite artists around the world tend to come from smaller towns and country areas.?</p>
<p>What started as a fanzine back in 1994, Spunk has since developed into one the country&#8217;s most respected indie labels and tour operators having worked with the likes of Will Oldham, Calexico, Mogwai, Antony and the Johnsons as well as local faves Clue to Kalo, Holly Throsby and Machine Translations.</p>
<p>?I&#8217;m a big fan of Spunk,? says Dan Crannitch vocalist for Adelaide&#8217;s Leader Cheetah. &#8220;The first time I heard The Shins ?Caring is Creepy&#8217;, it was on a Spunk sampler years ago. It&#8217;s a label that I&#8217;ve always respected and thought brings out incredible stuff. I really dig Aaron&#8217;s vibe.?</p>
<p>Leader Cheetah&#8217;s ?Bloodlines?, taken from their forthcoming album <em>The Sunspot Letters</em> and produced by US legend Kramer (Galaxie 500, Low, Robert Wyatt), is the opening song on the compilation. It&#8217;s also one of its strongest, recalling the weary harmony of Band of Horses and the quieter Neil Young. But how does a band from Adelaide get the dude who recorded all of Galaxie 500&#8217;s albums to fly out to the Adelaide hills and hang out?</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of mine met Kramer in the States and recommended us to him. It was only a matter of months before he flew over, stayed with me and recorded the album in a week. He&#8217;s a great guy and I totally dig what he brought to the table with the record. He&#8217;s a real one-take type of guy &#8211; he&#8217;d rather hack off a limb then let you cut and paste a vocal or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="l" data-src="/images/3002730/440x295-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif" width="440" height="295"/><br/>
Another discovery on the compilation is Townsville-based The Middle East. Taken from a forthcoming EP, their track ?Blood? is a simmering song that builds from sweet folky vocals to glockenspiel and group harmonies. It&#8217;s hard to believe that in the small music market of Townsville, the band were once forced to open for hardcore and metal bands. The compilation is a chance for The Middle East, like many on the record to broaden their audience, perhaps to one that doesn&#8217;t rely on Triple J&#8217;s Unearthed program for new Australian music.</p>
<p>&#8220;The music scene in town has been developing somewhat over the past few years or so&#8221;, says Rohin Jones from The Middle East. &#8220;Now I guess, the scene has a bit of diversity to it and new bands are springing up and playing some really good music. Because of the small size of the town the ?scene? is mostly made up of friends so any band is pretty well received.?</p>
<p>The pubs of Townsville are a long way from the grand stage of Melbourne&#8217;s Thornbury Theatre where the Middle East opened for Bill Callahan (aka Smog) on his most recent Australian tour. ?My friend Nathan and I laughed for a couple of minutes every day for a few weeks before the show because it was just funny that we were playing with such an iconic artist to us, and seeing him play with Jim White and Mick Turner was incredible,&#8221; says Jones.</p>
<p>Both The Middle East and Leader Cheetah have already benefited from their involvement with the compilation. The bands recently teamed up for a joint tour in support of their new records.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m most exited about the potential adventures that may occur on the road while being crammed into a van with seven of my friends and Leader Cheetah as well. Swimming in the ocean in every new town and meeting new people with different stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in Sydney, Curnow is hopeful that more bands on the compilation get in the van and out on the road.</p>
<p>?It would be great if some of the non-New South Wales bands could get together so I could see them play. Hopefully a few people hearing this compilation may make that possible.&#8221;</p>
