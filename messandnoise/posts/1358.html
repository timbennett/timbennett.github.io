                <h3>Australia&#8217;s shoegaze revival has been building momentum in the past few years, to the extent that the label &#8216;Roogaze&#8217; beginning to stick to proponents of the genre. So it makes sense that a showcase of local artists come together for a mini-festival under the Roogaze banner (&#8220;come and see &#8216;the scene that celebrates itself&#8217; celebrating itself!&#8221; reads the presser), taking over The Tote bandroom this Saturday May 7. Ahead of the show, Contrast&#8217;s <strong>JACK CROOK<em>* interviews Lowtide&#8217;s *</em>GABE LEWIS</strong>.

</p>
<p><strong>JACK CROOK: When I first moved to Melbourne, I remember thinking of you guys and Parading as being the forefront of a very small shoegaze scene, and also Lowtide were the closest thing I&#8217;d ever see to mbv or Slowdive, ever. But maybe I was oblivious, before there was any sort of revival locally or on a big scale were there other local bands that inspired your music? How does the scene now compare to a few years back?</strong><br/>
<strong>GABE LEWIS:</strong> I think there have always been tiny pockets but being so small it was hard to maintain a scene. In the last five years there&#8217;s been such an exciting explosion in Melbourne. It&#8217;s nice to have such a great selection to choose from when booking shows now. And we aren&#8217;t the odd ones out anymore! My inspiration for experimentation came from playing solo Three Month Sunset shows alongside other artists doing similar things with odd guitar setups.</p>
<p><strong>You are one of the only people I know pimp enough to rock a frullet. What&#8217;s the dopest describing word you&#8217;ve heard directed at you about your melon?</strong><br/>
Haha! Party at the front, business at the back. Although it&#8217;s party everywhere at the moment. Wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what people are saying about it behind my back.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IJmHbQUe8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe><br/>
</p>
<p><strong>So I&#8217;ve heard you&#8217;re a banjo demon, do you still play it? But more importantly when are you gonna run the motherfucker through three amps?</strong><br/>
I do occasionally play it, but no, I&#8217;ve never run it through any amps. I think it&#8217;d feedback like a bastard.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, let&#8217;s cut to brass tacks. Your experience with pedals and guitars rivals originators of the genre, I think anyways. I&#8217;m not asking you to give up any of your secrets, but not being smart enough myself to fuck with delay and reverb, I&#8217;m interested how much cash you would have spent overall to obtain this guitar sound? And did the sound come together easily?</strong><br/>
Oh god? I&#8217;d rather not consider how much I&#8217;ve spent. It&#8217;s my only guilt free spending. I&#8217;ll happily not eat for a week in order to buy something to experiment with to try and do something better, or at least differently.<br/>
Some people have cats. I have amps and pedals and guitars. Although, I have been selling off my guitars because I only use a couple of them. Next is to offload some of the amps! I think there&#8217;s about? 15 or something. Sorry Mum and Dad&#8217;s garage. So, towards $10,000, I guess? ugh.</p>
<p><strong>This shoegaze show has almost gathered more attention overseas than here. Do you think the genre is less appreciated here or have we just tricked a bunch of people on an international scale into thinking we actually aren&#8217;t shit?</strong><br/>
Ha! Well, I think locally audiences are more drawn towards new sounds/innovation and probably see us as rehashing old ideas. But that said, garage/psych/blues/rock/metal all seem to be able to thrive without any question of originality, so I don&#8217;t know. Shoegaze always got a hard time so I guess we&#8217;re just fulfilling the prophecy?</p>

</p>
<p><strong>The Lowtide album took a long time between you guys gathering attention and the release. It was Melbourne&#8217;s version of a My Bloody Valentine album. Are you going piff another one out soon or stick to the shoegaze formula and make people beg for that shit?</strong><br/>
At least we didn&#8217;t send any labels bust! There&#8217;ll be a 7? later in the year. We&#8217;ve been writing rough sketches for a new album, but are kind of restarting that now that Giles has his shiny new custom made Fender VI jobby. More strings to write with!</p>
<p><strong>Since the psych/shoegaze scene seems to more thriving in the UK and Europe, do you have plans to take this party overseas? Or do they have to beg there as well?</strong><br/>
Treat ?em mean, keep ?em keen! I&#8217;d love to get over there. It&#8217;d be really interesting to see what kind of response we get there as compared to here.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the funniest shit you&#8217;ve ever seen go down at The Tote?</strong><br/>
Oh boy? Ummm? I probably shouldn&#8217;t say. Or, I probably shouldn&#8217;t be able to remember.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this genre could gather mainstream radio attention ever again? Would you even want it it to?</strong><br/>
Gabe: I don&#8217;t think so. Not in the current format, at least. I mean, shoegaze is being touted by various artists as a sound they are embracing. It&#8217;s a similar aesthetic with a more mainstream core. So there&#8217;s a more palatable, but convoluted sound that&#8217;s more easily accessible. I guess we can benefit from this though, as it broadens the audience&#8217;s awareness of more underground movements. But that said, I don&#8217;t think the purist type bands would have the same success. Which is probably a good thing, right?</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this would sort of thick &#8216;gaze lineup work as well in other Australian cities?</strong><br/>
Gabe: I guess anywhere, as long as there&#8217;s a few active bands there, then there&#8217;s going to be enough people aware of it to be able to pull it off. At least we&#8217;d have all the band members at the gig!</p>
