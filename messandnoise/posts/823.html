<p><img class="r" data-src="/images/3029721/440x590-c.jpeg" src="http://messandnoise.com/wp-content/themes/messandnoise/img/spacer.gif"/><br/>
It&#8217;s 5pm and The Jezabels? Samuel Lockwood is still lunchless in Seattle. It&#8217;s the tail-end of the band&#8217;s relentless 21-date North American tour, and the guitarist has just stepped off a plane from Vancouver on an empty stomach. Three days ago he was playing a show in Whistler, a skiing destination in British Colombia, Canada.</p>
<p>?It&#8217;s such a beautiful place, probably somewhere I&#8217;d never have been to if I wasn&#8217;t in a band,? says Lockwood, who formed The Jezabels in 2007 with University of Sydney classmates Hayley Mary (vocals), Heather Shannon (keys) and Nik Kaloper (drums). ?Then you have days where it&#8217;s a drag, you&#8217;re pretty tired and you want to be back in Australia. But you sort of weigh it up, and it&#8217;s generally amazing.?</p>
<p>Now back in Australia, the band will kick off their most ambitious tour yet at the 5500-capacity Festival Hall tonight (June 1) in Melbourne. The scale of the show isn&#8217;t lost on Lockwood, whose personal expectations for the band were exceeded a very long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>So how&#8217;s the response been in the States?</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s been really good. We&#8217;ve a lot of radio support, but not major support here. It feels like when we were in Australia a few years ago. We&#8217;ve had some great shows in Washington, New York and Boston, and a few sell outs as well. It does feel strange because it feels like we&#8217;re going back in time.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the size of the shows?</strong><br/>
Yeah, as we were playing in Australia a few years ago, just doing a few shows outside of Sydney. We used to get really nervous but we feel better now. We&#8217;re more professional, I guess.</p>
<p/>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6x0XRR3rH3c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></iframe></p>
<p/>
<p><strong>Does that put things in perspective?</strong><br/>
The touring is a lot more rigorous here &#8211; it&#8217;s really full-on. We do three shows and one day off, and the off day is a big driving day. In Australia you can go away for a weekend, but you can&#8217;t do it for four weeks on end.</p>
<p><strong>Two years ago you were playing a small show at the <a href="/events/2002152">200-capacity] Workers Club in Melbourne [review [here</a>]. Have you gotten to the point where you stop pinching yourselves and think, ?This is where we belong??</strong><br/>
I can&#8217;t really put it into perspective myself what&#8217;s happening in Australia. We had different expectations, but a lot of us have exceeded what we thought would happen. We always thought our music was a little bit weird, so to be doing it at Festival Hall in Melbourne or The Horden in Sydney, it&#8217;s pretty awesome. We&#8217;re stoked. That&#8217;s all I can say. It&#8217;s weird and great.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been one particularly surreal moment that&#8217;s stuck out?</strong><br/>
For us, it was the Splendour show last year. We&#8217;d been recording for six months and we hadn&#8217;t done much in the few months before Splendour. That was when songs like ?Mace Spray? were doing well on radio. We went to Splendour not knowing what to expect and it really surprised us. People were really into it and a lot of people came. It was like, ?Whoa, what&#8217;s going on here??? Since then all these things happened &#8211; we got the Jager [Independent Music] Awards, the SMAC Award, all these things started happening in a row.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>The most amazing part of this story is that you&#8217;ve achieved this without virtually any commercial radio support.</strong><br/>
Yeah. We came down to Melbourne once and did a show and sold 75 tickets. That showed us that you can keep playing live and build an audience. It&#8217;s a hard road but it&#8217;s definitely worth it in the end. Also, in Australia, triple j&#8217;s support can&#8217;t be denied. They&#8217;ve been so supportive of us. It&#8217;s almost like we have commercial radio support because triple j are so powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe it also shows that those old models aren&#8217;t relevant anymore?</strong><br/>
We talk about this all the time when we&#8217;re touring. We got on a YouTube video behind a guy who&#8217;s a really good BMX rider called Danny MacAskill. He approached us, we didn&#8217;t know who he was. It was a Red Bull-backed and it we got a small amount of money for it, which was awesome. But then the first day it had 400,000 views, but now it&#8217;s had 20-million. Off the back of that we could do 300-capacity rooms all throughout Europe &#8211; and that&#8217;s just from a YouTube video. It&#8217;s a different world. In Australia, we don&#8217;t need a major label; overseas, we&#8217;ve got independent labels in each region. We haven&#8217;t had radio support overseas either, but we&#8217;re still able to sell tickets in each city. It feels good because you&#8217;re more empowered, I guess.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>Well, I think it gets back to the music, rather than all these other things which aren&#8217;t relevant.</strong><br/>
Exactly. I think there&#8217;s a big divide these days &#8211; There&#8217;s a lot of music that&#8217;s just thrown at the wall until something sticks, and then there&#8217;s a lot of music that&#8217;s really accessible too. There&#8217;s a big divide between commercial pop and other pop music, which is a bit more interesting, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to talk about the Australian Music Prize for a second. I thought your speech was really impressive &#8211; it was also quite humble, almost like you felt like it was premature.</strong><br/>
Well, we didn&#8217;t think we were going to win it. When we won it we were really surprised. Hayley [Mary, singer] wrote that in response to the feelings we all felt. We all read it and thought it was awesome &#8211; It&#8217;s amazing. I do think we deserved it, because I think our album&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s just something you think could never happen, but it did.</p>
<p><a href="/news/4441302">Read The Jezabels? Australian Music Prize speech in full</a></p>
<p><strong>Do you think it&#8217;s a kiss of death in a way because it&#8217;s your first record and there&#8217;s obviously a lot more to achieve.</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t really worry about that sort of stuff. We&#8217;re still learning so much about how we write and record and play live. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so awesome to achieve now. It&#8217;s validation that we&#8217;re doing the right thing. If we keep on the same trajectory, hopefully we&#8217;ll get better at what we do, and do some more interesting things. It&#8217;s just great &#8211; I think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>How are you going to spend the money?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;re doing a lot of touring right now, and because rent is really expensive in London, if we ever decide to settle down it&#8217;ll sit in a fund to pay the difference for the rent costs. Overseas it&#8217;s so expensive to tour, so we have a rainy day fund. It&#8217;s our war chest if you like. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Have you contemplated living overseas?</strong><br/>
We have. We bought a round-the-world ticket. But we&#8217;ve basically been doing tours and then going back to London for three or four days. We had a serviced apartment there. We haven&#8217;t been going back to Australia because it&#8217;s too expensive to go back between tours anyway. I couldn&#8217;t really live overseas for that long. I&#8217;m learning to like it a lot more, but it&#8217;s still very different. In Australia, there&#8217;s fresh air. It&#8217;s the kind of thing you take for granted. When you&#8217;re touring through Europe, driving around the northeast of France, it&#8217;s industrial and hazy. You just wish you were back in regional parts of Australia. It&#8217;s such a different part of the world.</p>

<p/>
<p><strong>What was your reaction to David Fricke&#8217;s praise of the band, both in his speech at The AMP and in <em><a href="/news/4451840">Rolling Stone</a></em>.</strong><br/>
You can&#8217;t really beat getting that sort of praise by a person who means so much in the critical world. He&#8217;s so respected &#8211; You don&#8217;t really know what to feel about everything until you get some sense of validation &#8211; and that&#8217;s the highest validation you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Did he come to watch a show?</strong><br/>
He came to watch the show in New York. Our manager said he saw him there, but apparently he doesn&#8217;t like to talk to people. Someone from our American label [Mom + Pop] said he really liked us, so that&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p><strong>Have you thought about a follow-up to <em>Prisoner</em> yet?</strong><br/>
We&#8217;ve thought about it a lot. We wrote the songs on <em>Prisoner</em> in the studio. It&#8217;s been a learning curve, and I think we&#8217;re going to go back to the old way: writing the songs in the rehearsal studio and actually learning how to play them, and then recording them. I think it&#8217;s a good plan. That&#8217;s about as far as it&#8217;s gotten really. We have a lot of individual ideas brewing that&#8217;ll be brought forward when it comes time to recording. Our manager has put aside some time next year &#8211; that&#8217;s as far as it&#8217;s gotten. Recording&#8217;s the best part of being in a band because you&#8217;re all in one place at one time and have something to focus on that&#8217;s quite stable. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Are you playing any new songs live?</strong><br/>
No, not at all. We&#8217;re still trying to catch up to <em>Prisoner* &#8211; we haven&#8217;t even learnt all those songs off it yet. We take a very long time to arrange anything. We have one more song left to learn, which we&#8217;ll do over the next few weeks. We&#8217;re still trying to catch up to ourselves. [*Laughs</em>]</p>
