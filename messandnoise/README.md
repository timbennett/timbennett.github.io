# messandnoise
Mess + Noise was an Australian music news website and discussion forum. It was taken over by Junkee Media and later shut down. This is a partial archive created during its decommissioning.

## Using the site
Download the project and open index.html in your browser. Scraped article data is also available in Python pickle format in articles.7z (of course, best practice is not to trust pickle files from the internet, so use with caution unless you trust me).
